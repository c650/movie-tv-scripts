All right, Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. - How are things at the library? - I told you. I couldn't close it. So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? Actually, you called me in here, but, yeah. All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manager. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so So that's the way it's done. I've, er, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here We have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beasley. Pam has been with us for forever. Right, Pam? Well, I don't know. If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a few years ago. - What? - Any messages? Er, yeah. Just a fax. Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet. - You haven't told me. - It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that. Look at that face. People say I am the best boss. They go, "We've never worked in a place like this. You're hilarious. "And you get the best out of us. " I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Shall I play for you? Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gifts for you Pa rum pum pum pum My job is to speak to clients on the phone about er, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And I'm boring myself just talking about this. - Whassup! - Whassup! I still love that after seven years. - Whassup! - Whassup! Whass up! Whassup. What? - Nothing. - OK. All right. - See you later. - All right. - Take care. - Back to work. Just before lunch. That would be great. Corporate doesn't interfere with me. Jan Levitson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because Well, not because I'm scared of her. Cos I'm not. But, um Yeah. Was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? Umm Me no get an agenda. - What? I'm sorry? - I didn't get any agenda. I faxed one to you this morning. Really? I didn't Did we get a fax this morning? Uh, yeah, the one Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? You put it in the garbage can that was the special filing cabinet. Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and It was for bills. It doesn't work with faxes. - Do you want to look at mine? - Lovely. Thank you. OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. - OK. - Don't panic. - No, this is good. This is fine. - Listen. Don't panic. - Alarm bells are ring-ding-ding! - We haven't decided. I've spoken to Josh in Stamford and told him the same. It's up to you to convince me your branch can incorporate the other. But it does mean there'll be downsizing. Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Er, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but downsizing? Question. How long do we have to Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? Go ahead. - Packman. - Hey, you big queen. - That's not appropriate. - Is old Godzillary coming in today? - I don't know what you mean. - I've been meaning to ask her. - Does the carpet match the drapes? - Oh, my God! Oh! That's horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? - I don't want to worry people. - Absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that. - So what does downsizing actually mean? - Well you guys better update your résumés like I'm doing. I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. Yeah, it'll be you. I have an important question for you. Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? Stop. That is ridiculous. Am I going to tell them? No. I don't see the point. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. - Hey. - Hey. - This is Mr. Scott. - Guilty as charged! Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me to start today. Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! Right here. Three Stooges. High five. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Erm Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Erm, Jim thinks they're good. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you. - Dwight, what are you doing? - What? - Clearing my desk. - It's not on your desk. It's overlapping. It's spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. - You can't do that. - Why not? Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing doesn't bother me. Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. You have messages from yesterday. Relax. Everything's under control. Er, Yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. This is so important, I should run to answer it. - What? - Come on. Six Million Dollar Man. Steve Austin. Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. - Don't we all? - I'm sorry? Nothing. If you're unhappy with your compensation, take it up with HR. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. I think I'm a role model. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all employees. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. The people I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. I want to set the record straight. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. - Assistant to the Regional Manager. - Can you tell me? Tell me quietly. Whisper in my ear. - I'm about to. - Can you tell us? - Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? - You don't know what it is. You tell 'em. With my permission. Go ahead. Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. - What if they downsize here? - Not gonna happen. - It'll be out of your hands. - It won't be, Stanley. I promise you that. - Can you promise that? - On his mother's grave. - What? - Well, yes, it is a promise. Frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. We need to know. I know. Hold on. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. I was in the meeting with Jan. She did say this branch could get the axe. Are you sure about that? Well, maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. Pam, information is power. You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? No, Stanley. You did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, they're gonna have to go through me. You can mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillun. If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Er, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Watch out for this guy. Dwight Shrute in the building. - This is Ryan, the new temp. - Introduce yourself. Be polite. Dwight Shrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. Er I've got a '78280Z. Bought it for - His profit. - New engine, suspension, respray. I've got some photos. Damn it! Jim! OK. Hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem? He put my stuff in Jell-O again. Real professional. The third time. It wasn't funny the first two. It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules. - What is that? - That is my stapler. No. Do not take it out. Eat it out, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. You can be a witness. Can you reprimand him? - How do you know it was me? - It's always you. - Are you going to discipline him? - Discipline. Kinky! Here's the deal, you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start as well as when to stop. And, yeah, Jim. Now is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. Nice. That's the way it is around here. - It goes round and round. - You should put him in custardy. Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. That's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all. Pudding. Pudding I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? - Yeah. - That's why we're all going out. For an end-of-the-week drink. - When are we going out? - Tonight, hopefully. - Hey, man. - What's going on? Hi, baby. Roy's my fiancé. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring. Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? No. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home. OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. It's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. You know what? You should come with us. It could be a good chance to see what people are like outside the office. - I think it could be fun. - It sounds good. Seriously, we gotta get going. Yeah, yeah. Um What's in the bag? - Tell her I'll talk to her later. - Definitely. All right, dude. Will do. Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, a boss second and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? Just follow my lead. Don't pip me, all right? Come in. - Corporate just said - You got a fax. Thank you. Can you come in here for a sec? I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. - What? Why? - Why? Well, theft and stealing. Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Post-it Notes. Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? If you steal a thousand Post-it Notes at 50 cents a piece, you know, you've made a profit margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam. Are you serious? - Yeah. I am. - I can't believe this. I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me. The best thing about it is we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. You been X'd, punk! Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. It was kind of a morale booster thing. We were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you God, we totally got you. You're a jerk. I don't know about that. What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out. We had to let him go. He sucked. - Hey. - Hey. How are you? I thought you were going for a drink with No. I just decided not to. - How's your headache? - It's better, thanks. - Good. That's great. - Is? - Yeah? - Um Are you - Am I walking out? - Yes. - Yes, I Do you want to - Yeah. Great. Let me just Oh, boy. - Listen, have a nice weekend. - Definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here.
Hiya. Can I help you out here? - I'm all set, thanks. - Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rose. That's a good idea. Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. I think it's important that we have this. I'm very, very excited. That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content. " What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second. - Do you really have to do that right now? - Yes. I should have done it weeks ago. Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying Hello? - Thanks, Dwight. - Retaliation. Dit fortit. That is not the expression. Well, it should be. This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right. Solitaire? Yeah, afraid so. - Six on seven. - I know. I saw that. So then, why didn't you do it? I'm saving that cos I like it when the cards go T- ts-ts-tch-tch-tch. Who doesn't love that? Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man? - All right. - Did you have a good weekend going there? - It was fine. - I bet it was fun. Oh, hey! This is Oscar. - Martinez. - Right. See? First-name basis. Great. We're all set. Well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please? Mr. Decker, please. It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day. You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that. - Thank you. - Get 'em in. Get in the cards! Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance. You know what? This is a color-free zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race. Er, this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind. - That's fighting ignorance with ignorance. - With tolerance. No. With more ignorance. Right. Exactly. - Instead, we need to celebrate our diversity. - Let's celebrate. Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Yes, exactly. Now, here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go. I have two. White and Indian. Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission? - Yes. - Thank you very much. - It would also help if you were seated. - OK. Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. I'm going to choose one and we'll act it out. The ground rules? - Run it by me and I'll run it by him. OK. Can we steer away from gay people? - Um - I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are also intolerant of gays, so paradox. Well, we only have an hour. - I figured it would save time. - Why don't we just defer to Mr - Mr. Brown. - Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that. It's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, looking through the cards, I noticed many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK. How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black? We'll reenact this with a more positive outcome. I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off. Let's have someone not involved in the reenactment. OK, I will play guy listening. Great. Guy listening. OK, anyone else remember? I remember. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening. Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer. Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess. OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin He's butchering it. Could you just let me Every time Every time black people want to have a good time, some idiot ass - I take care of my kid! - Wait a second. They always want credit for something they supposed to do! Stop it! You want a cookie? Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. At Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. Excuse me, but that's not all it takes to be a hero. Great. Well, what is a hero to you? A hero kills people, people that wish him harm. A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged. OK, you're thinking of a superhero. We all have a hero in our heart. Now, I need you to take these forms. This expresses the joint experience we had today. I want you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge. - I don't think I can sign this. - I can't leave until you do. Well, OK. It says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so I could sign something that says that I taught something, that I helped you teach something, so Pam! Where is she? - Pam, could we change something on this? - Michael, can I talk to you candidly? Sure. We both know that I'm here because of the comments that you made. Here's the thing. This office, I think is very advanced in terms of racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. - That's probably thrown you off a little. - It's not. I need your signature. I know. You told me that several times. - But you're not listening. I need a signature. - OK. My instructions from the Corporate offices are to put you through this seminar for the comments you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed. Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. - And you don't. - Don't worry about dating it. I won't. OK, thank you. "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. "I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness " Open-mindedness, is that even a word? " into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. "Signed, Daffy Duck. " He's going to lose it when he reads that. Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Well, could you have him call me after lunch? Thank you. "I pledge to always keep an open mind "and an open heart. " I do believe in that part of the pledge that I just read. But a pledge, come on. Who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look the guy, Mr. Brown he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears. All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good. We're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style, are we? Get out. - I'm sorry. - No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um thank you for coming in. Um Diversity is the cornerstone of progress, as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North. " And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace. OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim? Uh, is that it? Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on. It was kind of hard to hear. Yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um I have a customer meeting. Well, if you leave, we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. OK, well, since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian. - What part Native American? - Two fifteenths. That fraction doesn't make any sense. Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about. The suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on. OK, Michael, um Both my parents were born in Mexico. Oh, yeah And they moved to the United States a year before I was born. - So I grew up in the United States. - Wow. My parents were Mexican. Wow. That is That is a great story. - That's the American dream, right? - Thank Yeah. Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? - Something less offensive? - Mexican isn't offensive. - Well, it has certain connotations. - Like what? Like I don't I don't know. What connotations, Michael? You meant something. - Now, remember that honesty - I'm just curious. empathy, respect Jim! Jim! Hello? Hello? I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and Take a card, any card. Um And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead, OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so I want you to really go for it, cos this is real. This isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get her done. Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's Oh, this is a good one. - Um, hi. How are you? - Fine. How are you? Great. - Push it. I admire your culture's success in America. - Thank you. - Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on. Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on. - Who am I supposed to be? - No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that. "Lots of cultures eat rice" doesn't help me. Um Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan. - That's nice, Dwight. - OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it quick. - I like your food. - Outback steakhouse. I'm Australian, mate. - Pam, come on. "I like your food. " Come on. Stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! - Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real. - OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver. Oh, man, am I a woman? You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just thought, "Too soon for Arabs. " Maybe next year. Um You know, the ball's in their court. - What you watching? - Chappelle's Show. - Really? - I downloaded it on her computer. - I hope she doesn't mind. - No way. I think she likes this stuff. She's cute, huh? Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but Oh, no, the girl in the - sketch. - Oh, yeah. She's hot. - Hey. - Hey. You wanna go to the beach? Sure. - You want to get high? - No. - I think you do, mon. - Stop OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK. Kelly, how are you? - I just had the longest meeting. - Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi googi. Try my googi googi. Try my googi googi. Try my All right! All right! Yes! That was great. She gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority. Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your What's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your Oh. W- What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. He gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you. I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man, I should have gotten some food. Maybe some spagh-etti. - OK, Kevin, you can take that off. That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens, or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai. - It's collard greens. - What? - It's collard greens. - That doesn't really make sense. You don't call them collared people. That's offensive. Hmmm OK. Well, it's after five. So Thank you very much. Buena vista, Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you, Brazil. Nice. Um Hey. Hey. - We can go. - Sorry. That's fine. Uh Not a bad day.
Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. - Making copies. - I'm not making any copies. Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway. - Nothing new. - Lay them on moi. What? - There's nothing new. - That's not what you said earlier. Do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um Yes, in a way. Yeah. Like a specialist. So, which health plan have you decided on? I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, the works. None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely? I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan. The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan. - Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good. - Michael. - You gotta crack these things open. - We're doing this to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan. Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. - Um It won't be popular around the orifice. - It's your job. Well, it's a suicide mission, you know. - Michael Maybe I mean - There there Sometimes a manager like yourself has to deliver the bad new to the employees. - I do it all the time. - When have you ever done that? I'm doing it right now. To you. Last night on Trading Spouses Have you seen it? - No. I have a life. - Interesting. What's that like? - You should try it sometime. - Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is - Your problem. - Jimbo! Ha-ha-ha! There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers. - Gosh. - Yeah! That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales. - Really? - Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task that I am going to do. You know who would be great for this? Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it. Yes. I can do it. I'm your man. Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company, then this would be my career. And, er Well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train. OK. First, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire? - None. You're picking a health care plan. - We'll table that for now. Two, I'll need an office. The conference room should be fine. You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace. Yes. I have an office. Bigger than his. - No, you cannot use it. - OK, it's a workspace. Temporary workspace. You can use it. Thank you. If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already. What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people. In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. "A lion eats me and I'm dead. " Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead. There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible. - Dundler Mifflin. This is Pam. - Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks? Where are you? Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears. I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. - Everybody cool out there? - Actually, people are really unhappy. Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out Pam! Whoa! I'm sorry. I gotta go. I'm getting a call. No, you're not. I have to make a call after I finish my work. You know what? Just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce? - OK. - Thank you. Oh, here we go again. - Gotta go. I have to take this. - Still no one calling. - Dwight, what - Knock, please. - Please knock. This is an office. - It says "workspace". - Same thing. - Then why did you write "workspace"? Just knock. Please? As a sign of respect for your superior. - You are not my superior. - Then why do I have an office? - I thought it was a workspace. - OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of health care? - Yes. And my decision is final. - This is a ridiculously awful plan. - You cut everything. - Times are tough, Pam. Deal with it. - Did you cut more than you had to? - Sure. Why? You work here. Don't you want good insurance? Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system. If you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies. I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brainpower. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will. - Why would you raise your cholesterol? - So I can lower it. He literally won't come out of his office. He's gotta come out sometime. - To go to the bathroom! - Kevin. That's inappropriate. - Michael, can I talk to you? - I would love to but I'm busy. Rain check? Michael. Michael, please. Can we talk to you about this memo? What? Which memo? Dwight's health care memo. - Is it a good plan? - It's a great plan. - It saves the company a fortune. - It's a pay decrease. - Michael, he made huge cuts. - Cuts? What? - Dwight, did you make cuts? - Yeah, you said No! You know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? - I can handle that. - OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right? - This is not good. - It's ridiculous. - Did you talk to him? - What was that? You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic. - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing, Kevin. Do I know what the surprise is? Hell, no! It doesn't matter. They're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. "He has a surprise. He's cool. "What a great guy. I love him. "I love him. " OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. I believe that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do. We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential. I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Fair? Good. - I'll be in my office. - Workspace. You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise. - Where are you going? - Um Headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. Couldn't find the knob. So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free, picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, the room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend. I don't know of anything like that, but you might want to call those casinos directly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. So. Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? Cos I'm suffering from both. - I'm inventing new diseases. - Oh, great. Let's say my teeth turn to liquid and they drip down the back of my throat. - What would you call that? - I thought you were inventing diseases. That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion. - Nice. - Thank you. Calling you ask you a little favoroonie. Trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride. You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mine shaft? It's not really a ride. It says here that it's a 300ft drop. It goes 300 feet into the earth but it moves really slowly. - So it's not a free fall. - It's an industrial coal elevator. Uh All right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what Have you got Laser Tag or something? OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line Is It Anyway? Who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. - What are you talking about? - Someone forged medical information. - That is a felony. - Whoa. That's a pretty intense accusation. - How do you know that they're fake? - Uh, leprosy? "Flesh-eating bacteria. "Hot-dog fingers. "Government-created killer nanorobot infection. " - You did this, didn't you? - No. I know it was you. Fine. I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for anyone. - Killer nanorobots? - It's an epidemic. The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. - "Count Choculitis. " - Sounds tough. Why did you write that down, Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula? - Do you? - I think you need to confess the fact - Yeah. - What are you doing? Those are my keys. - Good luck. - Jim! Damn it! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let The light green - Jim Halpert. - Let me out. - Who is this? - You're fired. - You can't fire me. - I can. I'm manager for the day. - Clean out your desk. - Can you hold on? I'm getting the, er beep. - Jim Halpert. - Hey, Jim. It's Pam. Hey, Pam. How are you? - Good. How are you? - I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend. What are you up to? - I'm not bothering you, am I? - Not at all. - You're not doing anything? - I have nothing to do. Jim! This weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything. I might go to the mall. I need new shoes. Oh, interesting. What kind of shoes? - Hello? - Hello. This is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould. - This is Jan. - Hi. Dwight Schrute, Acting Manager, Scranton branch. I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert. - Who is this? - Dwight Schrute. From sales? Where's Michael Scott? He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office. Dwight, listen carefully. You are not a manager of anything. - Understand? - That's not entirely true. He put me in charge of picking the health care plan. Really? OK. When Michael gets back, tell him to call me immediately. Call you immediately. Good. Oh, listen. Since I have you on the phone, can I fire Jim? No. Please don't use my cellphone ever again. Oh, I thought this was your Hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaahh! Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, I see Angela. Angela? Waaaahhh! Hey, temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And faster metabolism. Did you get the kind with the cookies? Why don't you just eat it, OK? - And here you go, Stanley the manly. - Oh, thanks. This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day. Er Nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um because you didn't expect it. But you will You'll know it when you see it. Michael. Michael? Oh, Christ. I tried being rational, OK, and what happened? The employees went crazy. I got no help from Corporate. That leaves me with no options. I'm going to read your submitted conditions. When you hear yours, raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered. - What about confidentiality? - You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one. Inverted penis. Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered. Your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy. A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina. OK. Great. Dermatitis. Thank you, Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK. Now. Who wrote this hysterical one? - Anal fissures? - That's a real thing. Yeah, but no one here has it. Someone has it. - Do you think we should go? - I don't know. This is important. - What is he doing? - I don't know. Well? Well, what? You could be referring to anything. OK. The health care plan. Why did you put Dwight in charge? He was horrible. Dwight? Did you raise benefits? - I most certainly did not. - Oh, come on. That's horrible. Aah Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, damn! Oh I wish I had time to change it but Jan needs it by five. What time is it? It's after five. Oh Oh, it's awful! So. Well. OK. See you guys on Monday. What about the surprise? Oh Yes. Exactly. Thank you, Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is? - We all think you don't have a surprise. - I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr! When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See, I learned improv from the greats, like Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles. God, yeah Ah! This Robin Williams. Man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork. " Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. Oh, um Jan wants you to call her.
- Michael? - Oh, God. Dwight, come on - About the downsizing - There is none. But if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager? - Assistant to the regional manager. - So I needn't worry? Look, I talked to Corporate about protecting sales staff. They couldn't guarantee it if we downsize. - But we're not downsizing, so - Bottom line. Do I need to be worried? Mm, mm, mm. Maybe. It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired. " You're foir-ed. "Uh, you're foir-ed. " It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. "You're foir-ed. " I think if I had a catchphrase, it would be, "You're hired and you can work here as long as you want. " But that's unrealistic, so It's a real shame, cos studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work. - Why d'you do this? - I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's a scuttlebutt? Get set for Operation Morale Improvement, starring Michael Scott. I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad. Not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is Drum roll, please. Who is the birthday person? - Who is it? Who's the birthday? - Um Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up. Next person on the - calendar. - OK, um - That would be Meredith. - Yes! All right. Come on down, Meredith. - But it's not until next month. - Um Uh, OK. Great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise. - You still wanna have a party? - Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up! Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check, Captain. Eeee! Eeee! Eeee! Eeee! No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brrr-rrrp. Star Trek Well, for decorations, maybe we could - It's stupid. Forget it. - What? I was going to say maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. - Never mind. - No, I think that's a good idea. What color do you guys think? Well, there's green blue yellow - red - How about green? - I think green is kind of whoreish. - This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin but Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course, by saying that, she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her. These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook! So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. "Very good. Very delicious. " Meredith's allergic to dairy, so She's not the only one that's gonna be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not It's not just about her, so - It is her birthday. - Mint chocolate chip! How about mint chocolate chip? Hey, so listen I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance because of the downsizing. I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out. Do you want to form an alliance with me? - Absolutely, I do. - Good, good. Excellent. OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected At that moment, I was so happy. Everything Dwight does annoys me. Did you get your tickets? - To what? - The gun show. And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him but only in ways that would get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says, "Jim, here's a way. " There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally secret. Don't tell anyone. An alliance? What does that even mean? I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure. Um I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort. Jim? Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the paper products. - Did you tell Pam about the alliance? - What? No? - Just now? - Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam. - That's good. Pursue this. - I'm trying to. See what I'm doing? I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. There may be chatting, and giggling. - You gotta just pretend to ignore it. - Done. All right. Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this is Meredith's card. "Happy Bird-Day!" Um, let's see. Jim Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning "Just fudge the numbers. " Not bad. Pretty funny. I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh "Oh, Meredith. Happy birthday. "You're great. Love, Michael. " They seem awfully chummy, don't you think? - What do you think that's about? - Only one way to find out. I'm on it. - You are not going to believe this. - I believe it. - Tensions were high. - It was in the body language. - That looks good. What is it? Turkey? - Italian. Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion. Provolone Toby and Kevin are trying to get Angela kicked off. Good. Let 'em. It helps our cause. Well, if Kevin's in Accounting and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking They're forming an alliance. - I love their sandwiches. - I love them too. - Their bread's really good. - It's very good. Damn it. Damn it! God! OK, listen. We need to assume that everyone is forming an alliance to get us kicked off. God damn it! Why us? Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. Meredith, Meredith Meri Mary had a little lamb. Mary Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor. Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up? - I'm sorry to bother you. - Not at all. Come on in. My nephew is involved with a charity for cerebral palsy and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to you know - What? - Donate to the charity. Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. - Get that over here. - Thank you. No, I'm always good for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars. People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you $25. That's that's - That's very generous. - Oh, my gosh, well Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into morale. That's what I say, so - Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure, what's up? I don't know. I'm going a little crazy cos I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and Corporate about, like, staff issues. - Oh, no? - Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, "These people are my friends. " But he's, like, "This is confidential. You can't tell anybody. " I just feel like I want to aah - Promise me you're not gonna say anything. - No, I won't tell anybody. - This is between you and me. - OK. Yeah. - Jackpot. - That was beautiful. All her idea, too. Awesome. She's so great. Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath. - Hey. You wanted to see me? - Yeah. - What do you know about Meredith? - I don't think she'd be missed. There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight, OK? I just I need to know a little bit more about my friend. Name, Meredith Palmer. Personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. - Awards, multiple Dundees. - I know all that. I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside. She had a hysterectomy. - Which one is that again? - They remove the uterus. Oh, God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What do I do with a removed uterus? - It could be kinda funny. - I am on a deadline here. And just OK. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you, Dwight. That was a waste of time. OK, here's the deal. All right. Pam says one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday. - We have to be there. - I know, but there's no place to hide. Yes, there is. Behind the shelves. - Oh, my God. - What? What? - I know. I know exactly what to do. - Great. I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are at vision. This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. - I can hear and see everything. - Good. Michael? Are you done yet? - Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect. Thank you. Excellent. Here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet. - Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open. - So tape it down. - I can't. You won't be able to breathe. - I can breathe just fine. But if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box. Thank you. OK. Sur-prise! Oh Surprise! - No It's uh - It's surprise, Meredith! One, two Happy birthday to you - Find a key. - Happy birthday So do you want me to stay here and you know, stand next to the box? No, you need to go upstairs to the party - so people don't notice we're both gone. - Right That's good. Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me. birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you And many more! Last year, five years ago - Were you surprised? - Yes. You looked freaked, man. We said, "Surprise. " You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" - Why don't you have some of this cake? - Uh, I can't. - Come on. A little bit. - I can't eat dairy. - Oh, right. Too bad. It's so good. - It makes me sick. You know, if I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. Cos this is way, way too good. - He's in a box? - Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic. Hey, where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh, my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, Accounting are gonna do. It said specifically that Oh. Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up - a little morale boost. Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, your donation to Oscar's charity. - What was it, 25 bucks? - Well, you know, money isn't everything. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time. Yeah, well, three dollars a mile is gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give. Is Oscar around? I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know $25, one-time donation. I didn't think it was a per mile kinda deal. You know, so Well, that's what a walkathon is. - I know. - It says it right on the sheet. Look at the sheet. It says, "However many dollars per mile. " Got it. Yes. So it does. Um I just think it's kind of cheap to undonate money to a charity. No, no. That wasn't what I was No. It's not about the money. It's just It It's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape? - Yeah. - How many miles did he do last year? - Last year, he walked 18 miles. - Son of a bitch. That is impressive. - Happy birthday. - Read it out. Say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best. "Happy Bird-Day!" Um "Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here "where time stands still. " - I don't know about that. - That was Stanley. "Meredith, happy birthday. - "You're the best. Love, Pam. " - Aw! - Huh! Thanks, downer. - This is from Michael. "Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you "is that someone downsizes your age. " Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old. No, I I get it. - It's funny. - You didn't get the joke. That's cool. You know what? Actually I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um Oh, where's that? Oh, OK. Here's a good one. "Meredith, Liz Taylor called. She wants her age back and her divorces back. " Cos Meredith's been divorced, like, twice. Is that right? You're right. You're right. Yes. Divorce Um Oh, OK. "Meredith is so old " - How old is she? - If everybody could do it? - "Meredith is so old " - How old is she? "She's so old she went into an antiques store and they kept her. " That wasn't even mine. I got that off the internet. Website. Don't get mad at me. - Nice party, Michael. - This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers - I think we could have done better than that. - Phyllis wanted red. I didn't. Oh, boy You OK. We All right. People. Hold on, hold on. Just a second. We're losing sight of what is really important here and that is that we are a group of people who work together. I was I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizeable donation to Oscar's nephew's walkathon. $25. - Per mile. - Per mile, yes. When I retire, I I don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back. A check for the kids, and for the team. I want it to be, like "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't know. It was anonymous. " "Well, guess what. "That was Michael Scott. " "But it was anonymous. How do you know?" "Because I'm him. " Thank you, Michael. Come here. Don't cash that till Friday, OK? - Really? Today? - Yeah. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. - I could say something. - Don't do that. OK, I have something that totally tops the box. - Oh, tell me, tell me. - OK. I have convinced Dwight he needs to go to Stamford and spy on our other branch. But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover. That's perfect! If we can get him to drive to Connecticut and put peroxide in his hair - What the hell is this? Trying to cop a feel? - No, dude. No. - Just listen. Whoa. - Come on. God, I don't even know how to explain this. Dwight asked me to be in an alliance. And then we've just been messing with him because of the whole alliance thing. - It's just office pranks. - It's stupid. What the hell's he talking about? I have absolutely no idea. Come on. Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves. That's politics, baby. Get what you can outta someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
Hey. You ready? All right. Secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent. Excellent. Michael. Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops and I play basketball every weekend so I thought, "This might be kinda fun. " And I started messing around and Im sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans, so You know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together. Pam, Pam, thank you, ma'am. Messages, please. Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? - I think I should be on the team. - No. That's not me being mean. - That is based on your past behavior. - Please. When I let him come to my pick-up game - I apologized for that. - I vouched for you. I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm gonna do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar. - I can handle that. - Good. Excellent. It'll be fun. Because Corporate wants somebody to be here on Saturday and so we have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't wanna deal with that. It's why you have an assistant manager. Yes, it is. Assistant to the regional manager. - Same thing. - No, it's not. It's lower, so It's close. So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that should be - Jim. - God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. - Phyllis, can you believe this? - Keep me out of it. My fiancé has plans for us this Saturday so I really hope Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding. Kidding. Totally kidding. All right! Managing by walking around! This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. - Don't you do that. I've earned the right. - Fine, don't worry about that. And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood". Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. - He's temping upstairs. - What's up? - This is the foreman, Mister Rogers. - Not my real name. No, Darryl is Mister Rogers. - Darryl Rogers? - Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers. And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. The best-looking one upstairs. - Yeah. - You still getting it regular, man, huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job. Rapport. No, I know that the warranty's expired but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years. Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Which she got at her engagement shower. For a wedding that still has yet to be set. And that was three years ago. So, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on. - We're loading at one. - I see, you're chickening out on me. No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. That's the busy time. Well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh. Oh. You can dish it out but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock. All right, see you at one. Are we ready for the game? Yeah. I know. Grumble, grumble, but you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that dwarf from Lord Of The Rings. - Gimli. - Nerd. That is why you're not on the team. - Just trying to be helpful. - "I'll help. Elwyn Dragonslayer "Ten points, power sword. " That's him. So let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? - Stanley, of course. - I'm sorry? - What do you play, center? - Why "of course"? What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. I don't remember saying that. - I heard it. - Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um other starters Me, of course. I heard it that time. I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school. Um Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart. - I'm getting paid to skip lunch? - Yes. - OK. - Yes. This is business. The business of team building and morale boosting. - Uh who else? - I can help out if you need me. I will use your talents come baseball season. Or if we box. - I have a hoop in my driveway. - No. - I have a sports bra. - No, ridiculous. Michael, look. Close. All right. Uh Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight. - Yes! - Sorry, Phyllis. - Can I be captain? - No, I am. - Can I be team manager? - You're assistant to the manager. - Assistant team manager? - No. OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then. - Jim, take over the vacation schedule. - Oh, my God. Threat neutralized. Off the backboard! - Please don't throw garbage at me. - Oh, Pam, with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some pigtails, a little haltertop, tie that up. And something a little, just, youthful, for a change. - Just this once. - I don't think so, Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiancé. I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. - I think that goes without saying. - Maybe Angela would cheerlead. - Yeah, right. - I'll do it. Yuk. That's worse than you playing. Cos we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it. Suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good. Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays? - Just getting a tea bag. - He's running. He's running but he can't hide because one o'clock, you better bring your A game. Because me and my posse guys are gonna be in your face. - Right in your face! - Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's. Wo-ho. I like the way you think. I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser works on Saturday. No, that's not as much fun. - You know what? - What? - You're on. - OK. Cool. You're on. Don't screw this up. Classic beginner's mistake - eating before a game. Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you. Basketball? It was my thing in high school. And, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here. - You coming down? - Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones. - Gonna wish me luck? - Yeah, you're gonna need it. Is that trash talk from Pam? I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive and he wants to take the Wave Runner to the lake this Saturday so Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names, and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.

MICHAEL: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day.

Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I You know, an employee will go home and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No, man. I mean, I slave all day. "Nobody notices me." The next thing you know, the employee smells something terrible coming from the neighbor's house. The neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So, you ready for the Dundies? (SIGHS) PAM: You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away?

So, why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners? We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show off your Dundies to the camera? Oh, I can't, because I keep them hidden.

Michael has taped every Dundies Awards, and now he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights. song that I think we're gonna play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight. (PLAYING FLUTE) A little bit of Pam all night long A little bit of Angela on the thing A little bit of Meredith everywhere This is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great. A little bit of Roy eating chicken crispers A little bit of Kim with some ribs A little bit of It was you. Live and learn. It wasn't, I swear. Yeah, it was. So, what's the joke? You're not perfect, either. We're not laughing at you, Dwight. So, who are we laughing at? Just something somebody wrote. Who, Dave Barry? No, no. Just something that was written on the ladies' room wall. What is it? Who wrote it? It's kind of private. It's about Michael. (LAUGHING) That is defacement of company property, so you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less. Okay, now I'm laughing at you. (PAM LAUGHING) Will Her Highness Jan Levinson-Gould be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton? JAN: (STUTTERING) It's a two-and-a-half-hour drive from New York, Michael. Well, you could take the bus, you could work on the way here, sleep on the way home? No. Come on, Jan, this is important. I mean, this is validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So But we don't approve of this, Michael. You only have the budget for one office party a year, so we're not paying for this. Um Could you Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. I just wanted to talk to you for a second about that. MICHAEL: What What is I mean, come on, Jan. What, it's a You're dropping an A-bomb on me here. Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you? Well, yeah! I mean what is What No, you can't You already had a party on May 5th for no reason. No reason? It was the 05-05-05 party. And you also had a luau. It happens once every billion years. And you had a luau. And the Tsunami Relief fundraiser, which somehow lost a lot of money. Okay, no, that was a fun-raiser. I don't really understand that. I think I made that very clear in the flyers. Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have Fun. F-U-N. a Tsunami fun-raiser, Michael. Well, I think a lot of people I mean, that just doesn't make sense. were very affected by the footage. This is a little character I like to do. It is loosely based on Karnak, one of Carson's classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hotdog stand behind the warehouse. (RIPPING) Name three businesses that have better healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin. Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan. And it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two-drink minimum. We'll be fine, but I just wish people were gonna be drunk. PHYLLIS: Dwight, get out of here! No, no, no What are you doing in the ladies' room? It's not what you think. No! Why were you in there? What were you doing in there? You are a pervert! I am not. The Dundie Award for Longest Engagement goes to Pam Beesly. Pam, everybody! (MICHAEL WHOOPING) When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting. Yes. MICHAEL: Thank you, Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say on Pam's behalf? ROY: We'll see you next year. MICHAEL: Yeah! (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Hope not. Hope not. I'm not changing that. That's the best one. No, it's hilarious. You're right. I just think, "World's Longest Engagement," we're all expecting it, you know? That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier. Well, I'd think if you use the same jokes, it just comes across as lazy. Oh, "lazy." Uh-huh. Excuse me, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies' room for a reason, and if you cannot behave like ladies, well, then you are not going to have a bathroom. You're taking away our bathroom? We are going to have two men's rooms. But where would we go? Be prepared to hold it, folks. From 9:00 a. M Okay, okay, look PAM: Michael? Yes? Dwight's banning us from our bathroom. Okay, well, that's ridiculous. So, just don't I don't have time for this right now. There needs to be repercussions for people's behavior. Just don't talk, don't talk Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad. But, what the hell, everybody? I mean, God! The Dundies are about the best in every one of us. Can't you see that? I mean Okay, we can do better. So tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us. Yes! MICHAEL: Yeah. Not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever. (CLAPPING) Best Dundies ever. (SIRENS WAILING) (TRUMPETING) Welcome to the Eighth Annual Dundies Awards. DWIGHT: Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short. I have wrap-it-up music and I am not afraid to use it, Devon. (O.P. P PLAYING) (SINGING) The Dundies, how can I explain it? Or would you like to hate it? I'm happy that you all made it You never had to work so hard And feel no one notices You're just a name and number And no one even says hello Card! OSCAR: The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party. And you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there, but the kid's having a really good time, so you You're kind of there.

I did, and why didn't you, Stanley? I did. My wife's name is Teri. Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Teri. It's this person whose hand I'm holding, Michael. (BREATHING HARD) VOICE: Oh, yeah. Shut it. Good. Speaking of relationships, of all ways, shapes, and forms, I was out on a very, very hot date last night with a girl from HR, Dwight. Really? We don't have any girls from HR. No, that For the sake of this story. And things were getting hot and heavy. DWIGHT: Yeah? And I was about to take her bra off Yeah? when she had me fill out six hours' worth of paperwork. Like an AIDS test? No. God. (MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT) MICHAEL: All right. So, let's get this party started! Hey, let's go to Poor Richard's. Yeah, let's get out of here. Guys, where you going? Pam, the show's just getting started. Sorry. (CLEARING THROAT) MICHAEL: And now, to someone who goes Are you staying? Yeah. Gotta eat somewhere. MICHAEL: quietly about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts. The Busiest Beaver Award goes to Phyllis Lapin! MICHAEL: Yeah! Way to go, Phyllis. Nice work, per usual. This says, "Bushiest Beaver." What? I told them "Busiest." Idiots. It's fine. Well, we can fix it. We'll fix it up. You don't have to display that. Because that's what happens every time He's a jackass. Every year. No. Come on, I'm going to Poor Richard's. No, I don't wanna go. I don't want to. Pam.

Somebody who I think a lot of us cannot keep from checking out. The Hottest in the Office Award goes to Ryan, the temp! MICHAEL: Yeah! (ALL CLAPPING) You sexy thing Sexy thing, you Here you go. Hanging and a humming and a huh Come from baby? (WHOOPING) There you go. There you go. What am I gonna do with the award? Nothing. I don't know what I'm gonna do. That's the least of my concerns right now. And the Tight Ass Award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has a great caboose. So, come on down. No. (LAUGHING) (SLURPING) I think those might be empty. No, no, 'cause the ice melts, and then it's, like, second drink. Second drink? The Spicy Curry Award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here! There you go. "Spicy Curry." What's that mean? Not everything means something. It's just a joke. Yeah, but why'd you give it to me? I don't know. I just This is a bowler. I know. It's They didn't have any more businessmen. Yeah, but everyone else Just sit down, Kelly. (SIGHING) It's so freaking hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! MICHAEL: I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room. But, you know, you do what you can do. (TINY DANCER PLAYING) Here we go. He's early with the cue. I've gotta go. You have won a tiny Dundie (HOWLING) Sing it, Elton! Hey, thanks, guys. Hey, where you guys from?

So, if you wanna Hey! You know, cool it, guys, really. MAN: You suck, man. You suck. Let's cut it. (CLEARS THROAT) I had a few more Dundies to give out tonight, but I'm just gonna cut it short and wrap it up, so everybody can enjoy their food. Thanks for listening, those of you who listened. (MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT) This last Dundie is for Kevin. This is the "Don't Go In There After Me" Award. It's for the time that I went to the bathroom after him and it was really, really smelly. There you go. Yay, Kevin! (PAM WHOOPING) For Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom! Yeah. All right, Kev! (WHOOPING) Hey, I haven't gotten one yet. MICHAEL: Yeah. Yes, I have not gotten one, either. JIM: So, keep going. More Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! ALL: Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! Dundies! All right, all right, all right, all right, okay. MICHAEL: All right. We'll keep them rolling. Okay, this is the Fine Work Award. This goes to Stanley for all the fine work he did this year. PAM: For the fine work. Fine work, Stanley! MICHAEL: You know you did. Hear, hear! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Well, last year I got Great Work, (LAUGHING) So I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get Smelliest Bowel Movement like Kevin. And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesly. I think we all know what award Pam is gonna be getting this year. It is the Whitest Sneakers Award, because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on. Get on down here! Pam Beesley, ladies and gentlemen! Oh, here we go. I have so many people to thank for this award. Okay, first off, my Keds, because I couldn't have done it without them. PAM: Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for emceeing tonight, because this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight, too. So, finally, I want to thank God, because God gave me this Dundie and I feel God in this Chili's tonight. (WHOOPING) Pam Beesley, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you. Yeah! (SIGHING) (BOTH SIGHING) JIM: What a great year for the Dundies. We got to see Ping and we learned Michael's true feelings for Ryan, which was touching. And we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs, which, for me, has ruined them for life. ((I'VE HAD) THE TIME OF MY LIFE PLAYING) What? Nothing. Okay. What? I don't know. What? Oh, my God! You are so drunk. Did you get that? Please tell me that you got This is all going to be on This woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue! Grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a Sheriff's Deputy. Well, he's a volunteer. Don't get into that now. DWIGHT: We need something to cushion her head. (SINGING PARODY) Throw pillow, a cushion Okay, I'm gonna use my shirt. PAM: Get off of me. DWIGHT: No! MAN: I'm sorry, sir, you're gonna have to put your clothes on. People are trying to eat. I can't. Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let me see. I made Pam laugh so hard that she fell out of her chair and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost. Oh, my God! I just want to say that this was the best Dundies ever. (SCREAMING) Careful, careful, careful. We have a strict policy here not to over-serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off of other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license, and she is not welcome at this restaurant chain ever again. Great work tonight. Watch your step. Excellent. Thanks. I had to check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion. Yes, that, too. But, I mean, with the audio. Great work. I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall. No, you don't. Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. All right, easy. You're almost there. Hey, can I ask you a question? Shoot. I just wanted to say thanks. It's not really a question. Okay, let's get you home, drunk. All right. Bye. Good night. Have a good night. Thank you, Angela.
(PHONE RINGING) (CLEARING THROAT) Hey, what's up? Hey. Any e-mails today? I don't think so. No? Check your spam folder. There it is. What? "Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson." Well done. Kidding. Topical. MICHAEL: I am "King of Forwards." It's how I like to do business. Everybody joking around. We're like Friends. I am Chandler and Joey. And Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer. So, the monkey does the sex thing right here. That's funny. That's funny. Not offensive, because it's nature, educational. Do you want the link? 'Cause then you could forward it around. Consider it? Maybe, maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I don't know if MICHAEL: Come on. What has two thumbs and likes to bone your mom? This guy! MICHAEL: Oh, you are so bad. (BOTH EXCLAIMING) This guy is out of control. He is a madman. Better get the bleep button ready for him. Bleep-bleep. What's up, Halpert? Still queer? MICHAEL: Todd Packer and I are total "BFF." "Best Friends Forever." He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out, and we met this set of twins, and Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought them back to the motel, and then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. Okay. Grade-A gossip for you. Right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why. Are you kidding? Everyone knows why. You don't know? Okay, check this out, all right. What? So, here's the story. Yeah? So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she's totally incompetent. Really? Here we go. Buckle up! It's gonna be a bumpy one! We're talking blonde incompetent, right? Oh, yeah. Like, 10 words a minute? Talking? Well, to be fair, blondes, brunettes, you know, there are a lot of dumb people out there. Right. They are women, right? (EXCLAIMING) I didn't say it, I didn't say it! Come on, I said it. And then suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch. What'd I tell you about the bleep button? Hey, what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? This guy. Meant to ask you, can you think you can get somebody to drive me around because of the DUI situation? Bad boy. Ryan? Come on, kid, let's go. Man, that Todd Packer can do anything. Except pass that Breathalyzer. You a big William Hung fan? Why does everybody ask me that? Who the hell is that? (EXCLAIMING) I'm really excited to meet your mom. You are? My mom is coming in to visit. She lives, like, two hours away, and she doesn't have a cell phone. Which is cool, 'cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day, and I keep looking over at the door, hoping she'll walk in. I'm excited to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody. Oh, yeah? Good. 'Cause I have a lot of questions. Oh, really? Yeah. "As a child, did Pam show any traits "that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?" Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot. Yes! Forward it like it's hot, forward it like it's hot. Old school. Michael? Yes, Toby? I need to talk to you in your office, it'll just take two seconds. (CLEARING THROAT) Literally two seconds? Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of his family. The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So corporate asked me to do a five-minute review of the company's sexual harassment policy. No. No, Toby, no. It's really not a big deal. It is a big deal. It's a big deal. What are we supposed to do, scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on. And then, corporate is gonna send in a lawyer What? No. Just to refresh you on our policy. What? He No. Okay, what is a lawyer gonna come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious e-mails? Or not tell jokes? Maybe not some of them, maybe not inappropriate ones. There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke. Everyone. Hello, everyone? Hi. Sorry to interrupt, I know you're all busy, and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So take it away. Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five-minute review of the company's sexual harassment policy, so I'll go over that later. MICHAEL: I wish you luck, Toby, I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands. And I just can't wait to see how you handle it. A guy goes to a $5 lady of the night and he gets crabs. So the next day, he goes back to complain. And the woman says, "Hey, it was only $5. "What did you expect, lobster?" This is what's at stake. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse, where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So Here they are. Guys. Wondering if I could get your help for something? I am looking for a new joke to tell. And it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So what you got? Like, a joke, a knock-knock joke? Yeah, no, well, I mean, better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. You know? Well Those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get them, like, "Queers R Us"? "Boys R Us." All right, all right, well, good, yeah, but you know, a joke, but not necessarily at my expense. So what've we got, like Man, we could see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide that. Good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with. Okay. But that was still about me, so Hey, hey. What? So you don't have the biggest package, don't feel bad. I don't feel bad. I think he feels bad. No, I don't. Well, you look like you feel bad Okay. 'Cause it's a little package. Well, you know not exactly A little package! what I was looking for, but thanks, guys. Thank you. You look good in those pants. He gets it from his mama. (ALL EXCLAIMING) So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam? I just wanted to say that, just, my mom's coming in today. MILF. Thanks, Kevin. Usually, the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke. She's coming in today, and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her. Great point. Thank you. In fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act every day like Pam's mom is coming in. All right, that's it. If anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back. It is over? TOBY: Yes. MICHAEL: No. I can go over it with you. I know, I know, it's good. It is not over. It is not over till it's over. TOBY: It's over. Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't, because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously. E-mail forwards. Exactly. Can we afford to lose e-mail forwards? Do we want that? I hate them. You send me these filthy e-mails, and you say, "Forward them to 10 people or you'll have bad luck." Give me a break. Stanley? How about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we gonna just take it away? That is my daughter, she goes to Catholic girls' school. I'm taking it down right now. What about office romance? Office relationships are never a good idea. So let's just try to avoid them, but if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR. All relationships? Even a one-night stand? I think the old honor system was fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee, and believe me, I could have. Yeah, Meredith. No, no, Catherine! Remember her? Remember how hot she was? DWIGHT: Yes. She would have definitely slept with me. She wasn't that hot. Yes, she was. TOBY: Okay, you know, Michael Damn it, Kevin. I'm in an office relationship. It's special. She's nice, she's shy, she's actually here if you wanna meet her. Hold on a second. Oh, my God. Put on a shirt. Put on I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop. What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? Would that be crossing the line? TOBY: No. What if they made out in front of everybody? TOBY: Well, that would be MICHAEL: At home? And I told everybody everything about it? Okay, I'm lost. Okay. Well, then, let's act it out. Pam, you will be Girl A, and Girl B will be Okay, we'll use the doll. Pam? Pam. I wish Todd Packer was here, 'cause he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to join us? Hey! We have to watch Toby's video that he's showing us, in order to brainwash us, and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Gonna be fun. Got microwave pizza. What do you say? Jim? No thanks, I'm good. That's what she said. Pam? My mother's coming. That's what she said. No, but, okay, well, suit yourself. Hey, Toby. Hey, Dwight. You said that we could come to you if we had any questions. Sure. Where is the clitoris? On a website it said, "At the crest of the labia." What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like? Technically, I am in Human Resources, and Dwight was asking about human anatomy. I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly. You know, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that. Good. Good. And I should get back to work. Okay. In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios, and ask ourselves, "Where is the line?" "The Natural Redhead." MAN: Hey, Marie. Hey, Joe, Mike. Settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead? Stop the video! We go Stop it right there. What? That's that girl from that thing. I banged this girl right here. That's her? Yes, this is the one, you remember? No, the party? DARRYL: Yes! You banged her? Yes, right here. You are a naughty girl! MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait. Hypocrite! DARRYL: Leave those lips alone! Okay, she is a hypocrite. That is such a scam. Okay. Yes? Yes, I did. Okay, well, we can talk about that later, then. Okay, you are never gonna believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that corporate gave us, Darryl banged her And he's about 90% sure. (DOOR OPENING) Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town, we got lost for half an hour. I don't have any DUIs, so I can drive myself, but thanks. Where is Michael "Snot"? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably. So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley. I know a lot of lawyer jokes. I love lawyer jokes. Well, it's probably because you don't get them. When I said before that I was "King of Forwards," you gotta understand, that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who was just delivering drugs from one guy to another. You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem? The problem is that I am the boss, and apparently I can't say anything. Well, that's true, in a way, you can't say anything. Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan? Do you need to see the video again, Michael? No, I've seen the video. He talked the whole time. No, I didn't. MICHAEL: What? Attention, everyone. Hello. Yes, I just want you to know that, this is not my decision, but from here on out, we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here, we must only discuss work-associated things. And you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny, or witty, or do an impression, I will no longer ever do any of those things. Does that include "that's what she said"? Yes. Wow, that is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so That's what she said! Michael! MICHAEL: Come on! JAN: Michael, please. There he is. Please. PACKER: Come on. You would have done the same, you just didn't think of it first. Michael. Michael, please, I really It's That's It's not my sense of humor. Okay. Hello. Jan, Mr. O'Malley, this is my lawyer, James P. Albini. Your what? I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in free speech issues. And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits. This guy does it all. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Michael, Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer. What? Mr. O'Malley is our corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer to protect the company, as well as upper-level management such as yourself. So I'm not in trouble? I'm so used to being the "bad boy." I am so used to fighting corporate, that I forget that I am corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney, to protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems. Okay, well, let's get you out of here, James. I think we're under an hour still, so. Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here. I know. Well, we'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in. Hello. Oh, my God. I finally made it. Hello. I love my mom. Okay, that's probably the most obvious statement ever. Okay. This is all yours? Yeah, I'm in charge of this whole area. Oh, my goodness, that's great. So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey, pack your bags, I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh, my God, that's incredible, where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going. Just be out of here by 5:00." (LAUGHING) PACKER: Boom! This is where I used to keep my computer. Oh, right, I remember, with the picture. But then I moved it. Yeah, yeah. But I switched stuff around, because I actually needed, like, more room for organization. Sure. So this is, like, an organization station. Oh, there he is! Hey! How are you? Hey, handsome. ROY: You look great. Oh, thank you. So, we ready for dinner? Well, you know, actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time. I don't believe that. Okay, I'm gonna go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? A little classical, little oldies? Anything is fine. All right, I'll see you. (DOOR CLOSING) So, which one is Jim? Mom. I just wanted to know. No, it's All right, okay. Okay. Ten minutes. Okay. Then we can go to dinner. I'll make myself busy. There's this guy, he's at a nymphomaniac convention. And he is psyched, 'cause all these women are smoking hot, perfect 10s, except for this one chick, who looks a lot like KEVIN: Phyllis? Yeah. No, no, no, that crosses the line. Ex-squeeze me? Not you. Kevin, just unwarranted, hostile work environment, Kevin. Well, Packer said it. No, you said it, he pointed. A point is not a say. Look, Kevin, we are a family here, and Phyllis is a valued member of that family, like a grandmother. I'm the same age as you, Michael. I don't know about that. We're the same high school class Well, I have a late birthday, and usually September is the cut-off point. You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line, and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner. You mean, where my desk is? Yes, your corner, go. Okay. I have a lot of work to do, anyway. Oh, my. They really got to you, didn't they? They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. And know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is an incredibly, incredibly attractive person. Come here, give me a kiss, come on. Michael, come on, you don't have to worry. I'm not gonna report you to HR. I'm not I'm not worried! You know what? The only thing I am worried about is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody. Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am upper management, and it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to. He said what?
MICHAEL: I'm an early bird and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise and I have worms. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) MICHAEL: Oh, breakfast. I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. Yummy, yummy, thank you, Ryan. What was the thing you needed me to come in early for? Um The sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. But, thank you. And why don't you just take a couple hours. Office is yours. Home Alone, Risky Business. Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you want to do. I'm just going to take a nap in my car till work starts. Okay. See? Healthier, got to watch those carbs. Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner, investing in real estate. Diversifying. Smart. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property, and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you. And it worked. Yes. They should bring the stocks back, people would obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers. Maybe. PAM: Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is, that it's up to me to revive him. You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it. No way. Let's do this. Here, try paperclips. Oh, wait, this message, for Dwight. Perfect. You should go. Yes, yes. Final walk-through. Sign the papers at the condo. You have your lawyer there? I don't need one. Can I be your representative? I think I should be there. I don't need representation. No, no. No, I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code. No, Dwight. Please. I'm always the guy that you rely on at work. Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo. It's completely personal. So, you're taking a personal day? Except that it's about my living arrangement and as boss I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work. Please. I'll make you proud. Okay, fine. Yes, you can come. Yes. As your representative? As my associate. Same thing. No, it is not. I have been Michael's number two guy for about five years and we make a great team. Why, we're like one of those classic, famous teams. He's like Mozart and I'm like Mozart's friend. No, I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart, you're gonna get a bullet in your head, courtesy of Butch Cassidy. (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS) Most honorable Pamela. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies. You headed out? We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So, why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day. Okay. Very good. Have a great time. We will. Did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines? Yeah, I changed them to your new address. Good. The Small Business Man? Yep. Maxim? American Way? CRACKED? Yes, I changed your CRACKED magazine subscription. How about Fine Arts Aficionado Monthly? No? Okay. Well, could you get on that, 'cause I don't just read CRACKED. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. See you soon. What kind of shocks you got on this baby? I don't know, regular, normal ones. Nothing fancy, not my style. What are you doing? I want to put the top down. What are you No, Dwight. It's 50 degrees outside, please. But then no one can see us. I Just Would you put it up? Okay, fine, just leave it down. Whiner. Check it out. Terminator. I do not understand what you spend your money on. Hey, Oscar. These new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter? Yeah, it's a terrible system, I know. What does "2005 Season" mean? Wait a minute. What is this? It's a scoreboard. What? Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out. Really? KEVIN: Or when we're bored. Oh, my God. Wait, this goes back two years. We're bored a lot. (JIM EXCLAIMING) Sweet. Yes, so close. I really love the "paper triangle flicking and hitting things" game. Yeah. We call it "Hate Ball." Why? Because of how much Angela hates it. Hey, do you guys have any other games? Sometimes we play "who can put the most M&M's in their mouth." You play that. You should ask Toby to teach you "Dunder Ball." Home, sweet home. Which one's yours? Right there. My sanctuary, my party-pad. Someday, I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree, push them back Wait. No, it's this one right here. Home, sweet home. So that's what this sound is all day. Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association. Oh, hey, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill, Mr. Bill. (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh, no, Mr. Bill! SNL. When they pull him apart? He would always get rolled over by something. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. This is smaller than your old place. Yes, well, I'm buying it. I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. He's kind of an idiot. DWIGHT: Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin Moes. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex. Are we ready to sign some papers? Actually, no, we have a couple of questions. About the neighborhood. It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles. It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood. Oh, good, that's good. It's good to be accommodating of that. Let's go check out the master bedroom. Stanley, I just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you? You got any games? Yeah, I got a game. It's called "work hard, so my kids can go to college." Fair enough. This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are, like, 17 feet high. We have cable readiness right there. I'm going to totally pimp this place out. I'm going to put a surround sound system. I'm going to put a plasma screen right against this wall. Oh, terrible idea. Here's where I'm putting my bed, right here. No, no, no, no, this is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor, totally smashed. Well, then I will get a warranty. Warranties don't cover it. Plus they're a rip-off. Well, then I won't get a warranty. Wait. So, that's the problem, it's solved. What? NEIGHBOR: I don't hear you practicing. (WHISPERING) Listen. Can you hear that? (DOUBLE BASS PLAYING) Oh, man, these babies are thin. (HUMMING OLYMPIC ANTHEM) This scented candle, which I found in the men's bathroom, represents the eternal burning of competition, or something. It smells like cookies. Yes, it does. Yes, it does, my friend. Okay, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids. Now, the bronze are really blue and they're also the backside of the gold, so no flipping. Okay, honor system. ANGELA: I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games, just not at work. Let the games begin. (ALL HUMMING ANTHEM) And then I just need you to sign here at this arrow. What kind of mortgage did you get? Ten year. Well, 10 over 30. So 30 year total. What? What? You said 10. Ten year fixed, over 30, 30 year total. Oh, 30 years. Okay, okay, okay. Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-70s. All right. Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I have an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live. Okay, all right. Oh, boy. Okay, now, this is it. Whenever you're ready. Yeah. Oh, okay, is that supposed to come off? Actually, yeah. DWIGHT: Hey, look, cool, carpenter ants. I'm going to take a little breather for a second, excuse me. We'll be here waiting for you. Oh, man. A 30-year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. Now, if I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people. CAROL: Whenever you're ready, Michael. You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name. Could you help me out, Pam? Jim, they refer to it as "Flonkerton." In English, "box-of-paper snowshoe racing." Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton. The thing about Jim is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens. So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone? I'll do it. Yes, Phyllis. (ALL CLAPPING) Phyllis. Phyllis, if you just put your foot right through here, right through the flonk. The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That I don't What? I don't know if you showed me the same unit or not. Michael, this is the unit you saw. And where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles. Who told you that? And as far as I can tell, I'm the best-Iooking person here. There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-Iooking person in the development. It's just sort of common sense. Because if you are, then you've no place to go but down. Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom. That's an extra income for you. No, no. I'm not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walking. You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now. I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. Look, I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner, diversified. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun. Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? (LAUGHING) Here we go. Here we go. WOMAN: Go, go, go! MAN: Pair of shoes. Dig deep. Dig deep. (ALL EXCLAIMING) It's Phyllis, Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton. Flonkerton. Thank you, delegate from Iceland. Wow, okay, no one else should even try. Gold medals. Give him medals. Wow. (EMPLOYEES EXCLAIMING) There's something else, Dwight, I want to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today. Oh, you didn't have to No, no, I insist, I insist. Because you've really done some great work, great work. And that is why I'm going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent. (EXCLAIMS) Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. I rewarded Dwight with the room and he is rewarding me back with $500 plus utilities. I don't even know what to say. I'm thinking, lock you into a four-year commitment. We'll go month-to-month after that. Or until I start dating, have a girlfriend and then, you're You know, you're gone. So Question. Where can I put my terrarium? What the hell is a terrarium? It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards. Oh, so, an aquarium? That will not come into this place, okay? Question. Oh, my God. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires. PAM: Are you sure you don't want to play? I'm sure. Come on, Angela, don't you have a game? I have one, yes. Well, let's play. What is it? I call it "Pam-Pong." I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you. We're friends. Apparently. JIM: Very nicely done. Okay, so, I think that's H.O.R. For Stanley and H.O. For Phyllis. Are you calling me a ho? Oh, my God. Phyllis coming alive, I like it. Question. What about car-pooling? Who pays for the gas? We take separate cars. Okay, question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine? Why would we do that? Just for fun. No. Okay, question. Who's the primary on the fire insurance? (MIMICKING BUZZER) Game over. Offer revoked, Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy and help out a friend and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh, God, I'm Okay. DWIGHT: Thank God. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine-bedroom farmhouse. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although, two bathrooms would have been nice. We just have the one. And it's under the porch. Who had somebody from Vance Refrigeration? I did. Ryan Howard. Ryan, gold medal. I made something for our closing ceremonies. What? Oh, my God. Where did you have time to make that? Automatic voicemail. All right, Pam, all right. Nice work. You know, you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15-year on our beet farm, we paid it off early. Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst. People love beets. Nobody likes beets. Everyone loves beets. Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet. Let's get this roof going. Stop it! Final lap, final lap. The time to beat is 1:15. Time to beat is one minute, Here they come! MEREDITH: Go, go, go! Guys. What is going on? Nothing. Guys, timer's still going. That's my stopwatch. Here you go. All done. Great. JIM: Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunchtime, so, about as productive as any other day, if not more so. RYAN: I figured I could throw it away now or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paperclips and an old yogurt lid? Hey. I have 59 voicemails. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me, instead? Sure. Okay, today, 5:00, closing ceremonies. Really? Notify the athletes. Cool. Michael? Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going on? Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo. Oh, thanks, thanks. It's very cool. It's three bedroom, gay-friendly. Nice. You know. Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you. Really? What's this? These are the closing ceremonies. Step up. Here, on the top one. Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo, so gold medal. (ALL CLAPPING) I don't really know what to say. I'm not one for making speeches, but my heart is very full at this moment. And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal. Get on up here, Dwight. Silver medal. Yeah, not as good as gold. (THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER PLAYING) Why are you playing the National Anthem? 'Cause your condo's in America. What the hell is that? Those are the doves. (MAN WHOOPING) MAN: All right.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker. Katy and Jim met in the office. PAM: And now, I guess they're, like, going out or dating or something. And I don't know, you know. They're just She calls him, and they You know. I'm sorry, I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud? So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye. Hey, you can just give her your extension. Okay. HowardlRyan. Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months, and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think. The temp agency wants to know what you think. Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, "Proficiency in necessary skills. "Excellent." (LAUGHING) DWIGHT: Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years. Five years from now, what do you wanna do? Where do you wanna be? Well, I'm interested in business. Oh. Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Wanna be a manager? No, actually, what I want is to own my own company. That is ridiculous. Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one. (IMITATING YODA) "Much advice you seek." Do you know who that is? Fozzie Bear? Hmm. No. That was Yoda. There are 10 rules of business that you need to learn. Number one: You need to play to win, but you also have to win to play. Got it. And I will give you the rest of the 10 at lunch. Hey. (DOOR CLOSING) DWIGHT: Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger and Tonto and Bonto. (FIRE ALARM RINGING) People! Okay, everybody! This is not a test. Move to the exits. Devon, head towards the exit. Do not panic! Get up off your desks. OSCAR: No, I don't wanna hear it. All right? Let's go, people! No panic is warranted. Do not panic! Go in a single-file line. This is not a drill! Arms at your side! Arms at your side! DWIGHT: Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people. Step lively. This whole place is a tinderbox. It is ready to blow. This is not a test. Can you leave? Oh, you say that every time. (SCREAMING) Do you wanna die? Oh, God. Do you wanna die? Out! All right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Stanley, have you ever seen a burn victim? Move to the exits. Come on, your safety partners. Your safety partners. Let's go! Real smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! God! Oh, Kelly! Are you okay? I got you! I'm okay! Cover your nose and mouth. Hey, let go of me! Breathe through your nose. Let go of me! Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings, okay? They'll melt right into your flesh. Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! Stat means now! MICHAEL: Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first, but we do not employ children. We are not a sweatshop, thankfully. And women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I've a lawsuit on my hands. Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. Adapt. React. Readapt. Apt. All right? That's rule number two. Okay, guys, listen up. We need a head count. Okay, we need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where's he? So, what was rule two? Adapt, react, readapt, apt. Okay, well, let's just kind of take it a little slower. Hey, Michael, Ryan needs a number for the count off. Okay, well, "1" is taken. Okay, "2"? No! Oh, sorry. Okay. He can have "14." Marjorie's not here today. MICHAEL: Well, he needs a permanent number, right? No, I don't. Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers. Yeah, okay. Yeah. No, no, no. I got one, I got one. The Three Stooges. DWIGHT: That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers I don't wanna be, like, a guy here, you know? Like, Stanley is the crossword-puzzle guy and Angela has cats. I don't wanna have a thing here. You know, I don't wanna be the "something guy." Okay, you know what? I think I'm gonna be setting the agenda here, okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So, we're gonna be playing "desert island," um (SIREN APPROACHING) "Who would you do" and "Would you rather." "Would you rather." "Would you rather" is our third game. (HORN HONKING) Yeah! Hey, guys. Great response time. Listen up. I got some theories. Okay, there's a Okay, so three books on a desert island, Angela. The Bible. That's one book. You've got two others. A Purpose Driven Life. Nice. Third book. No. Okay, Phyllis. The Da Vinci Code. The Da Vinci Code. I would take The Da Vinci Code, so I could burn The Da Vinci Code. Okay, great. That's gonna keep you warm for, like, seven seconds. Question, is there firewood on the island? I guess. Then I would bring an axe, no books. JIM: No, it has to be a book, Dwight. Fine. Physician's Desk Reference. Nice. Smart. Hollowed out. Inside, water proof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question, did my shoes come off in the plane crash? Rule number four: In business image is everything. Andre Agassi. This car is an investment, right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? Yeah. JIM: Okay, thought people read more books. DVDs. Five movies, what would you bring to the island? Yes, Meredith. Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blonde, Bridges of Madison County. Wow. Legends of the Fall. Wow. Bridges of Madison County. Legally Blonde. These movies are just Well, I kind of like Legally Wait, wait, wait. Pam, no. Do you understand? The game is "desert island movies," not "guilty pleasure movies." Desert island movies are the movies you're gonna watch for the rest of your life. Forever. Unforgivable. I take it back. Unforgivable. I take it back. Good. And, Ghost. But just that one scene. Is this your car, Ryan? Well, sir, I don't Some pretty big books back there. Good shocks. Hello, Mr. Egghead. (LAUGHS) Oh, Stanley Kaplan. I know him. "M" is for Murder, "P" is for That's actually a test-prep book. for Phone. What? That's a test-prep for business school. Oh, thinking about business school? I just got in. I applied. I go at night. Really? So, you think you know a lot about business? No, not yet. Just started. Uh-huh. Yeah. Quiz me. I wouldn't even know where to start. Oh, come on. Come on, egghead, let's do it. DWIGHT: Do it. Quiz me up. All right. Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years? When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant to save up money for school. And then I lost it in a pyramid scheme, but I learned more about business right then and there than business school would ever teach me or Ryan would ever teach me. Is it cheaper to sign a new customer or to keep an existing customer? Keep an existing cust Shut it. Can I just do it, please? It's equal. It is 10 times more expensive to sign a new customer. Okay. Yes, it was a trick question, okay. Look, I mean, he didn't need business school, okay? Michael comes from the school of hard knocks. All right. Okay, Dwight Self-taught. You didn't even go to college. You know what? You don't need to help me here, okay? You know, maybe you should go to business school like Ryan. Then you'd know what you're talking about. DWIGHT: Come on. So I'm studying with the master. Reference. Why don't you go to business You should learn from him, right? Right? Right? Stop it, Dwight. You know what, Dwight? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it, please? Okay. Hey, he's not your five-year-old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company. And you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. Stupid. MICHAEL: I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? Lebron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA, so So, it's not the same thing at all. Look at this stuff. "Market fragments." What is that supposed to be? It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base. You are so smart. You are so effing smart. You should be teaching me. Pam, get us back into it. Okay. JIM: Five movies. Go ahead. Fargo, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused. Oh, definitely in my top five. Yes, in my top three, so suck it. Breakfast Club. What? The Princess Bride and Okay, that's five. No, my all-time favorite! JIM: Pam, play by the rules. PAM: All-time favorite! Play by the rules. Dwight, all-time favorite movie. DWIGHT: The Crow. I became a salesman because of people. I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but, you know, when you're very successful, your co-workers look at you differently. (SIGHING) What do you think? Maybe we should get some air. No, I'm okay. I'm really uncomfortable. All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event, "Who would you do?" Present company excluded? Not necessarily. Pam. Pam. JIM: Um Okay. You know what? Maybe I'll finish explaining the rules. Let me explain it first and then (EVERYBODY HURTS PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) Yeah, so we'll get right You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back. Okay. Dwight. (TURNS UP VOLUME) Dwight! Come one, Dwight, use words. Why didn't I go to business school? Who goes to business school? The temp. He does? Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore. You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself, "I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekend." He doesn't even know that I do that. PAM: You should tell him. Oh, yeah, Pam, right. That's gonna help things. Just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted. Dwight. What? I'm sorry I said that. I didn't Just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway. You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. No, Jim. I'm not gonna quit. Then Ryan wins. Yeah, you're right. Thanks, you guys. I just need some alone time. Okay. All right, buddy. (EVERYBODY HURTS PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) (LAUGHING) Hey. Guys, what's going on? Nothing. Hey. What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit? The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes. Come on, people, you know the rules of the game, now. Hey, gang. What game are we playing here? Okay, it's called, "Who would you do?" Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What Where are we? Where are we here? Roy. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy? Oh, I got it. What's the name of that tight-ass Christian chick. The blonde? My name is Angela. Hey, Angela. Roy, nice to meet you. All right, who's next? Who's next? Who's next? Who's Jim? You're next. Who would you do? Kevin, hands down. Yeah, I mean he's really got that teddy bear thing going on and afterwards we could just watch bowling. Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan, 'cause he is gonna own his own business. You're all gay. Who's next? Who we got? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Who Hey. No, I can talk. I can talk. I can talk. Yeah, it's a great time. Well, I wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside, so Would that make you happy? What's that? If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy? Yeah. I'm on it. Dwight. Hey, Dwight! You can't go back in yet. He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen. What if he dies in the fire, and that's the last thing you ever said to him? I didn't say it to him. I said it about him. Jim? Definitely Jim. Definitely, definitely Jim. Come on, Pam. Come on. What about you, Pam? Oscar's kind of cute. Yeah, I like Oscar. Ooh, Toby. How long does it take to find a cell phone? (SCOFFS) I don't know either. Is there anybody else? (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, where are you? Oh, good. Yeah, we're just here. We're playing "desert island." It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs. Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find. What's your number? I gave it to you in the car. I saw you program it in. You gotta give it to me again. Okay. All right. Now I have it. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Uh I better tell somebody. Excuse me, sir? Dwight! Dwight! Oh, God, man! Why did you go in there? What? Everybody was scared out of their wits, man. Everyone, okay, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven, because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on "oven" instead of timing it for the toaster thing. Oh, wow, okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. That's exactly what I said. Hey, did you miss that day, there, Ryan? DWIGHT: Were you absent? MICHAEL: Toaster Oven 101. DWIGHT: You failed? I'm so sorry. Oh, man. "Hey, I know what'll impress everybody. I'll start a fire." Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans. I have a song, attention everyone, that I wanna sing, that I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning! Ryan started the fire! Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world was turning! Everybody! I can't believe I started the fire. (SCATTING) Marilyn Monroe! Ryan started the fire! Ryan started the fire! It was always burning DWIGHT: Eat it. Yeah, eat it. You have to eat it. KATY: Hey. Hey. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. It's good to see you. Good to see you, too. I'm hungry. Yeah, I am, too. Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over, and I have my answers. What answers? For the "desert island." Oh, right! Right, right, right. Come on, come on. Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. Hi. Desert island, five movies, go. Okay, first, Legally Blonde. (GIGGLING) I forgot what a super-nice girl Katy is. And just good for Jim. They are so cute together. And what an adorable car. Okay, I think the game's over. People are, like, leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you wanna just go to lunch? Okay. Yeah? All right. You wanna drive? Sure. All right. They are so cute. I'm really sorry, Dwight. Answer me this, though. What? Was it worth it? Was it worth it, temp? No. Was it worth it? Really? I'm really sorry, Dwight. The fire guy. The fire guy! Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon Studebaker, Television North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe! Ryan started the fire! Okay, rule five: Safety first, i.e. Don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no-brainer. Oh, look, Ryan is book smart, and I am street smart and book smart. I'll give you the rest of the 10 tomorrow.
Happy Halloween, everyone! Oh, that's great. Hey. Happy Halloween. Jan called. (SIGHS) Okay. I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. (SIGHS) And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Okay. SHERRY: Jan Levinson's office. Hey, Sherry, Michael Scott returning. Oh, she's in a meeting. She just wanted the name of the employee you let go. Well, I'm gonna wait until the end of the day, because the book said it's best to wait until the end of the day. I just need the name of who you're planning to let go. I don't know yet. I will have to call her back. I know she wanted the name. Okay, Sherry? Yeah. If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so that you could still be friends with the person firing you? Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael. Thanks. I'll call her back. I wish I could fire Sherry. Hey, I'm still here. Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. No. Okay. Bye. Hanging up now. I mean, you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's I mean, these are people's lives you're talking about. You wanted me? Yes. Papier-mache? Yes. Yes. Um Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Why did you put it off until Halloween? Because it's very scary stuff. I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little. You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here. So it's a man? No. Or woman. A human life. If you had to guess who it would be based on their job performance and who you think deserves to be fired, who would that be? I just answer the phone. And sometimes you just let it go to voicemail. Your costume is fantastic. I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. PAM: Oh, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't. (SCREECHING) Okay. Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody. What is that? What are you supposed to be? I'm the three-hole punch version of Jim, 'cause you can have me either way, plain white Jim or three-hole punch. That's great. I like it. JIM: Oh? Yeah. Yeah, well, look. What about me? (HISSING) What are What are you? A monk? I'm a Sith lord. Oh, big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me $129. Ass. Hey, you guys excited about the party? It's gonna be fun. Yeah. Yes. Oh, and look at you. Showing your colors. Don't you wish you wore a dress every day. What are you implying? All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all of those spooky decorations that we had, the cobwebs and such? Yeah, I don't know. We put them all up last night. (SIGHS) Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good? Yeah. Good. Oh, yeah, also, about budget stuff Um I'm gonna need you to find, like, a full employee salary plus benefits. Like 50 grand. I'm gonna need you to find 50 grand in the numbers. But we don't keep two sets of books. Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it. (LAUGHS) Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? A soccer ball and cleats. Why is that? Bend It Like Beckham. Oh, like the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer? Yeah, that would be perfect. Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. It'd be funny. I don't really play soccer or anything. Well, I don't really have two heads. So Wait, what are you again? Oh, right. Three-hole punch! Okay, greatest strength. Okay, okay. A dog-like obedience to authority. Nice. But that doesn't sound good. Okay, okay. How about the ultimate team player? Dwight is special. But I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster. Com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Preferably Alaska or India. (WHISPERING) He's a gun nut. (GRUNTING) (WHISPERING) Sticks to his guns. Well, I looked through all the budgets and there is one department Yes. that has three people Yeah. doing the work that could be done by two. This is great. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Who do you think it should be? Jim, definitely. No, Jim brings in money. Phyllis? No. Stanley, Pam, Oscar, Meredith, Kevin, Angela. It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because that has the least effect on morale. One of the warehouse guys. What? There is someone left off that list? Who? Who is he saying? (GASPS) You're right. I didn't even think of him. No, Michael. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. No. No. Not me. Yeah, I could. Not Dwight. I'm not saying that's what he said. I know that's what he said. What? Tell him not Dwight. That is not a very nice thing to say about him. Tell him to stop. Are you kidding? Quiet, you! I agree. He'd land on his feet. Make him be quiet. Those aren't chips and dip. No, I made brownies. (EXCLAIMS) What? I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things. I made brownies. And I made cookies. Same category. (SIGHS) I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes, pennies, walnuts Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Yeah. Just one second. I will transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott. (TELEPHONE RINGS) Wow. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Hmm-hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Hmm-hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute and he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well, then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Stanley, could you come with me, please? No. As Assistant Regional Manager To the? Look, I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry. "You're fired." Get your fingers off my phone. So, how did it go with Stanley? How did he take it? He wouldn't listen to me. Oh, come on. If you wanna fire him, you're gonna have to tell him yourself. I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big baleful eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just Okay, just Cumberland Mills? And how did you get my resume? Oh, no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh, okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. Oh, hey. Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Gotta just Oh. So you got the fax. So why didn't you add it to the resume? What do you mean? Of course, martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me, I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence! Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too, and I will see you there burning. Fine. Oh, wait, so you'll let me know when you've made a decision Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real. Don't take this the wrong way, but you should go for that job. Um It's in Maryland. Yeah. But, I mean, look at the salary, and it's definitely a step up and a challenge. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, maybe Maybe I will. Jim. This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment? Oh, God. I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits, and a better title at Cumberland Mills. Fantastic. And I turned it down. What? That would have solved all my problems. Out of loyalty to this company. Oh, you idiot. Go. So I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially. If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody. But then you wouldn't have me here. Big deal. Oh, it would have worked out so well. Can you get it back? It's in Maryland. You could call. Can you call them? I can't I suppose I No. (YELLING) They never really made me an offer anyway. Why are you torturing me? God. Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's gonna volunteer, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's gonna happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma. (MICHAEL CLEARS THROAT) Can I speak to you a minute? Yes. Michael, I really didn't mean to Help me. I'm sorry? I want you to role-play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it. Oh, you want me to be you. Yes. Okay. I want you to be me and I will be Creed. Oh, are you firing Creed? No, no, no. That's just first thing Came Can't That head We should switch seats in order to Yes, that's a good idea. All right? Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal (SCREAMING) I'm gonna kill myself! Wow. I'm going to kill myself and it's your fault! That's an overreaction. Corporate is really breathing down my neck and they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month Is this you? Are you being you? Or is this Creed? Are you I am This is Creed. Okay. I'm improvising. So just try to keep up. And I'm very angry. Hold that thought. And I want I'm gonna kill you. Michael Scott here. I'm gonna kill you for firing me. Toby. I really have to take this, Creed, so it was really a pleasure working with you, okay? Get off. Get off. No, no. Just get up. Just, just Yeah. (SIGHS) What happened? It wasn't me. Oh, that was, like, crazy, because I was Yeah, I know. Hey, Creed? Could I talk to you for a second? You are great and very ambitious, and I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd want to just spread your wings and fly the coop. What are you telling me? We're gonna have to You want something better. No, I don't. I wanna stay right here. No, you wanna leave. No, I wanna stay here. Now, why are you making this so hard? I think there's a misunderstanding about this. I think you're right. Can I go? No, of course you can't go! We haven't even started this horrible process of Okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're Goodbye. Let's fight it. Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days. What old days? What are you talking about? Did you start the paperwork yet? It's right here on the desk, yeah. You don't have to do this, Michael. I can't, though. Undo it! I can't change anything. This is the way it No. You have the power to undo it. I don't. Okay, just let's not You can undo it. Michael, undo it! Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg. Had to kill it with a shovel, took about an hour. Why do you ask? I have to fire someone today. Okay? Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon. Okay, well, I already picked you and you know that, so, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you. No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're the guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way, Michael. God bless you. You're a fine man. Don't Listen, you will not regret this, either. Devon is terrible. No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good, good. (DOOR OPENS) Devon, could I talk to you for a second? Creed's an idiot. You know that. Well, he No, no, no, no, no, no. You had it right the first time! Well, maybe I did. Exactly, you gotta go with your gut, man. (SIGHS) No, I can't No, I can't go back. I would look like an idiot. That's why I'm being fired? No. So you might not look like an idiot? No, it was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn and cutbacks, and You God, this is unbelievable! I just hope that you and I can remain friends. Devon, wait. Please. What? Look, look. In addition to severance and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's from me. Okay? No hard feelings. Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm gonna be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell. (DOOR SLAMS) What about the Halloween party? Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. I'm sorry for pushing you toward Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out. Come on. JIM: That's just a figure of speech, you know. Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. And who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone? Right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland because it's double the pay and soft-shell crab just happens to be my favorite food. MICHAEL: I love Halloween. You know, it's just But it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween, I came as Janet Jackson's boob. (MICHAEL LAUGHS) It was topical. People got a big kick out of it. The year before that I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky, and before that I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year. (DOORBELL RINGS) KIDS: Trick-or-treat! Hey. How you doing? Wow, you guys look great! I'm a bumble bee. You look great. And you're a princess? A fairy princess. A fairy princess. You're very I'm a lion! You're a lion. Wow. I wanna hear your Oh! Okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Okay! Grab it. Grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
Where is my desk? That is weird. This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional. Okay, well, you're the one who lost the desk. I didn't lose my desk. Hey, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it? Okay, who moved my desk? JIM: I think you should retrace your steps. Okay, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished. Colder. Warmer. A little warmer. There you go. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Cold. Cold. Cold. Back up. (JIM EXCLAIMS) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Warmer. Hot. Red hot. Hot. Very hot. (TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Dwight Schrute. Hi, Dwight. What sort of discounts are we giving on the 20-Ib. White bond? Jim, I've given you this information, like, 20 times. JIM: I know. (TOILET FLUSHING) It's by the ream? Yeah. Ream It is now $9.78, so it's a discount of 7%. Okay, thank you. Got to get back to work. Wash your hands, Kevin. Right. Oh, let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second. Sensei, hello, it's Sempai. Dwight. You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm gonna find it and then I'll call you back. Thanks. Yes, I just had a question Yes, Sensei. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Was that your mom? No, that was my sensei. Oh, I thought it was your mom. I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei. Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool. Assistant Sensei. Okay. I am a practitioner of Goju-Ryu Karate here in Scranton. (SHOUTING) SENSEl: Two! Dwight, snap your kick back. Three! DWIGHT: My sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt. And gave me the duties of a sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a sempai is. But it's equally as respected as a sensei. I don't wanna stay until 7:00 again this year. I don't really have any control over that, Stanley. Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year it all falls on the same Friday. That's today. I call it the perfect storm. (SINGING) I don't wanna work I just wanna bang on this mug all day Did you ask me here for any specific reason? Yes, I did. Here's the dizzle. I have a very top-secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information. Why is that secret? Hello. Oh, God. Busywork. Oh, get away, cretin. PAM: I put stickers, so you know where to sign. Yes, thanks, I know where to sign. It's just that last year you Yeah, well, last year they were out of order, weren't they, Pam? Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at 7:00. So you need to have them signed by then, or much earlier. Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-MS-ing. That's pretty good. Actually I'm sending Ryan on a top-secret mission. Tell her what it is. Updating emergency contacts. Well, is that really a priority? Is it a priority? Oh, I don't know. What if there's a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble? Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't, because we don't have any emergency contact information, because Pam said it wasn't a priority. Think. Think with your head, Pam. Okay, well, she walks out. That's the problem with being a boss, is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you. Catch-22. Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with? Okay, what's your cell? Larissa Halpert. What's her address? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? MICHAEL: (IN SHRILL VOICE) Hey, Ryan! This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland. You mean Neverland? This is Tito. (LAUGHING) What? Calling from Your major and minor lines cross at a ridge. That sucks. You're making this up as you go along, aren't you? I am just following the website. Well, at least I don't have cavities. Yes, you have very nice teeth. Thanks. Who's your emergency contact? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Stacey. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) Pick up! Hello? (IN SHRILL VOICE) This is Mike Tyson. (SNIGGERING) Hey, Dwight? As sempai, do you ever think that there's gonna be a day where humans and robots can peacefully coexist? Impossible. The way they're programmed You're mocking me. No, I'm not. Well, let me offer you a little piece of advice. I am not afraid to make an example out of you. Well, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: Don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. Okay, give that back to me. Okay. Say "please." No. That is not a toy. Please? Please! Good. And it absolutely is a toy. Arigato. Arigato. This is not a toy. This is a message for the entire office. So that everyone can see that I am capable of physically dominating them. And this is more of a ying-yang thing. The "Michael" is all cursives, "Scott" all caps. Left brain, right brain, or duality of man. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) Could you practice on the forms? No women or children, unless provoked. Okay. Roy. Warehouse guy, doesn't count. Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael? Yeah, I don't think that would happen. Because we're friends. Because I would kick his ass. Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so So? I've beat up black belts. Yeah. And how did you know they were black belts? They told me after. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. Is your wife still your contact? Ex-wife. Yeah. Her last name's Becker now. Okay. You don't need to write "Ex." And after that, nobody ever messed with the Damn Rascals ever again. Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way, right? You're a jet? Have you signed the expense reports yet? Yes, in theory I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. All right. I am going to be in my office, if anybody needs me. (EXCLAIMS) Michael! Oh, wow! Sleeper hold! Bedtime for Bonzo. (MICHAEL SHUSHING) (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS) You are the weakest link! (YELLS) I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends. I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments, and that is when it's nice to let them know that you could beat them up. Just hit me, you'll see. I can't, 'cause I just got a manicure, so Oh, queer! Eye Queer Eye, that's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it. Just have Dwight punch you. Oh, yeah. Well, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of 14-year-old girls who could kick his ass. You know a ton of 14-year-old girls? What belt are they? Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented Armageddon No. he cried at the end of it. He did. DWIGHT: Michael, I told you. That was because it was New Year's Eve and it started to snow at exactly midnight. "Bruce Willis, they're gonna leave him on the asteroid." Okay, I'll punch you. Oh, okay, here we go. All right, come on. (EXCLAIMS) (SCREAMS) (GROANING) Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not. Are you okay? Yes. Are you sure you're all right? Yep, yep. Thank you. I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran, killed 20 men, then spent the rest of the war in an Allied prison camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight. Okay, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael. I don't know. (EXCLAIMS) Okay, I'll buy you a bag of chips. French onion? Obviously. Why are you spinning around? Okay. Yes. Take this pen, okay, stab me with it. MICHAEL: Go away. I just have a quick question. I haven't signed them, okay? No, it's not that. I was just wondering, since I'm probably gonna have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late, too, so he can walk me to my car? Come in. Pam, I hate to break this to you, but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough. He's a purple belt, that's really high. Oh, God, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I can murder him. It's just that out there you Oh, is that what they're saying? Yeah, kind of. Okay, all right. Where's Dwight? JIM: Kitchen. Okay. DWIGHT: All right. Here we go. (KELLY EXCLAIMS) Good. Wow, that's actually pretty cool, Dwight. Excellent. Now, watch. Let me take you from behind. What? MICHAEL: Watch out, Kelly, he might sucker punch you. I didn't sucker punch you, Michael. No, really? In case you'd remember, I was defending my honor. Oh, is that it? Like a samurai. Yeah. Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch, which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. DWIGHT: Okay, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go! Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches. Me punching you and you hitting the floor. No, I'd block your first punch Yeah? rendering you ineffective. Oh, really? Yeah. You know what, you're just lucky that we're at work right now. What about, uh, Dwight's dojo? No, they just have classes. No, it's free during the day. It's fine. Look I got the key. Hey, Michael. Hey, Toby. Any word on those time cards? I have an idea. Why don't you leave right now? Why don't you walk away from the room, okay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out car pools. JIM: Well, we're all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so that we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! I'm coming. Fight! Sorry. I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll. No, it's not. I think it is, a guy told me about that. Actually it's a symbol for eternal discipline. Oh. Wow. That is really interesting. What? Your love line I'm just kidding. I can't see anything. Look closer. Oh, okay. One point for me. Tied up. Oh, you're dead. What? What are you gonna do? Bring it, Beesley, bring it. (GRUNTS) Oh, yeah. Good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now, huh? (LAUGHING) Hey, put me down. Put me down! Oh, my God! Hey, put me down! Hey! IRA: Okay, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins, all right? Yes, Sensei. Lot of rules, lot of rules. On the street, we didn't have any rules. Maybe one. No kicks to the groin, home for dinner. (EXCLAIMS) Hey, what the hell was that? Yes! IRA: Dwight, one point. No way! Okay! Eat it! All right, that's the way you wanna do it? You wanna play dirty, huh? Okay, game on, man! Sweep the leg. MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm coming at you, man! (BREATHING QUICKLY) (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS) Okay, purple belt, okay. I got it. No. I got his pants. That was my pants. No points for pants. Dwight, you have No, look. No, you have something, you have some God, you look like such an idiot! (BOTH SHOUTING) Clean technique, gentlemen. Come on, do that again! Do that again, I dare you. (SCREAMING) Okay, break. Break! No holding! Break. Oh, you can't see! You can't see! One point, two points, three points! IRA: Break! How many points was that? I win! I win! No, you didn't! No, you Eight points, nine points. (HAWKING) Stop it! No! Come on, Michael! Open your mouth! No, Michael! You talking to me? You talking to me? Raging Bull. Pacino. Oh, I want that footage, I want it. I need it. Oh, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work to Check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This is going to be hilarious. Oh, we're playing phone tag. WOMAN ON PHONE: Seven new messages. First new message. ; MICHAEL: Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein. Next message. ; Hey, Ryan, this is your girlfriend and I'm mad. My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Know what the "F" stands for? Fudge? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Come in. Oh, hey, Karate Kid. The Hilary Swank version. Hi. How are you? I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott. Okay, to what? Just put "The Hospital." Contact number, just put 911. (SCRATCHING) He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, do yourself a favor. Just leave me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middleman. (SCRATCHING) Later, Jim. Later, Kev. Have a good weekend. Yeah, you, too. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah? I have the emergency contacts. Just lay them on a chair. I'll take it from here. So, what you up to this weekend? Hanging out with some friends, probably. Well, if you do anything crazy, give me a shout. Yeah. All right, I will see you Monday. All right. Bye. (SIGHING) Dwight? Michael, did you finish yet? This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute? I'm busy. Well, busier, but I'm making the time. Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday? We wanna go home. Well, you don't even have anybody to go home to, Toby, so The shipping place closes in a half hour. I know, but I have been carrying the load on my back all day. And if everyone would just chip in a little bit, it might help me out. What do you say? Let's gang-bang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight. This is illegal. I don't care. I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? Of course. And I'm happy to say that you passed. So, effective immediately, I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager, to Assistant Regional Manager. Michael, I don't know I know, I know, I know, I know. I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it. I can handle it. I can. I know. Okay. (SIGHS) So, I guess, this will just be my office. No, no, title change only. I'll have Pam send out a memo. No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's just not tell anybody about this right now. Just a formality. Absolutely. But not really. Michael, I have so much to learn from you. Yes, you do. Thank you, Sensei. And, ditto. I told Dwight that there is honor in losing, which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous. But there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better, which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me, and I think I proved that today at the dojo. Typewriter torture! Sensei! Typewriter torture! Stop! Typewriter!
Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I got Michael's lucky tie. No, they're in the conference room. Okay. Wait. Are those Michael's Levi's? Yeah. Who dry-cleans jeans? PAM: Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens, but I can tell you he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started Casual Fridays. I'll take those. Thanks. This is a projection of the county's needs. Wow. Graphs and charts. So Somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today. Thirteen schools, two hospitals JIM: So, this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County, our whole county. And if we get this, they might not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. And years. So when we get to the Radisson, I would like to Oh, I changed it to Chili's. Excuse me? Radisson, it just gives out this vibe. It's like, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson." It's kind of snooty. So You had no right to do that, Michael. Here's the thing. "Chili's is the new golf course. "It's where business happens." Small Businessman Magazine. It said that? It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor. All right. But you will let me run this meeting. (MUMBLING IN AGREEMENT) Power trip. What? She had done a background check on me. She had it printed out. No. Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner. RYAN: That is unbelievable. What's going on? We are doing worst first dates. Oh, my God, I win. Okay, it was a minor league hockey game, he brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me. Okay, that's a joke. No, they had to come back for me. Wait, when was this? Um It was not that long ago. Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting. Okay, let's do this thing. Wish us luck. Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan. Thank you. Kiss ass. Okay, probably going to go late tonight, burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you all could just take off now. Michael, this shouldn't take more than an hour. Well Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour? No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. That's not true, I know how to delegate. And they do more work when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I'm here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up! This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly. Okay. All right, ciao. Adios! So which way is Chili's? I'll drive. No, that's all right. I wanna leave straight from there. It is just a couple blocks away, so Boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you? I know Scranton. At all! All right Have you ever been to Scranton, Jan? (SINGING) If it's a couple of blocks away, we can go together. Okay. MICHAEL: Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead. We should come up with a signal of some sort. Why would we need a signal? Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal What kind of trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael? Well, it could be either of us. You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that. Yes. MICHAEL: Hello? Christian? Yes. I thought that was you. Hi. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould. Just "Jan Levinson." And No Gould? No. Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long? No, not long. Good. Good. Jan, what happened? Michael. Is Gould dead? What Michael, we got divorced, okay? I'm so sorry, excuse me. Wow, you're kidding me. Do you want to talk about it? Michael. Could we have a table for three, please? When did this happen? We're in a meeting. Okay. WAITRESS: This way, please. Christian. All right, after you. Thank you. I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county. Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction and Awesome Blossom? What? I think we should share an Awesome Blossom. What do you say? They are awesome. You want to, Christian? Blossom? Sure. Okay, it's done. Actually, Megan? May we have an Awesome Blossom, please? Extra awesome. Now it is done. So, if you have a Hey, I heard a very, very funny joke the other day. You wanna hear it? Christian, you don't have to listen to this. We can It's okay, I like jokes. Okay. Just the one. Just one joke? Okay. Well, if it's just going to be one, I will think of a different joke. Um Let's see. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me. Okay, you want me to read them? Yes. Okay. "A fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue, "leading an animal behind him when" No, no. Told it, not as good as you think. Pick another one. Okay. "There's a transcript between a naval ship" Okay! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning? Sure. "There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse" (CLOSING DRAWER) Is this real? It is a screenplay starring himself. Agent Michael Scarn. Of the FBI. How long is this? Oh, Pam! Good work! Oh, wait, stop. Drawings. PAM: What is that? Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like. The first guy says, "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn." And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort." And the third guy says, "I got you both beat. "I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe." Oh, no! No! Oh, my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose! Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please? JIM: Do we all have our copy of Threat Level Midnight by Michael Scott? Yeah. Oh, yeah. All right, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions and, Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta-Jones. That's the character's name? Oh, yeah. You guys should not be doing this. Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy. You took something that doesn't belong to you Dwight. brought it in here and made copies of it. Do you want to play the lead role of Agent Michael Scarn? (MICHAEL MIMICKING HUNGRY MONSTER) Hey, that's delicious. I love it. We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so Dunder Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match. Well, we are out to save money. What's the bottom line? (GIBBERING NONSENSICALLY) That's why I wanted a signal between us, so I wouldn't have to just shout nonsense words. That's her fault. Did somebody say, "baby back ribs"? Hmm? Hmm? I don't think Christian has time for that I have time. (MICHAEL TAPPING SPOON RHYTHMICALLY) (SINGING) I want my baby back, baby back, baby back I want my baby back, baby back, baby back I want my baby-back, baby-back, baby-back Chili's baby-back ribs I want my baby-back, baby-back "Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. "Catherine Zeta-Jones enters." "Sir, you have some messages." "Not now!" "They're important." "Okay, what are they?" "The first message is, 'I love you.' That's from me." "Not in a thousand years, Catherine, we work together. "And get off my desk." Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of Oklahoma! In the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutie the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good. "If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang." "Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight." DWIGHT: "Thank you for noticing. "Now, keep me company for one more mission." (WHISPERING) Hey, I have to work late. RYAN: "But as soon as I blow out these candles" You're joking, right? JIM: Michael Scarn takes out a 9mm gun and shoots the cake. (IMITATING GUN FIRING) (RYAN LAUGHING) "Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word." Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. "A man, sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, "turns to Michael Scarn." (EXCLAIMS) Oscar? Do you want to play "Golden Face"? (CLEARING THROAT) "Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet." "Yes, perhaps I would, Golden Face. Sam, get my luggage." "I forget it, brother." "Samuel, you are such an idiot. "You are the worst assistant ever and you're disgusting." "Dwigt." Wait, who's Dwigt? PAM: Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie, is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight, but then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace. But that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one "Dwigt." And Dwight figured it out. Oops! D-W-l-G-H-T. Okay, you know what? I am done with this. That's it. The end. JIM: Well, some of us wanna keep reading, if you don't You don't speak for everyone, Jim. Okay, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. And anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now. JIM: That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. Hey, are you hungry? Yeah. Yeah? And so, after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise that I made to her, and take care of her. (EXCLAIMING) Well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or dare. Tell us about your divorce. Oh, no! Michael. Michael. Do. Michael. Michael, please. No. Do, right? Really. It's Hey, you say you're not gonna play. She's not playing. She's not playing the game. It isn't fair. We'd been fighting for a while. Check, please. He didn't want kids. I knew that going into it, but he also knew that I did. So I guess I thought that he would change his mind, he thought that I would change mine. You didn't? I was stupid. No, no, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid, right? That's right. You know? You were really brave. I mean, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists. That's true. You said, "World, this is my blood, it's red, just like yours. "So love me." JIM: I had plans to meet a friend tonight, which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer. Wow. For the bugs. Nice. And that's excellent because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich. Yes. Nice. I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner. (WHOOPING) Yeah! Yes! Right down the street? Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on moving. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have. I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges that this county is up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers, they don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business. And then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices. I know. It's bad. It's terrible. It is. You know what? It really is. (SHUSHING) I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me halfway, okay, because they're expecting me to make cuts. Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but you think we could, Jan? So I guess I'll see you in What are you gonna do with your time off? Travel. Yeah. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be really nice. I'm gonna find myself. You have new music? Yeah. Definitely. (MELODIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) See you! Bye! Thanks. Yes! We did it. We got it! I mean, we got it! We nailed it! Nailed it! Come here. Yes! I am really thrilled. Let's go. What? Let's go. Going Okay. Where're we going? Doesn't matter. Going to the go-go. (LAUGHING) Okay. Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan. (BEEPING) Good morning, Pam. Hey. No, nothing happened. I swear. Nothing happened. What? I'm totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell. And neither do I. No, seriously, guys, I'm not (STUTTERING) I don't want to go into it at all. It's off-limits. Fine. I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean, she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm, so Hello, Dwight. Did you do her? Who? Jan Levinson-Gould. No, no. No Gould. Did you do her? This is none of your affair. Because she is your boss And she is your boss. And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all? (WHISPERING) Jan didn't come back for her car last night. (WHISPERING) What? Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta? Oh, I don't know. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, my God. This is Jan's cell. No way. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question, do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. (PHONE RINGING) It's Excuse me. Hello? Hi. Just talking about you. To the camera? No. Uh-huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What? Okay. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. Could you just No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Mmm-hmm. No, no. This is just a fight. This is just the first of many fights we're going to have. Right. No! See, you I don't understand. You want to see other people? Only other people? Why? Okay, I think you're still a little bit drunk. Excuse me. Excuse me? I think you're Yes, why don't you just come back here? We can go to the hotel, have a few drinks. No, I didn't slip you something. Some might even say we had our first date last night. Oh, really? Really. Why might some say that? 'Cause there was dinner by candlelight. Mmm-hmm. Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date. We didn't dance. You're right. We didn't dance. It was more like swaying. But it's still romantic. Swaying isn't dancing. At least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game. I have some faxes to get out. Oh, come on, Pam. I JIM: Okay, we didn't dance. And I was totally joking, anyway. I mean It's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?
You should get one of these. No, thank you. Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts. Done. This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. Sorry. It's all right. Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex. You're not having sex. Plus, improves your reflexes. See, I would have caught that. Okay, you know what, how much is that? It's only 25 bucks. Wow. Okay. (HISSING) Pam, can I see you in my office? PAM: It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were and it ended with him telling me he could bench press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect. Pam, you're trustworthy. Thank you. And a woman. Oh, no. And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. (BEEPING) JAN: Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon. First impressions? Just off the top, I think she'll be here this afternoon. MICHAEL: My boss is coming in today. The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould. Well, no Gould, the Gould has been Divorce. The awkward part is that this is the first time we'll be seeing each other since Well MICHAEL: It was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the "understanding with rugged good looks" office manager. Just, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. We both didn't. I didn't want it. We both didn't want it to continue. It was not professional. When people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual. JAN: I guess I missed you. "I guess I missed you." So she misses me? She missed you. But then she goes on to say, "That will be our only topic of discussion." That doesn't mean anything. Those are just words. I have one idea of what it means. Okay, yeah. What? What? Well, I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this. Oh, great. All right, well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review. Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings for you. Why That's great news. That Why would I not like that? Just 'cause that you work together and it might be awkward. Wow, wow. All right, let's listen to that again. JAN: Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. Oh, hey. Listen, Jim, here's a little tip for your performance review. Okay. Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders. We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders. Oh, yes, we do. No, we don't. Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and then he'll be sure to give you a raise. All right. Well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease. That is so stupid. What if he gives it to you? Then I win. You know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. Okay. I need to stay focused. And I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday, and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go Monday. (SIGHING) Stupid. Wait, wait, one thing. By tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right? Duh! Duh. Today is Thursday, but Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon. Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words. Really? Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again, and this time, really listen to the pauses. God, Stanley. That's freaking brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact. No kidding. It's all about my bonus. Michael and Jan definitely made out. Oh! Maybe more. Oh, also it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that going. Oh, yay! Good work, Stanley. Great performance review! Stanley in the house, everybody! (WHOOPING) Angela, your turn. ANGELA: I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit and I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny. Michael? Yeah? Jan's on the phone for you. Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year. Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. Yeah? JAN: Michael Jan! Hello. To what do I owe this pleasure? I'm returning your many calls. Well, hello to you, too. Yeah, I was just I just wanted to get some closure on what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's. No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch. Well, surely, this review is a formality because of what happened at our meeting in the parking lot of the Chili's. The review is anything but a formality, Michael. And I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior. Been thinking about you. Okay, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior. I don't see how that's unprofessional. Michael? Yeah? Are the cameras in there with you, in your office? No. They are not. Yes, they are. (PHONE CLICKING) (DIAL TONE) That's my girlfriend. I heard they made out and had sex. I heard they just made out. That's it. Well, I heard they made out and had sex. Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved. Romances? Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis, I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Is there any chance that you wrote any of my ideas down in a folder, like an idea folder? Sorry. That's unfortunate. How about the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there. What suggestion box? The suggestion box that I put out. And people could put in suggestions anonymously. Maybe there's prizes. Oh, yeah, I think I remember that from back when I first started. Why don't you find it and then tell people to get their No, never mind. I'll tell them. Hello? Everybody? Yeah, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming very soon and so we're gonna have our weekly suggestion box meeting. So you can all get in your constructive compliments ASAP. Don't you mean constructive criticism? What did I say? You said constructive compliments. That doesn't make any sense. Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions, okay? Hey, Dan, this is Jim. It is about 11:15 and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the 15th, and that is a Saturday. Saturday. So just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Okay, talk to you soon. JAN: Address this when we meet again. Okay. Okay, bye-bye. Would you please tell Michael that I'm here? PAM: Sure. Hi, Jan. How are you? Hi, Michael. I'm good. How are you? Good to see you. Nice to see you. Okay. Okay, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here. Could we please go into your office? Yeah, right after you. Apres vous. (WHISPERING) No calls. I'll get that. Oh, thank you. It's nice to see you. Nice to see you, too, Michael. Really? Not like that. Oh, well You know, Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business. All right. Period. Do we understand each other? Absolutely. I'm a little confused because first it's, like, all kissy-kissy and then it's, like, all regret because, "Oh, I regret that. "But, wait, I'm still gonna call you. "But we're just gonna talk business, "and I may come down there and fire you if you don't do your job." But what were we talking about when we first kissed? Business. So, are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then? No, no, no. I finished all that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like, "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am." But I do say, "Thank you, ma'am." But I'm not like, "Wham bam." Not that there's anything wrong with "wham bam," if it's consensual. We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question? No. This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise. Fine. Are you wearing a new perfume today? How is that a business question? Well, you're wearing it at the office, and It I'm sorry, no offense, but it's really sexy. Please don't smell me, Michael. Hey, Jim. Hey. How's it going? Oh, my God, did you see The Apprentice last night? Of course. It's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it? Can you believe who Trump fired? No, that was unbelievable. Who? Who was it? Who did he fire? You didn't see it? No. I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! Never go out on a Thursday night. What the hell was I thinking? I don't understand (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hold on. Sorry. Yes, Pam. PAM: Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting. I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt. You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here. I did not, not, not use those words. I'd like to sit in on that meeting. Is it happening right now? No, it's in, like, Everyone's waiting in the conference room. Great. Very good. MICHAEL: Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of you don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. So, let's just read some of these suckers, okay? All right. Number one. "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" I thought you read these every week? Well, obviously, this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally. DWIGHT: It happens occasionally. And, so One down! Next suggestion. "We need better outreach for employees fighting depression." Okay. All right, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression. That sounds serious, Michael. Oh, okay. Well, yeah? Who wrote it? Tom? Tom. Then, it is a joke because there's nobody in here named Tom. Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. Tom. Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. All right, next suggestion. Next suggestion. (MICHAEL GIBBERING) "You need to do something about your B.O." "You need to do something about your B.O." Okay. Now, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion. And it's not an office suggestion. Far be it from me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody. Aren't the suggestions meant for you? Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that that is a very poor choice of words. Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring. Was I, Creed? Okay, well, you know what I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs. Because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of, okay? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good. We're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath." Okay, no! "You need to do something" Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight. Okay. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box. Sometimes you talk to us real close. Yeah? Is that hard for you? All right. Well Well, when you have coffee breath it's hard I'll work on that. Okay, let's keep going. DWIGHT: Just keep it going. Yup. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a garbage can. This is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum, okay? I don't want to have to read these tomorrow. Yeah. Who wants to come in on a Saturday? Yeah What? All right. Next suggestion. "Next suggestion." "Don't" Okay, that's blank. Don't Just Put it "Don't sleep with your boss." Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan? I can't I don't understand why you're so upset. I can't All right, please sit down. I'm going to sit over here, you're gonna sit over there. Why are you Let me ask you this. Please sit yourself down. Let me ask you something. What, Michael? Where did you get your outfit? (HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CD PLAYER) You're gonna give me this raise. I deserve this raise. Yes! Yes! Yes! (SCREAMING) The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation. (SHOUTING) Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because I'm awesome! I am awesome! I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened. Because nothing did, Michael. I'm not gonna say anything more about it and I would advise that you do the same. Look Michael. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm interrupting. Oh, God. Were you guys making out? No, Dwight. Come in. Great. What do you want, Dwight? I am ready for my performance review. Okay, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave. Goodbye. Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael? Do you want to talk now? Good. Okay, Dwight, leave. Wait, I would like to discuss my raise. Why on earth would we give you a raise? That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking it. Let me bring up one word. Dedication. I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness, even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays. You do? How do you get in? I have a copy of your key. That's a serious offense. That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart. Oh, Michael, for God's sakes. I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace. Okay, third wheel, why don't you do that? For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. That was deer? Gross. Oh, God! DWIGHT: You liked it. Did not. Jan, have you ever had deer? No. It's a delicacy. And, you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to the Antler Lodge, sample some deer, and talk about my raise. What do you say, Jan? Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about 10 minutes. Okay, you just clear your head. Thank you, Dwight. Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. Do you have a light? And in conclusion, I think Lex Luther said it best when he said, "Dad, you have no idea "what I'm capable of." That's from Superman? Smallville. And that is why I feel I deserve this raise. PAM: Do you think Michael and Jan actually I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam. How do you come back from that? You don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together. No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that as a human being? Yeah. No, I don't think you can. I'm heading back to New York. Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay? Good. No, no, no, come I just want to know why. Michael, now is not the time or the place. Okay, so you're saying that there is a different time or place that we could have this discussion? No. I am saying we are never gonna have this conversation. Well, okay. What? Never? As in never, ever, ever? Or never as in there's still a chance? Never for me always means never, ever, ever. I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio? You know, Michael Am I too short? Michael, it has nothing to do with your looks, okay? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way. And I don't agree about the B.O., but you are very, very inconsiderate. Really? Really. You're You're a great guy, okay? I appreciate that, thank you. And you were very sweet. And you stayed up with me and talked to me and cried with me, and I appreciate that. No, I didn't. I was I don't cry. But I just am not in a place right now where I'm looking for a relationship. So, we can still work together, we can still be friends, but (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) Okay? So my looks have nothing to do with it? Oh, God. Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now, and it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed. I'm good. I can go home now. (PHONE RINGING) Hey, it's 12:20. Where the hell's Dwight? No idea. "Never missed a day," my ass. I'm here! I'm here! I'm here. It's okay!
It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. (GASPS) Oh, my God! Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. We have a serious problem here. All right everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here. Are we in danger? There's no time to think about it, this is real. Just Everybody (KNOCKING ON DOOR) KEVIN: Michael, should I call the What? The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start. Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but you guys have these things so password protected That just means you have to enter your password. What's your password, Michael? Uh That's Yes. (YELLING) Michael Sorry. Please don't do that. Okay, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing? I can't tell you. You have to tell me. I don't have to tell you anything. Look, Michael, (SIGHING) I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over. Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, okay? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm I'm not going to get or hit by a car Stop. or a bus or a train. You could get poisoned, fall down a well, step on a mine, choke. I'm not Okay, if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, okay? Why don't you just go away? There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed. And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails. So how do you search? By keyword phrase. Try "profits." No, try "Michael Scott." "Michael," "boss" and "funny." Oh, my God. Wow! E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, terribly nice guy. "Sorry I didn't write back sooner. "I can't go to the game tonight because my boss, Michael, "is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers. Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers? Oh, no! Everybody, Oscar's gone crazy. What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? I will destroy everything in my path. OSCAR: Actually, we just (MIMICKING ROBOTIC SOUNDS) Actually Okay. Oil can. Oil can. Tin Man. Actually, we just got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance. What? No, that defeats the whole purpose. So it's true? You have access to our e-mails? You know what the problem is? I think I do. The problem is that when people hear the term "Big Brother," they immediately think it's scary or bad. But I don't. I think, "Wow, I love my big brother." I gotta erase a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff. Oh, hey. Just so you know, if you have any sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately. I know. Good. Hey! Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to delete all of her sensitive e-mails immediately. What? I know. Do you think that they're, like No. Right. No, no. (HUMMING) (EXCLAIMING DISGUSTEDLY) Maybe. It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's going to be really gross, but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. So if you guys see anything Hey, Dwight? My friend is kind of into these two girls that he works with. Nice. One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short and blond and perky and kind of judgmental. Who do you think he should choose? Does he have access to their medical records? Um I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we're downriver from that old bread factory. MICHAEL: Meredith has an evite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my evitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be No. Hey, Angela. How's it going? Hey. It's okay. Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight? No. Are we supposed to? No. I mean, I don't know. I don't think so. Excuse me. There is always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly. It's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I'm very approachable as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler. (CHATTERING) Are you going to eat with us? Of course. Hanging with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hanging with my cup of noodles. This is a meal in a cup. Right here. Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. (GRUNTING APPRECIATIVELY) You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody would go, the athletes, the nerds, professors. The professors would go to the parties? Yeah. They were the most fun. We always invited them. JIM: It's true, I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, karaoke machine and I didn't invite Michael. So, three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal. I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, you know, have fun. And my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because, I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm making Dwight up. He is very real. What? Oh, yes! Thank you. Question. On the Internet, there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight, and I was wondering Could you keep that down? Why? (WHISPERING) Because not everybody knows about the party. (WHISPERING) Like who? Who doesn't know? Michael. Why just Michael? Because it's a surprise. Is it? Oh, that's perfect. So don't tell. I won't. Okay. So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael. Really? That's great. I know. Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere. Oh, man. Oh, you know, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on numbers for food and stuff, so do you think Roy's gonna come, or Oh, no, he can't make it. Okay, cool. Hey, there. Hey. Almost quitting time. Yep, it's 4:00. One more hour to take care of anything you forgot to do. (CLEARING THROAT) Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if you don't, we could hang out. Oh, um I can't. You have plans? Yeah, I do. Yeah? I do, too. I do, too. You do? Big plans. I do. Yeah. Because you just said you wanted Tonight? I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class. I have improv class. Hanging out with my improv buds. Really? Yeah. That sounds like a lot of fun. Oh, it's the best. It is the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go. Improv sounds great. It is. Okay. All right. (MAN COUGHING) What? I think Stanley just coughed. Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk you to your vehicular transport? No, thanks. All right. Oscar, got big plans tonight I'm on a call. Okay. Kevin. Big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to? My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival Okay, all right. Hey, Angela. Rushie, rushie! Where're you rushing off to? I'm just leaving for the day. Yeah, well, duh! Where're you headed? Charity bake drive. Liar! You are a liar. No. No, I'm not! (SIGHING) Dwight! Oh, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hanging tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch? That stupid Battleship Galaxy. Battlestar Galactica. That's Whatever stupid show you want to watch, we're watching it. I can't tonight. Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice. I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight. Clarinet. You, too, Dwight? Have fun tonight, whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. (WHISPERING) He has no idea. Quick announcement, everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen and there is beer available on the porch. And despite what you might think it's not all for Meredith and Kelly. So please enjoy. Jim. You really think this is a good idea? A hide-a-key rock? Hey, you must be Dwight. You don't work with us. That's because Mark's my roommate. Hey, I love the Birkenstocks. Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car for special occasions. (WHISPERING) Jim, come here. When is the guest of honor coming? Oh, laterish. He's gonna love it. Great. Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised. Hey. Hey. Just in time. Do you wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave. Definitely. Well, the group tour is now leaving then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we're going to be pointing out to you today. You will be able to see both bedrooms and if we're lucky, maybe you get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows? I have to remind you also that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to. Hey, is Katie coming? Actually, I haven't talked to her in a while. It's off? Is it cool if I call her? We can talk about that later. Okay, let's get right into it. I need two people for the first scene. (EXCLAIMING) Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter! Okay, Michael and Anybody? How about Mary-Beth? Okay. Come on. Okay, so you start us off, Mary-Beth. All right. Great. Okay. (SINGING) Detective Michael Scarn! I'm with the FBI! Think about this. What is the most exciting thing that can happen on TV or in movies or in real life? Somebody has a gun. That's why I always start with a gun. Because you can't top it. You just can't. I'm supposed to meet my doctor here. Have you seen him? He's a very angry midget. Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI! You know what you did. (IMITATING GUN FIRING) Yeah, you thought you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't you? Well, you didn't, because I know where you hid the diamonds. I've been onto you and your little friends for weeks. Boom! Boom! Boom! I'm not even in the scene! Boom! Boom! Boom! Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay. You shot me, okay, great. Stop. Okay. What? Why? You can't just shoot everyone in the scene. Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene you would have seen where it was going. Okay, what about the scene they set up? Boring. No, it wasn't. No more guns. It could've No, no, Michael. Why don't you give me all the guns you have? Just get rid of all your guns and give them to me. Great. Okay. Jim's bedroom. See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's Cool. This is your desk? This is my desk. Your home office? Home office. This is it. Yeah. You have to sit down, so I can get the full effect. Okay, sure. Will do. Okay, wait. So that would make me, like, right here. Yeah, yeah, that feels about right. And then, Dwight would be, like You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam, happy thoughts. (GASPS) Yearbook. Yeah, you don't have to All right. Yes, that's not going to be awkward at all. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. You were so dorky. Thank you. CHRIS: Freeze. I'm in. Do you want to go over the rules one more time? No, no, no, no! I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune. I promise it's worth it. I can see you walking out of here and you're thrilled with your reading. What are you Michael, what did you tell him? Nothing. Then why are his hands up? Bill? He told me he couldn't show it to me, but he has a gun. (SIGHING) Okay, let's call it a day. Nice job. Good. That was good. Good work, everybody! Angela! Burger? Dog? Having fun? I got sap on me. Chicken, hotdog, burger. I'm a vegetarian. There is soda inside. I didn't think the premium laser color-copy batch would sell as well as it did. It surprised us all. I'll tell you why, because I'm sorry, guys. Can we please not talk about paper? There's gotta be something else that we could talk about. (CLEARING THROAT) ANGELA: I think it's all right. I mean, Jesus drank wine. Hey, Phyllis. Come here for a second. Sure. Have you heard anything about any secret office romances or You tell me. You do mean you and Jim, right? Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I mean, I thought, you guys hang out all the time, and you're talking all the time And I'm sorry. I Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Not so fast, fire guy How do I get to Bernie's Tavern from here? Don't worry, we're all gonna carpool. To Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's? Sorry, we're not going as a group. It's just a private friend who happens to know all of us from different ways, is throwing a private birthday thing. Right, right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but you know what? I have an office party. Big office party I need to go to. Can't get out of it. Hey, see you later. Good job. Nice job, Bill. Not. (SINGING ALONG WITH KARAOKE) Here I go again on my own Going down the only road I've ever known Oh, hey, how's your little side project going? Oh, yeah, I gave that up. Really? Yeah, it turns out I was just grasping at straws. Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together. You know, like, people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair of us to assume that there was anything else going on. (SINGING) Just turn around now 'Cause you're not welcome anymore and I got all my Surprise! Everybody! Wow. Who opened the morgue for this thing? I was just driving by, I thought I'd drop in. There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're going to open it. Hello, temp, take my jacket. (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Oh, come on, that guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it. I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs, I got next. I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started! Okay, where is that wine? Okay, this is a duet, so, (ISLANDS IN THE STREAM PLAYING) I need somebody else. Pam, you wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. (SINGING) Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown Kelly? I tried to get you with a fine-tooth comb I was soft inside There was something going on This is the part, it goes to the girl. (HIGH-PITCHED TONE) You do something to me that I can't explain Hold me closer and I feel no pain Every beat of my heart We got something going on Tender love is blind It requires a dedication All this love we feel needs no conversation Divided together Making love with each other MICHAEL: We're making love! Islands in the stream that is what we are No one in between How can we be wrong Sail away with me Talk! Just talk! I Shut up! Funny story. The way I got into improv was I got into improv The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says, "Hey you're funny. You're the funniest guy I've ever seen, "or my name is not Dale Earnhardt." And that was an improv. The real way was that I found a flier.
DWIGHT: Go. Get the door. MICHAEL: Here we are. DWIGHT: Go. Push. Oh, God. DWIGHT: Push. No, no, no. Turn it around. Really shove it. You'll break it. Shove it through. Break it! MICHAEL: You shove it. Shove it back. MICHAEL: Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight. All right. I got a splinter. Well, suck it up. We all have problems. (DWIGHT PANTING) Hey, everybody. Look what we have. (MICHAEL LAUGHING) MICHAEL: Nice, huh? (GRUNTING) I've got it leveraged. DWIGHT: Push. Straight up. MICHAEL: On three. Ready? Big. One, two, three. DWIGHT: One, two, three. (MICHAEL GRUNTING) Merry Christmas. Did it work? Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big? A, that's what she said, and, B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year. But what are we gonna do with this hacked-off part? Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin, and we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about. So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa, and I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also gonna stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else? This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel. Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights? Yes, I got those cute little ones. Do you think I should have gotten the big ones? We'll see. RYAN: Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster, which to me seems excessive. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, pimp. (LAUGHING) I'm kidding. What do we got? What do we got? How many plates are we getting? Fifty. Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me. MICHAEL: It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus, 3,000 Gs. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that. I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to know and spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive. You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party. Yeah. I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody. One. Two. Three. (GRUNTING) You guys should use a hand truck. Do we have one? No. Will you help me? No! No way. It No. Come on, Mike. Let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours. You wanna be Santa? Yeah. Have you ever seen Santa? Yeah, I've seen Santa. Okay. Who cares? Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work. Michael, I would like to be the elf. That makes sense because he has elfish features. DWIGHT: Okay, everyone. Listen up. It is time to get your presents, wrap them and place them under the tree, like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes, you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael. I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that. I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I I got him this shamrock keychain. I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't. You get something good this year? I think I did a pretty good job. Yeah? Who did you have? Well, I can't tell you, 'cause it's a secret. I think I got something pretty nice for my guy. Yeah? I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow. Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sort of went above and beyond. That's great. Well, don't tell me who it is, 'cause I can It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan. Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no. I'm gonna handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons. I know how to plug something in. I want to do it. All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. MICHAEL: Ready? Three, two, one. ALL: Three, two, one. (ALL CHEERING) MICHAEL: Not great. I'm sorry, everybody. I think the tree looks nice. Hey, I could get some flares from my car. No. No. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa. Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It is like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars' worth." First present, Oscar. Shower radio. Neat. Oh, good, that was from me. Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim. Oh, cool. That's from me. Great. Where did you get it? I don't know. It was so long ago. He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went into his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in a bag. Yep. That's exactly what happened. DWIGHT: Pam. Oh, my God! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome. There's a little more to it. DWIGHT: All right. Next. Ryan. No. Don't. Whoa, a video iPod. Whoa. Wow. Jeez. MICHAEL: Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me. I got carried away with the spirit. Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks. You don't know that. Yeah, you left the price tag on. I did? Yeah. What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right? Michael. Oh, hey, for me. What is in here? Oh, come on. I knitted it for you. An oven mitt? Okay. So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey, Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year "but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." I gave Ryan an iPod. Should we just keep opening up the presents? We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions. I got it. We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap. What is Yankee Swap? One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal someone else's gift or choose a new gift. I thought that was called Nasty Christmas. Yeah, we call it White Elephant. Well, I call it fun! Why are we doing this? Because it's better. Because it's more special. It sounds mean. Shut it. No, it's not Okay, just give it a shot. Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt. I'll take the teapot. Oh. Shouldn't we I bought that specifically for Pam. Yankee Swap! MICHAEL: That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now. I'll take the iPod. And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice? Yes. Now, you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift. That was meant for Kelly. Yeah, I figured. I think this is going great. Yikes. Well, it's for Angela, so That's, like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen. DWIGHT: Angela, you're up. I'll take the poster. Some people like these. I will steal the iPod. MICHAEL: Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle. Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn. I'll take the teapot. Damn it. Okay. Moving along, Meredith, let's go. I really want the iPod. (EXCLAIMING) It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else. I hope nobody takes this baby, 'cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful. I'll take the oven mitt. Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology. Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm. "In addition to these paint ball pellets, "your gift includes two paint ball lessons with Dwight Shrute." You and me, Michael. Yes. Who wants to take paint ball lessons? How is that better than an iPod? I never said it was better than an iPod. Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paint ball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand. Take that, Saddam. Last gift, Kevin. I want the foot bath. KEVIN: That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot. Pam, steal something or pick the final gift. I want the iPod. KELLY: Damn it. Sure you don't want the teapot? Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But Right. Sorry, I No. No. Definitely. It's Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories. Yes! There you go. I want the tea pot. Gracias. Got to be kidding me. Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets Christmas. What is she so upset about? Maybe because you hated her present so much. Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit. I think it was a success, and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paint ball pellets. Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people. And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else. Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me! You got a bonus check? How much? It wasn't It wasn't that much. It was $3,000. All right, I'm done now. MICHAEL: Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people, and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame. LIQUOR STORE WORKER: It comes to $166.41. All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered? Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it. Cool, cool. Box it up. (WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS PLAYING ON STEREO) I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it? No trades. Come on. It's a shamrock keychain. Good luck. "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane, Titanic. Look it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you? No. I want it. I'm going to use it. You don't even drink tea. True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems Okay. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. To think that my gift to Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle. ROY: This is awesome. I know. It's totally gonna change the way I work out. Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money. So what are you gonna get me instead? I don't know. Probably, like, a sweater or something. Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty. (MICHAEL LAUGHING) What is that? This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze. We can drink? We're really not supposed to serve alcohol. Zip it, Toby! Just I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink? Me. Please. MICHAEL: Go! Here we go! The deal is that this is my last hurrah, 'cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not gonna drink anymore during the week. Hi, guys. RYAN: Hey. Does everyone know my boyfriend, Bob Vance? Kevin Malone. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Stanley Hudson. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Ryan Howard. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. What line of work you in, Bob? I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O. It was over, man. Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games, or else I'm done. ROY: It's possible. ROY: I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man. DARRYL: I had to, I needed defense. ROY: Come on! Shaun Alexander? ROY: He's the best back in the league. DARRYL: It's defense. ROY: Oh, no. That's not worth it. DARRYL: It is worth it. ROY: Never. DARRYL: Are you kidding? You wait. Anybody making out in here? Not yet. Give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. Okay, how's it going in here? We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some? Yeah, there should be some No, no, no. We'll find some. Don't leave the party. ALL: One, two, three! (DISCO MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee. Oh, no. MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really did not do anything. MICHAEL: Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend. You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know. No, I was just checking out my present. But I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside. Oh, my God! The yearbook picture. Yeah, I think I made the right choice. Oh, my God! It's incredible. Is this the bottle timer? I didn't think you were gonna get that one. I really didn't. (PAM LAUGHING) (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) This is so awesome. Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to. Thank you. You're welcome. Merry Christmas, asswipe. No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen. (IMITATING RAPPER) What's up, my nerds? Check it out! Oh, no, no. Oh, look at that. Icing on the cake. Pacman need a drinky. Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up Toby? Toby's gonna fix you up. Yeah. Darryl. There you go. You earned it. That's okay, Mike. No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it. All right. Thanks, man. Hey, Merry Christmas. Whose butt is that? Mine. Oh, how did I not guess that? Lampshade on head! It's happening! CREED: Oh, no. Hey. Oh, hello there. But what are you doing? I don't know. You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that. (SCREAMING ANGRILY) Thanks for the party, Michael. MEREDITH: Yeah. MICHAEL: Oh, hey Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in? I'm in. Yes. OSCAR: Michael? Poor Richard's? Yeah. That sounds good. Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time. Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's? Yep. Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat? Yeah. Okay!
Hey. Hello. Jim! What's up, buddy? This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here? JIM: That's weird. A dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good. Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, 'cause you're friends with the vending machine guy. Who, Steve? Yeah, Steve. Whatever his name is. What do I want? What do I want? (EXCLAIMS) It's a pencil cup. Oh, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup. I don't think so, I just bought it. I think so, and you're gonna hand it over to me. I love these. Okay, fine. Where's my wallet? There it is. J1. Here, you know what? I don't have any I've got some nickels. $0.05, $0.10, $0.15, $0.20, $0.25 Hello, everyone. Good morning, Michael. Where are we going this afternoon? (EXCLAIMING) Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo. "It's time for our first-quarter camaraderie event. "So pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes and a ski mask." A ski mask and a swimsuit. So that he can have us rob a bank and then escape through the sewers. And brush our teeth. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Michael. Stanley, bo-banley. I need to know Banana-fana-fo-fanley. what we're doing. Me, my, mo, manly. You said bring a toothbrush. Stanley. Is this an overnight? Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it? Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow? Maybe. I don't know. Not maybe. Yes or no? Well, no, but Okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack. In January? It's cheaper. This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience. It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. Yes! It's a booze cruise. All right! I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that? No, this is mandatory. But don't worry. You know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan. I'm already in business school. Well, this KELLY: Wait, Michael. Yeah? Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit? To throw you off the scent. Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit. Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it. I took the tags off already. Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just We're not gonna pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking. "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda something, and she is from Corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say. I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year and It wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course. Leader ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership" as its derivation. So if this office is in fact a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork! Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the competition." So guess where we went. Now, on this ship that is the office, what is the sales department? Anyone? How about the sales department is the sails? Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace. A furnace? How old is this ship? How about the anchor? PHYLLIS: What does the furnace do? All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. It's just It's the sales I see the sales department are down there. They're in the engine room, and they're shoveling coal into the furnace. Right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands. Not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right? Titanic. I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October. No! I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on! Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck. Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned. No. Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. You They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty. And they're singing their ethnic songs and Actually, that might be warehouse. What? The No, no No, I didn't Okay. Well, the Okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is "leadership." We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship. Aye-aye, Captain. (MICHAEL SINGING) A three hour tour A three hour tour MICHAEL: Pam, you are Mary Ann. We have the Professor and Ginger. Welcome aboard! Angela, you are Mrs. Howell, Lovey. The native. Sometimes they come from neighboring We have one of the Globetrotters. I am the Skipper, and, Dwight, you will be Gilligan! Cool! Actually, I'm the skipper. Okay. But you could be Gilligan. No! I'd rather die. Hi. I am Michael Scott. I am the captain of this party. (EXCLAIMS) I'm Captain Jack. I'm captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on this ship. Hi, welcome aboard. Okay. In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulous. Hey, look! I'm king of the world! (MICHAEL WHOOPING) (DWIGHT WHOOPING) (CAPTAIN JACK CLAPPING) CAPTAIN JACK: Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack. And I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome! Okay, so Okay, so Please. The life preservers Right. they are located underneath the seats all along the perimeter of the boat. Don't worry, you are not gonna be needing life preservers tonight. Well, we might be. It's just gonna be Please let me finish. Okay? Thank you. Well So the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. Now, on this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. (LAUGHING) Not only am I your ship's captain, I am also your party captain! (WHOOPING) We're gonna get it going here in just a few minutes. And I'm your party captain, too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! Hey, Mike, Mike, Mike. So we are gonna If you don't mind rock it! What? Please! Okay? If the boat's rocking, don't come knocking! Michael. Yeah? Your company employees are not the only people on the boat tonight. Okay? We're all gonna have a good time tonight. Hey, listen, listen, Mike. Why don't you let me and my crew do our job? You just sit back and have a good time. Okay. Yep. So All right? You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. (LAUGHING) Right? Yeah. Pam, were you a cheerleader? No, she was total "Miss Artsy-Fartsy" in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything. That's hilarious. It's not hilarious Where did you go to school? Bishop O'Hare. His-slop-who-cares-a? We played you! You really look familiar. Did you You cheered for them, didn't you? No. Yes, I did. (SINGING) A-W-E-S-O-M-E Awesome, awesome is what we are We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E ROY: I remember that, and we crushed you, like, 42-10. Having fun? Yeah. Everybody's really nice. Good, well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yorkers! So When are you gonna start the presentation? I already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing. So, right now, I was thinking. Yes, okay! Listen up, all you Dunder Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support. Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo! (DWIGHT WHOOPING) So, okay. All right, I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick! Who's it gonna be? Okay. Me, me, me. Usually it's a woman. I'm stronger. Hey, I got an idea. How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight? Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you. I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four and I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats. (BAND PLAYING PEPPY MUSIC) (PEOPLE CHEERING) All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest! Why don't we do that after I do my presentation? Nope. Dance contest! All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! (BAND PLAYING DANCE MUSIC) Yeah! Okay! Dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body! And communicate! Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss dancing. (SINGING) What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor Early in the morning? Come inside and talk to me. I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman? Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot! Yeah! Who's next? Come on! Pammy, come on! Come on! No, I'm not doing that. Come on! (ALL CHATTERING) Hey, why don't we find, like, a quieter place to hang out? No, I just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on. Darryl! Darryl! It's getting kind of rowdy down there. Yeah. (LAUGHING) "Darryl, Darryl, Darryl!" Sometimes I just don't get Roy. I mean, I don't know. So What's it like dating a cheerleader? (PAM CHUCKLING) I'm cold. So, what's this presentation all about? See? This is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save? Women and children. No, no, salesmen and profit centers. That's a stupid analogy. Okay. Well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership. Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone coastal patrol boat during Desert Storm. Wow, you should be the motivational speaker. Him? Okay. Yeah, he gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour. I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off? (LAUGHS) I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So you don't want to ask my advice. Suppose your office building's on fire, Jim, who would you save? Let's see The customer, because the customer is king. Not what I was looking for, but a good thought. He's just sucking up. When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, and I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her. You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up. ROY: Everybody, could I get your attention for just a second? Can you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important and Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. (ALL CHEERING) How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, baby! MAN 1: Yeah! Congratulations! Congratulations! MAN 2: Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my God! I love you, baby! Congratulations! (PEOPLE CHEERING) You know what, I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you? No, it's Captain Jack. Well Captain Jack. Could have been either one of us, because we pretty much were saying the same thing. Congratulations! That is great! We gotta celebrate! ALL: Yeah! (SCREAMING) CAPTAIN JACK: Hey, hey, hey! I got an idea, I got an idea. I could marry you right now as captain of the ship. MAN: Yes! I could marry you as Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin! No, no, no. I want my mom and dad to be there. Then I'll give you away! No, thank you. (BAND PLAYING SOFT MUSIC) Do you think that'll ever be us? No. What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight? I don't know. Let's break up. What? This is where old Captain Jack drives the boat. Wow! (MEREDITH LAUGHS) Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the moon. Captain Jack's a fart-face. (RETCHING) I'm on medication. Really? What? Vomacillin. (CLEARING THROAT) Okay, all right. It's time to be boss. Time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, guys. Cool it. Everybody? Dunder Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I've some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody. Right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking. Okay? We're going down right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake, and there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat. Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary It's a predicament. Hey! What the hell is going on here? And it's something that each and every one of us have to think about. I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What is the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was If he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now, and not all wet. (SIGHING) Is somebody there? What happened to you? (SIGHING) Captain Jack has a problem with authority. Right, 'cause you announced that his ship was sinking? Yeah. He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic. What a night. Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged. She was always engaged. Roy said the first one didn't count. That's great. You know, to tell you the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam. So Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow! I would have never put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know I made out with Jan. Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah. Well, Pam is cute. Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm, and she's just Anyway. Well, if you like her so much, don't give up. She's engaged. BFD. Engaged ain't married. Never, ever, ever give up. DWIGHT: Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore. It's a fake wheel, dummy.
Well, Lords of the Ring trilogy, if you see it back to back, Yeah. it's really long, but it's good. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Pam, it's Michael. Help me. I need help right now! Michael, what's wrong? I'm hurt. I have hurt myself. (GROANING) Oh, my God! Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait! Oh, this is not looking good, Pam. Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance? No! I want you to pick me up. Okay. What's going on? Wait a sec. I thought you said that you were hurt. I am hurt. I hurt my foot. I'm sorry. Pam, what is going on? I want to come to work, but I need you to come and pick me up. (ON SPEAKER PHONE) Oh, God! Hey, whoa, Michael. Oh, God! It's Okay. It's Jim. Just say again really loudly what happened. Okay, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman grill and I now need someone to come and bring me in to work. You burned your foot on a Foreman grill? I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon. Sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman grill. Then go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's a perfect way to start the day. Today, I got up, I stepped onto the grill, and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that. MICHAEL: Pam, could you come get me? (HESITATING) I have to stay here and answer the phone. Okay, could someone come and get me, please? Ryan? Michael, you should stay home and rest. There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan Tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell him that? Can you hop? I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall, and now my elbow has a protuberance. No one wants to pick me up? DWIGHT: What is going on? What is going on? Michael is sick and he wants one of us to rescue him. I'm not sick! I'm I'm coming, Michael! I'm gonna save you! Don't! Is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight. Okay! Hold on, Michael, I am coming! Wait there! I don't want Dwight! Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend. But you said you went out with her this weekend. That was all made up. Just someone come, okay? Anyone. Anyone, but Dwight. (CRASHING) What was that? What was that? (PAM AND JIM EXCLAIMING) JIM: He hit the pole. It's broken, right? He can't Oh, my gosh. Oh, Dwight. Dwight. (PAM AND JIM EXCLAIMING) Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. Is he okay? He's still driving. JIM: Dwight, you forgot your bumper. MICHAEL: Hello? Please don't send Dwight. Morning, everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover. God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through. You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate. Oh, did you explain why? No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot. Burned my foot, Pam. Please stop popping my cast. Thank you. So where are you shipping your foot? (LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY) So, where are you shipping Your foot. MICHAEL: Thank you. Pam, messages, please. You didn't have any. Really? Well, it seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and Do my job? No. Your job is being my friend, Pam. Ow! God! It slipped. What Sorry. It's just that before, you said you didn't want any special treatment. I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would a family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask. Do you want some aspirin? Because you seem a little fussy. No, I don't want some aspirin. Yeah, I am fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot. Pam, I am Assistant Regional Manager and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to (MICHAEL SIGHING) What? Part of your duties are to what? What? You just said that part of your duties are to Something. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Where is my corn bread? Here you go. Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like? Yes, I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat. Where are the yams? They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach. Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg? Yes. And they had no yams? They had no yams. How strange. Because they always have yams. Oh, man, is that a Prism DuroSport? You've seen one of these? Yeah. They're like an iPod, only they're better, because they're chunkier and more solid. Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it. Oh, no, no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents apiece. Really? Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. Kidding. Oh. Why would they all be Okay, see you later, Pan. Pan? Pam. Pam? (SIGHING) Oh, God. (PHONE RINGING) What? Come here, please. Tell me before I come there.

Oh, no. It's broken. What? No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long. That is so cool. Thanks, Dwight. You're welcome. So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now. Oh, God, no. Dwight isn't my friend. Oh, my God. Dwight's kind of my friend. No, no. No one is helping me out at all, Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry, drive down here and make a big thing. Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you? You like candy? It's all right. 'Cause you're sweeter than candy. What is wrong with you? Wow, you just dive right in. You know, around age 12, I just started going for it, you know. (THUDDING) MICHAEL: Help! (MICHAEL GROANING) Oh, God! Oh, help! Help me. What happened? I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall. What do you need? Not you. Someone else. Get Pam. I don't think Pam's gonna wanna come in to the men's room. Get Ryan. He needs to lift me, and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel. Ryan is dead. No, he's not. Dead. I just saw him. No. Can you just get up yourself? You only grilled your foot. Forget it. I'll just get up myself. (MICHAEL GROANING) (CRASHING) Help! (GROANING) Oh, God! Do you think Dwight's being a little weird today? No. He's actually been really nice and helpful. And that isn't weird? Well Can I have everyone's attention, please? Phyllis. Oscar. Ryan, who is supposed to be dead. Can I ask you all a question? Do you know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar? I had scoliosis as a girl. Never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble. When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung. How old are you? No, it Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability. Although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles. I'm not disabled, and neither are you. Okay. What does this look like to you, Stanley? Mail Boxes Etc. Shut it. Okay. Well. Well, you know what? Disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me. Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder. (SIGHING) I burned my foot! Okay, 20 minutes, conference room, everybody's in there! Dad? While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society. JIM: Quick question. Yeah. Why is Tom Hanks on the wall? Twice. Good question. Forrest Gump, mentally challenged. Philadelphia, AIDS. I think that's from Big. I don't think so. No. Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia. He grew into a man overnight, rare disability. Still works. (SIGHING) A crossword puzzle, Stanley? Seriously, are you learning nothing here? Mmm-hmm. What do you mean, "Mmm-hmm"? I mean I'm learning nothing. Okay. Michael Scott. I'm looking for Michael Scott. Yes. Right in here. Good. Come on in. Great. This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest. Sorry I'm late. Somebody parked in the handicapped parking space. Hey, everyone, I'm Billy Merchant. You may have seen me around here before. I'm the Properties Manager of this office park. You are so brave. You are so brave. Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time But it's hard for you, right? Because you're in a wheelchair. No, I just have a lot of properties to manage. Let me ask you something. How long does it take for you to do something simple every day? Like brush your teeth in the morning. I don't know, like 30 seconds. Oh, my God. That's three times as long as it takes me. How did you get in your wheelchair? This morning? Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, hey, hey, hey! Not funny. Not funny. Hey, hey, relax. Just joking around here. Well, that's good. He still has a sense of humor. Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old. I don't really notice it anymore. Well, they do. They notice it, don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it? I wanna clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill. So, there were just a couple things I wanted to remind everybody of. Okay. First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? Yes. Yeah. Yes. Dwight, you have your hand up. Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick grill You know what, Michael? Yeah. Let me stop you right there. Okay. And leave. Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy. What's wrong with that guy? You mean today? He stepped on a George Foreman grill and he burned his foot. No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion. (MICHAEL POPPING BUBBLE WRAP) Hey. I found the pudding cups you wanted at a gas station in Carbondale! You did it. Look at you. And with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan. You are very welcome. Did you get the yams? No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams. (SIGHING) Oh, okay. I'll just have the pudding. You sure? Yeah. Okay. You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot. Yeah, baby! I am feeling better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain. RYAN: I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine. Oh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins. (EXCLAIMING) Okay, I think we need to take him to the hospital DWIGHT: No, no, no. 'cause I'm pretty sure he has a concussion. Oh, now you feel some compassion for him. He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think you should go with him. Why don't you go with him? I barely know him. I want Michael to take me. I can't take you. I don't have my car, and yours is all vomitty. You can take my van. Oh, okay. That's great. No, I can't drive. Jim, why don't you drive? Fine. We'll go. I'm still recovering, so let's just Ryan, can you get my coat, please? Slowly, slowly. Okay, let's just get to the elevator. (DWIGHT IMITATING HELICOPTER) What are you doing? Vietnam sounds. Stop it. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Tired. Dwight, you can't lay down. Let's take a break. Wake up. (GROANING) Wait, here, let me help you, Dwight. Come on. Okay, Pam. Thanks. Get up. Get up. You're the best. JIM: Just keep him awake. It smells like chicken soup. I know. I have to go to the hospital. I know. Where are we going? I just wanna say goodbye, okay? Well, I'll be back, I mean Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different. Why? It's just hard to explain. Oh, Pam, you're adorable. Oh, my goodness. Come here. Huggy-hugs. Shotgun! You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight? The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "shotgun" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game is played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion. Oh, God, a minivan. What is Meredith's problem? Well, I think she has a kid. Yeah, she has one kid and no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around. Where are we going? Come on, get inside. Where are we going? We're going to Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese. We're going to the hospital, Michael. I know. I'm just saying. Dwight, what are you drinking? I found it under the seat. Oh, my God. Dwight, put that down. I'm thirsty. No! Give the bottle to Michael. No! Give the bottle to Michael. Give it to me, Dwight. Just keep your eyes on the road. Give me the bottle or you're fired! You can't fire me. I don't work in this van. Give it to me, Dwight. No. Give me the bottle! Will you stop? Give me the bottle, Dwight! Michael, stop! Just give it. Michael, stop! Stop. Stop it! Stop spraying me! Give me the bottle! My eyes! Stop spraying me! Give me the bottle! Dwight, what is your middle name? Danger. Something with a "K." It's Kurt. Wow, I'm so sad that I know that. What do I write under "reason for visit"? Concussion. JIM: What did you write? (CLEARS THROAT) Nothing. I wrote, "Bringing someone to the hospital." So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital? No, no. You know what, Jim? This isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. Come on, Dwight. (SPUTTERING) Hi, Michael. Hi, Dwight. (MOANING) Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury? A head injury. Well, you don't have all the information. The foot has been fairly severely burned, and healed quickly, very quickly. Actually, like, suspiciously quickly. So I'm ordering a CAT scan. DWIGHT: What is that? Look, since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot in? We can take a look. Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot. Okay, what kind of machine is that? Does the skin look red and swollen? That's what she said. That's my joke. Damn it, Dwight. Okay, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment It's okay, they're with me. No metal of any kind. All right, well, I guess this is where we leave you off. I don't wanna do this. You should have thought of that before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. So, we'll see you when you get out. Oh. Fine. Fine. (BEEPS) (INAUDIBLE) (PHONE RINGING) Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim. Oh, my God. What's going on? Is Dwight okay? He should be fine, but they brought him in for a CAT scan. I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan. Michael went in there with him, too. It's pretty sweet. Really? Michael went in with him? Mmm-hmm. Wow. But they shouldn't be much longer now. So we'll be back soon. Okay, that's good news. Yeah, no, I'll let you go. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Hey, Oscar. What's up, Pam? I just wanted to let you know that Dwight's gonna be okay. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion. So he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow. Okay. I just thought you'd wanna know that. Okay, Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three. One, two Sir! Stop that. Stop. Stop that.
Nothing much, what's up with you? I cannot believe I fell for that. Oh, my gosh! What? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me. Is it me or does it smell like updog in here? What's "updog"? Nothing much, what's up with you? Oh, wow. I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant. Hey, Stanley, is that jacket made of updog? I'm on the phone. (STANLEY CHATTERING) What flavor coffee is that? Updog? What's that? I don't know. Nothing, what's up with you? Huh? No, damn it. What does that mean? What does what mean? That thing you just said. Just forget it. Dwight! Hey, is it me, or does this place smell like updog? What's "updog"? Gotcha! Oh, God. Crap. Nothing. How are you doing? Good. How are you doing? Damn it! MICHAEL: Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes, I know it's January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your spring cleaning in January, guess what you don't have to do in the spring! Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well, I say an empty desk means an Empty mind. No, that's not No, that's not what I was gonna say. Meredith, the men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes, they're worn down. Kevin, file drawers. Angela, kitchen. Oscar, dusting. Where is Oscar? He's out sick. That's unacceptable. I agree. It's unacceptable. What are you guys doing? Michael? Yes? Oscar is out sick. On a Friday? (PHONE RINGING) Can I do some of the talking? I will do the talking. Okay, let him know that I'm here. OSCAR: Hello? What difference does it make whether you're here? Hello? Hi, Oscar, it's Michael. And Dwight. Yeah. Heard you were under the weather? Yeah, I think I came down with the flu. Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today. Could've used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic. Yeah, I feel terrible about it. Ask him his symptoms, I'm on WebMD. What are your symptoms? I have the chills. I'm feeling nauseous, and my head's killing. Checks out. Michael, is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed. I need you to go to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday, unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend. I'll just be sleep Okay, first impressions. He sounded sick. Which is exactly how you'd want to sound, if you wanted someone to think you were sick. That's exactly what I was thinking. Question. May I investigate? Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks, doing their jobs. I bought my veil. Oh, my God, that is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid? Listen, you don't have to answer now, but how are you going to do your hair? Okay, I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like, loose with big curls? You look like an angel. I'm seriously gonna cry. Wowey! Mikey likey! Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time? It's much sexier. Man, this must be torture for you. Yeah, on the booze cruise, I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy, and had a couple of drinks, and I confided in the world's worst confidante. Hey, Michael. MICHAEL: Hey, Jim-bag! Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That was personal. So if we could just keep that between you and me, that would be great. Really? Who else knows? Nobody. Wow. Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But the fact that he told me his secret and no one else says everything about our friendship. And it is why I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can. My lips are sealed. (SINGING) My lips are sealed Bangles. All right. Great. Thank you. (SINGING) Can you hear me? They talk about us Telling lies Listen, temp. I'm conducting a little investigation. So, I'm no longer gonna be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it? Yeah, I think I can handle it. Do you think, or do you know? I think. Oh, God. Here. Hey, what you getting? I'm going with grape. Good stuff. Good stuff. Did you see the game last night? Which game? Any of them. So, what's the 411? Any updates on the "P" situation? I don't know any P-A-M. P-A-M. Yeah. Oh, okay. No, it's okay, we're talking code. What is? Listen, Stan, you know, how long does it take for you to pick out a soda? I'm gonna take off, actually. All right, well, cool. Still deciding? Peach ice tea. You're gonna hate it. Hey, Oscar. How you doing? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen, little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So, I was wondering if you could explain Oh, I see. So, sounds like you're too sick to come into work, but you're well enough to go to the pharmacy. There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hand, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately, I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful. It's grape! Soda! Tony the Tiger. Yeah. You don't hear that much anymore. Not so much. Okay, what is going on here? Nothing. Oh, really, nothing? Fact. You are drinking grape soda, you never drink grape soda. Fact. You are talking to Jim, you never talk to Jim. Fact. I love grape soda, I always have. Fact. Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets. Okay, so what is the secret, Michael? Look, I I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation. And he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material. Is that true? (STAMMERING) I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. Thank you, Michael. I know you're telling the truth. Okay. I can tell. I won't let you down. Good. Thanks. (SIGHING) Nice. That was slick. What are you doing for lunch? I don't know. I'm probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room. Oh, nonsense, no way. No. Why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat. No. That's all right. Thank you, though. It's I gotta do some cleaning, I should probably stick around here. Hey, you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room, have a little picnic, order some 'za. Talk about you know who. Oh, no. You know what? Let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out. I know just the place. Oh, man. You should order milk. Get it? Why do I like Hooters? Well, I will give you two reasons. The boobs and the hot wings. Here we go, here we go. Bogey at 3:00. Hi. Hey, I'm Dana, welcome to Hooters. We're not worthy, we're not worthy! Hello, Dana. I am Michael and this is Jim. And we are brothers. No. We're not brothers. I'm his boss, actually, and I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch because I can afford it. And he can have whatever he wants. Could I just have the ham and cheese sandwich? DANA: Great. Thanks. And for you? Tell me, Dana. How is your chicken breast? Oh, it's great. It's served with our world-famous wing sauce. Sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast, hold the chicken. (LAUGHS) Is that what you really want? No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog. Great. Who took all the black ones? That's a communal bowl. So, how did Oscar sound when he called in? Sick. Like lots of sniffling, I don't know. Sniffling, how? How many different ways are there to sniffle? Three. Okay, it was the second one. Okay, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard, now, was it? What do you like best about Pam? Oh, I really don't want to talk about it. Is it her legs, her boobs, her She's easy to talk to, I guess. And, uh, she's got a really good sense of humor. Really? Never gets any of my jokes. What about you? Her boobs, definitely. Wow. That's not what I meant. DANA: Here you go. Oh, thank you. And I understand we have a birthday today! Oh, happy birthday, Jim! DANA: Ready, girls? Front side! (SINGING) You put your front side in You put your front side out You put your front side in And you shake it all about You do the hokey-pokey And you turn yourself around That's what it's all about! Thank you. Oh, yeah! Thanks. Thanks, Dana. Thank you very much! There you go. Hilarious. Hey! What did you guys talk about? Just, you know, politics, literature. I hate you. Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this investigation in, like, 20 minutes. Including prep time? Just do it. RYAN: If I had to, I could clean out my desk in five seconds, and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget, too. MICHAEL: Expense this. Michael, is that a wig? No, it's I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig? No. This is from Hooters. Yeah. It's a business lunch. Did Toby approve this? No, he did not. I don't need his permission. You just got your corporate credit card back. You really want me to take it away again? (GROANING) It's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent 80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients, so business related. Right? I put a cigarette through a freaking quarter, and you know what, Toby, they almost bought from us. I'm not processing this. Look, Jim needed a relaxing lunch. He has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work-related? He seems fine to me. You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who is engaged, so just cut me some slack. Please? Pam? Angela, who would you choose? Jim or Roy? It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy. Jim has got it bad for Pam. Oh! Which one is Pam? Well, she's Hey, Michael. So, do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding? You know what, Kevin, Jim is a friend of mine. So, the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam, and me. DWIGHT: As a volunteer sheriff's deputy, I've been doing surveillance for years. One time, I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six nights straight. Turns out, she was. With a couple of guys, actually, so Mystery solved. Jim, why didn't you tell me that you had a crush on Pam? JIM: Well, the cat's out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam, and now I don't. Riveting. Yeah. No, it's not. Nice. She's so hot. Hey! Hey! Did you find anything good in your desk? Uh, coupon for a free sandwich. Score! Expired in August. And my cell phone charger from two years ago. Big day. Big day. Hey, listen. Um I told Michael on the booze cruise It's so stupid. I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here. Oh. Well, I just thought that I figured you should hear it from me rather than I mean, you know Michael. Right. And, seriously, it's totally not a big deal. Okay? And when I found out that you were engaged, I mean No, I know. Like, I kind of Like I thought that maybe you did when I first started. Oh, you did? No, I mean, just 'cause we, like, got along so well. Oh, yeah. No, yeah, you saw through me. Great. So, are you gonna be, like, totally awkward around me now? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hope that's okay. Mmm-hmm. And, Pam? It was, like, three years ago. So, I am totally over it. Cool. Okay. Stay low. This is it. There he is. He's been gone for at least two Who is that? Come to papa. (DWIGHT SNICKERING) Oh, yes. Let's roll. I knew it! (CAR APPROACHING) Oh, man! You are so busted! Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all. Who is this? This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this? Gil. Are you going to tell Michael? How about this. I don't tell Michael, and in exchange, you owe me one great big, giant favor, redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing. Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight. He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance? Probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance, for malfeasance's sake. JIM: Hey. I know. I know, I know. What happened? I Oh, just I was trying The expense reports And then Toby, you know, he just I know, I just I just hope it I just hope that this doesn't affect our friendship. It's stupid. It's so stupid. Hey, hey. Listen, man. You know, it's not a big deal. Well, okay. I'm fine. It's going to be fine. No, I know, I'm good, I'm good. It's just Look, it's one day. Everything's gonna be all right? Yeah. No big deal. You good? Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Creed, did you organize the menu book? I thought that was more on a volunteer basis. No. That was mandatory. Oh, I thought that was a volunteer thing. Hey, your schedule for next week. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Look. About you and Jim. I No. No, that's You don't have to I just feel it's my responsibility as your bosslfriend No, it's really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like, a crush on me when he first started, but that was a long time ago, so It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise. Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise? Okay, shut it, Michael. I'm done, that's it. I'm out. Ready? Yeah. MICHAEL: People are always coming to me, "Michael, I have a secret. "You're the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like, I was watching Cinemax last weekend, this movie. Portrait of a Prostitute, or something. Secrets of a Call More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character Shyla is framed for murder, goes on the run, and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't I don't wanna live like that. I like it here. I don't wanna be Shyla, I like being Michael Scott.
What? Oh, nothing. Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice. And she set a date for the wedding with Roy. June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that. (PHONE RINGING) What? Oh, nothing. Jim's been looking at me, kind of, a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me. MICHAEL: Spamster! Pam, plus Spam, plus Hamster. Right. Welcome back. How was your vacation? It was great. Yeah? Did you get lucky? (MICHAEL EXCLAIMING) Boink. Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get 10 vacation days a year and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible. And this year I got to the third week in January. "I am Pam." Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. Whoa! God! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! PAM: What? Yuck! Wow, what happened in there? I don't know. There is stink in there. My God. What is that? Oh, I don't know. Is that a bird? No, I don't think it's a bird. Oh, God. How could that happen? How could Right in the middle of the carpet. What's going on? Somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. I don't think that's vomit. Check it out. KEVIN: Me? MICHAEL: Check it out. Don't be a wuss. Just get No, I'm not holding your coffee. Tell me what it is. Oh, that's ridiculous. What is it? Michael. What is it? No, just tell me what it is! Michael, I gotta get out of here. I can't hold my breath that long. PAM: Open the door up. It smelled terrible. KEVIN: Oh! MICHAEL: Jeez Oh, no I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that there. That's no burst pipe. How do you know that? What is it then? Hey, guys. Somebody making soup? Here she comes. All clean? Great. (COUGHING) It's still stinky. That is worse. She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation. I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually. So this is sort of like my audition tape. (CLEARING THROAT) I can't stand it. I can't stay in here another second. No! Hey. Welcome back. Thanks! So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot? A little. Good. (DOOR OPENING) What's going on in here? What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. It was not me. Oh. Wow. (PAM LAUGHING) Hey, Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet. That might be a little difficult with the one computer. Oh, it's There's definitely a desk open in the back. Yeah. Which I guess I'll be taking. No, no, no. Seriously, I don't mind sharing. No, no, no. Seriously, I'll be in the back. Hey, Kelly. Are you moving back here? Just for the day, while Michael's at my desk. Because Toby used to sit there, but then he had to move over there because of an allergy. Allergy to the desk? Weird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen. The old bullpen. Don't ape me. Okay. This is great. Yeah. The pressures of my office are insane. I just You couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it easy out here. You know, I used to sit right here? No way. Yeah. And who had your office? Ed Truck. (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us, so stop having fun. "Start pretending to do work." What a jerk. He's You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away. I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up. 'Cause aren't all hangers, like, that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and I walk around the piles to get an outfit You know who used to sit at that desk? That guy Miles, who quit to form his own company? Todd Packer. No. Yeah. I thought he was out on the road. He was, but that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes. When I was in training, many years ago, not so long ago, I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer. And together we rocked the office. (HAMMERING LOUDLY) MICHAEL: Packer and I once spent a whole day with our pants off. And when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy. I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. Excuse me one second, please? What is it that you need right now that can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer? A customer. Well, sound the alarm. (CHUCKLING) Okay. Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like, a minute. The guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired. (GROANING) What did you hit me for? Charley horse! What? Charley horse! You shouldn't have hit me, Michael. Okay. Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. It was hysterical. Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones Hey, Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair. It's the lever on the side. That's what I told him. Thanks. Oh, my God, he is so cute. Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me? No, I don't think I can Oh, please, Jim. Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please, he's so cute. I like him so much. And I would do it, but I'm too shy. Please, Jim. Please, please, please. Please, Jim. Please, please, please. (WHISPERING) Dwight? Michael. Let's send up Accounting. What? Old-fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah, follow my lead. Hey, guys. Hey, Michael. What's up? Hey, Dwight. (SCREAMING WILDLY) (LAUGHING) MICHAEL: Come on, come on, come on, come on! MICHAEL: Sales rules! DWIGHT: Yes! Yeah! Yeah! DWIGHT: Should we help them pick up their stuff? MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that. Okay. Watch out, Pam. You're next. You're gonna throw my things on the ground? Maybe. OSCAR: What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it. It makes sense. But it was still wrong. Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her. You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense. Hello, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller? I'm totally gonna win us that box set. Stop. Jethro Tull Stop it. Stop it. Don't. Don't. I need to make a sales call. Please? All right. Am I the 107th caller? PAM: Back so soon. ROY: We can go back. ROY: We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe. Yeah, right. Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like, Presidents' Day or something? Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend. (KELLY TALKING INAUDIBLY) KELLY: And when I wake up, I feel fine. But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it KELLY: 'cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30. PAM: Are you kidding? ROY: No. Hi, guys. We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit. I'm just walking around. Were you? Well, yeah. It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael. Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are working for the weekend, aren't you? I am working for the week. Sales team. Listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit, literally. Right here I'm gonna put a crisp $100 bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good? Yeah! Seventy, eighty, one, two, three. $83. Still a lot of money and I'm going to I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here, and out of sight. Out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we? You're gonna compete against us? Oh, it is on, Phyllis. It is so on! It is so on! God, this is gonna be fun. Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us. So, you have and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good. Nice doing business with you. Thank you. Yes! Oh! Yeah. Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! (HUMMING VICTORIOUSLY) What's that? What are you doing? Nothing. I think he's dancing. No, just That was definitely not dancing. You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just DARRYL: Paper business. Yeah, paper business. Is this done? Nope. Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you'd be fired like that. Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know. Who do you think did it? Are you kidding? I thought it was you. Really? I thought you. MICHAEL: This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them. You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're not doing this today. That doesn't seem fair. You want to talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus, I just I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage. But you're the one who picked today. I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talking about. That's not what a hate crime is. Well, I hated it a lot, okay. I You know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done. Very well, then you're all punished. What's our punishment? You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. (PHONE RINGING) MICHAEL: No, no. Hey. What's up? Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually a little awkward. What? What do you think of Kelly? I don't know. It depends if you like a little junk in She's really cool. Are you interested in her? Yeah, totally. Really? Did she say something? She said lots of things. Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hanging out? I have no idea. Can you find out? Yeah. Sure. Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together. But don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows? Do you remember Ed Truck? Sure. He hired me. How's he doing? How would I know? I thought you might. My biggest fear is turning into him. Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that. I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you? Ed? Hi, thanks for meeting me. It must be kind of neat coming back. Yeah. Shall we go upstairs? Well, honestly, Ed, I really don't want to be up there right now. So, what's the problem with my pension? Oh, no, no, no, you're good. It was clerical. You're good. Well, somebody did something in my office and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me. Well, what was done? I didn't get a good look at it, but it smells horrible. Yeah, somebody once did that in my office. Really? Yeah. Well, that figures. So, how did you deal with people not liking you? You can't expect to be friends with everybody. Well, sure I can. No. They'll always think of you as a boss first. Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father. I'm not sure that ever happens. Well, okay. Different management styles. Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends? MICHAEL: Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would've reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "No. I only give my organs to my real friends. "Go get yourself a monkey kidney." Hey, Brenda, this is Jim Halpert, from the boat? And I got your number from the corporate directory, and well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? So, give me a call back. You can get my number from said directory. Or just check your e-mail, 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Give me a call back. I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye. You just asked a girl out on the phone. Yep. (PHONE RINGING) Yes. Hello, yes, I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott. Who is this? How did you get this number? Your mom, you gay nerd. Oh, my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack, how you doing? Hey, listen, did you get that package I left for you? No. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it? It was pretty big. Really? Yeah! Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it? Look in the middle of your office. Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office? You mean, the thing? (PACKER GUFFAWING) Are you kidding me? Special delivery. That was Packer! You are dead! You are dead, my friend. That is Oh, God! Of course it was you. Sit on the throne, Michael. Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my God! It was Packer! It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's God, these people are so These are good people. We have fun. We just have fun. Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out. (LAUGHING) FEMALE VOICE: You have seven unheard messages. (BEEPING) Hey, Jim, it's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back. Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator. Sudoku. Level, moderate. Time, 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert. I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is Okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would have happened. So, thank you. Hey, what's that word we made up for when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe. Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early and I'm not messing this up. So, I'll see you tomorrow. Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk.
So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well. Today is a "women in the workplace" thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times. Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles (KNOCKING ON DOOR) In getting there. So Hey, what's going on? Michael Yeah, you know what? I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here. I thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say. What are you doing? Just hear me out. What is more important than quality? Equality. Now, studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal Woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads. Michael And No, just You have come a long way, baby. But I just want to keep it within reason. JAN: Michael. They did this up in Albany You are not allowed in this session, okay? and they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room, which is disgusting. Now you're really not allowed in this session. Well, I'm their boss. I am your boss. Anybody want any coffee or anything? We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please. MICHAEL: Women in the workplace. Yeah. Translation, I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls. Whoa, sorry. Women of the workplace. About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I really apologize Jan? for that. Yes, Pam? Michael's still at the door. Michael! JAN: So, one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive tend to be admired. They're called Anyone? That's a terrible idea. JIM: What is? Them in there all together. They stay in there too long, they're gonna get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing. Everyone? Guys? Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby? Come on over. You're a guy, too. Sort of. MICHAEL: Let's do this! Well, first of all, I just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap. Let's just clap. Ready? Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Okay, I don't know what you're doing here, Michael Just having a little "guys in the workplace" thing. but it's very disruptive. Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals, when sitting down is far more comfortable? Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael? We have nowhere else, Jan. This We could do it in the warehouse. Dwight. Excellent idea. Go to the warehouse. Okay, fine. Actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There is another side to this place, gentlemen. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office, but do you realize that underneath us, there's another world? The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. MICHAEL: These guys are down there, they are real men, doing real men's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works. I think this is gonna work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job, and I haven't been there in months. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Remember on Lost when they met The Others? I am so sorry about that. So, where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes, then? Please? Yeah. Thank you very much. So, let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl. One of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear? My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time. You know what? Darryl is actually the foreman here, and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy, riding the big rig. So, Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And she's our receptionist. Sort of a "Brangelina" thing. Why? "Brangelina" is the Brad Pitt and Angelina. I don't understand. Roy Roy and Pam. It's a "Ram." It's a "Ram" thing. I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up. Thanks for the heads up, Kev. I got your back, if he does. But try to stay out of it. Just in case there's somebody down here who shouldn't be. A little Good Will Hunting situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day, a big day. Now, you may look around and see two groups here. White collar, blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind. Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at? I will start. I am good at public speaking. Hi. I'm Meredith, and I'm an Good at supplier relations. JAN: Great! Phyllis? I'm good at computer stuff. E-mails, spreadsheets. All that. Really? I don't know. I thought that JAN: No. Okay. Stop. PHYLLIS: You know, I've seen some of your spreadsheets, and I almost always Really? I thought they were pretty I don't know how I fit in with these women here, or with Jan. I mean, we get along great. Fine. I guess the person I have the most in common with is Jim Halpert! Hey, I, you know, heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam and Oh, no, no. No, no, it's cool, 'cause I know you're a good guy, and I know that that crush ended a long time ago. So, you know, we're cool. All right? Yeah. No, yeah. Definitely. You know, it's great with me. 'Cause that way I'm glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. Oh. And then she's not all "bap, bap, bap, bap," you know, when she gets home. Yeah. I like talking to her, too. So, we're cool, right? Yes. Yeah. Yup. Cool, man. Good. All right. Sweet. Hey, Mike, look. How about we go upstairs, too? You know, learn how an office works. Oh, well. We can both switch places for the day. Okay. Yeah. You know what? I don't You Your My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there. An experience Guys! Want to start unloading the truck? Okay. Let's go. Step up. Check this out. Look at that. Look at that. Hello, how are Okay. That's great. That is good stuff. In five years, I'd like to be five years sober. That is an excellent goal. Four and a half. I'll tell you one thing. I am not gonna be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan. JAN: Great. I want an SUV with three rows of seats. WOMAN: That would be great. I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women's seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts, women who could be a valuable addition to our corporate life. Michael wants us to bond, so we need topics for conversation. Ponies. No. How about rainbows? No. Flowers. No! That's dangerous, Mike. Come on, get down off the lift. Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself. Mike! Stand clear. Mike, get off of the lift. Please! Come on, now. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Look, would you Look We'll get somebody to clean that up. We're the ones that gotta clean that up! Damn it, Michael! MICHAEL: We have to have this thing serviced. So, guys' gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds, but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. And that's gonna happen. You know, we're guys, so Hey, do you want me to go? No, why would I? You can I'll go. stay, or And a big walk-in closet. Oh, that's part of my dream, too. KELLY: Oh, me, too. Great. Great. And, Pam? What about you? What is your dream? Well, I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it, stuff like that. Since I was a girl. More seriously, though, a husband that I love. Roy. And I love to draw. And I did a little in college, and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way. She's real good. Thanks. You know, the company is offering a design training program in New York. Well, I have a job right now. So, I can't really take time off. Well, it's only on weekends. And then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out. Well, it's just that the weekends aren't good because There are always a million reasons not to do something. Let's start with the warehouse. What bothers you as guys? You know? My priority is safety. Okay. So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here, speeding around on the lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't shush me. No, that was just That bothers me, too. I was breathing. Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy. I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing. What Okay. What is our beef, as human men? You know, that's a good question, Hasselhoff. Okay. All right. LONNY: What bugs us? Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do, and we love it. All right. Let's talk about clothing. I'm excited about today. I love girl talk. Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right, you can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be. I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman, the head of Accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore. I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night, and then they're like, "When are we gonna go on a date-date?" I hate that, too! I hate that, too! That sucks so hard. It totally sucks! Yeah, and then they make you drive them to church the next morning. Like, gas ain't free. Yeah, on our salaries, man. What do they expect? You know, "Take us out every weekend," you know what I mean? MICHAEL: I feel you, man. We're not millionaires. I feel you. No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what? Not literally. You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently. Yes. We work the same hours as you, and you just said we work a lot harder. You do. So But we get paid a lot less. Word. Like, next to no benefits. MICHAEL: I know. God, what is that? Exactly. It blows. It blows, man! You know, this would not happen if we had a union. That's what I'm talking about. Absolutely, that's what we need to do. You're right. See, that's what I've been saying, man. We need to do this, finally. You know what, is that necessary? 'Cause you already, sort of, have a union of guys. It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? Yeah? Do you still have that card from the dockworkers' union? Dockworkers? In my truck. Come on, man. Yeah. MICHAEL: You know what? I think our problem is the chicks. The problem is the chicks. Union! Yeah! And you gotta blame them. Are you with us, Mike? Yeah Welcome to the warehouse. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) I'm sure that all of you have dealt with that before. This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I wanted Can I help you? I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union, and they have some good points. What? A union? Don't get hysterical. I'm not. Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women. Let's be rational here. What are the pros? What are the cons? The cons are that everyone will lose their job, Michael. Everyone. Office, warehouse What do you think the pros are here? Don't talk to me that way, please. Just They're gonna want to hear this from you. You got yourself into this, Michael, so We're bonding down there. you get yourself out of it. That's too bad. I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not gonna want to hear. Now who's getting hysterical? Okay. Come on, Jan. After all we've been through Michael, Michael We have a history. We have a history between us. Michael. Don't say another word. Get yourself downstairs. I'm just saying that we have something. Okay. Whatever. You know what? We could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line. This here is a "run out the clock" situation. Just like upstairs. Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly, but many women ask to go over it, so, "fumble" means Mistake. Slip. Right. "Par for the course" is a golf term. It means "right on track." "Below par" means "worse." Wait. That should mean better. That doesn't make sense. What about "second base"? Like, if Michael said he got to second base with you, does that mean you, like, closed a deal? Excuse me? I mean, that's a baseball term, right? I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know. KELLY: Like, you went to Chili's, and he got to second base with you. Excuse me. Kelly, I don't know what Michael was talking about. He just told everybody, and I just want to know if that's Hey. Hey. How's it going down there? It's a complete Well, actually, it's exactly what you'd expect, so How are the girls? Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies. Did you really? No. Oh. (CHUCKLING) Almost. But, hey, something kind of cool, there's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great. Nice! Well, what's it all about? I think you should do it. That's great! It's really cool. Cold front coming into the warehouse! Better put on your ski boots! (MICHAEL CHEERING) Happy New Year, Darryl. Hey, Darryl. You ever done this? Are you married? I'm divorced. That must have been hard. It was, yes. You were probably feeling really depressed and sad, and that's why you did that thing with Michael. I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers, and less time on personal stuff. I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck. ANGELA: At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God. Okay. Let's take five. I think we could all use five. How can someone so beautiful be so sad? Hi. Did you take care of the situation? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I have Excuse me. Excuse me. essentially, yes, I have taken I'm told that there has been some interest in forming a union, and that Michael supported it. Obviously, he's not a friend of yours, because he didn't tell you the facts. So, let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that. They unionized in Pittsfield, and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues, and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions, you can direct them to To Michael. PAM: Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice, but, I don't know, it was just something I read in this book when I was 12. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom, and she planted flowers on it, and I just loved that. It just always kind of stuck with me. So, you're not doing it. How did you know? Why not? It's just, like No big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons. Come on. Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's gonna lead to anything, anyway. Roy said that? What? You have something you want to say? You gotta take a chance on something, sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always? Oh, excuse me, I'm fine with my choices. You are? Yeah. It's impractical. I'm not gonna try to get a house like that. They don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never gonna I'm just gonna put this over there. This is not a good idea, right here. Easy does it. Okay. Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza? Hey. Look, guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, watch it. Watch it. We have a relationship. Thank you to our hosts. DARRYL: Hey, Michael! This ain't over. (SIGHING) Excellent. Is it good to be back? Yeah. I mean, I love the guy stuff, but to run an office, you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting. (PHONE RINGING) Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Snow angels. Snow angels.
(PHONE RINGING) I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kind of like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like, last year, Jim gave me this card with Dwight's head on it. It was horrifying and funny and (DOOR OPENS) Phyllis. MAN: You could just sign here. PAM: Roy and I are saving for the wedding. So I made him promise not to get me anything too big. "Happy Valentine's Day, darling. Love, Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration." Isn't he sweet? Oh, yeah. Wow. All right, Dwight, as you know I'm heading to New York today, doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO. And you want me to come with you. No. The opposite of that. I will stay here and run things on this end. Very good. Question: Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York? I probably will. Why do you ask? Well, it's Valentine's Day. And you guys, you know Well. screwed. What is your problem? This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an e-mail this morning. But it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. The City of Love. Hey, Pam. You heart NY, right? You want me to pick you up anything? That's okay. All right. The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO. Dude. I'm going to nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. "Forget about it!" See you. Well, here we go, on our way to New York. New York, New York. The city so nice, they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name. JIM: So, I broke up with Katy and I haven't been dating anybody else. So, this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's going to be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lot of money, because they're idiots. It's gonna be great. What's this? What is this? I don't know. It's on your desk. Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose? It was there when I sat down. "Happy Valentine's Day." It's me. I'm the Bobble Head. Yes! (EXCLAIMS) The meeting isn't till 3:00. But I always like to come to New York a little bit early, and hit some of my favorite haunts. Like right here is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm going to go get me a New York slice. Hey, Kelly, what's up? Nothing. Oh! Except Oh, my God, Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome. That's great. I'm really happy for you. I know, and it was so funny. 'Cause we were at this bar with his friends, and I was sitting next to him the whole night, and he wasn't making a move. So in my head I was like, "Ryan, what's taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say. Wow. So I said," Ryan, what took you so long?" I mean, I just said it to him. Can you believe that? Wow. Oh, my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed. No. Don't be. Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim. No. All right You will not believe I was so nervous. I bet. But now Now I have a boyfriend. All right. I hooked up with her on February 13th. Here it is. The heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people, when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building. That's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. We have Bubba Gump shrimp, Red Lobster down there. You know This is the heart of civilization, right here. (EXCLAIMING) Guess what. Really? It's from Bob, again. That's great. Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast. It's efficient. Gets you there on time. It's a way to Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there. This is the world-famous Rockefeller Center, founded, of course, by Theodore Rockefeller. This is the skating rink. And I think the Rangers practice there sometimes. And it's That's Tina Fey. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. (CLEARS THROAT) Hello. Hello. Hi. Oh, I'm I'm sorry. I thought you were Okay. I thought that was She looked like She looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello. I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So Are you serious? He was here? When? When I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! Are you serious? Hello, Angela, did you hear? Somebody totally rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten. Really? I wouldn't know anything about that. But I'm glad you enjoyed it. Oh, I did. I did. I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day. Oh, I bet you will, before the day is over. Really? Well, I hope I do. MICHAEL: I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work at Corporate with Jan. That would be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York is like Scranton on acid. No, on speed. No, on steroids. Okay, um I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back Should be back this way. MICHAEL: There's a lot of pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan in the NBA finals, or like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf. And this presentation is Desert Storm. And as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it. No, that's all right. Spend money on her instead of giving it to us, that's fine. No. I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah. All right, man. Okay, have a good night. Bye. Phyllis Lapin? Holy God. It's from Bob. Man, that thing's bigger than I am. No, it's not. Oh, zip it. Wow. There they are. What's up? Hey. Hey, hey. Michael Scott. Josh Porter. High five. Bam. All right. You know Dan Gore, from Buffalo? Yeah, how you doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. What's up, buddy? You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true? Guilty, yeah. Well So, what's going on? What'd I miss? Not much. They're, I guess, running late upstairs. We're just waiting for the presentations. Cool, good, good. Good. Give us some time to catch up and Pam. Hi, how're you doing? Good. Listen, may I speak with you, privately? You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here. No, Pam, just I'm Just Please. You need to get something for your girlfriend? Girlfriend, yes. And the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person, who shall remain nameless, is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of Tightly wound? Exactly. Okay. Well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like, what it means instead of what it is. You mean, like a ham? No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her, that you remember her. Okay, I get it. That's great. Okay, shut up. I know exactly what to do. What about you, Craig? Did you lose anyone? Oh, man. Jan called me in September, and she's like, "You gotta fire four people," and I was just like, "What?" You know. Did you? No. I just ignored her. She is the worst. Well, she is our boss, so She ain't my boss, dude. I don't work for that bitch. Hey, come on, you know, that's not What? Cool it. You like Jan? How can you like Jan? Maybe because she's my girlfriend. Was. Or not my girlfriend. She We hooked up and You hooked up with Jan? It's just, you know, it was months ago. Just It was just once. It was, God, just stupid. Just Just forget it. Yeah, let's change the subject. Yeah, yeah. I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever. Well, I'd take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time, things like that need to Soda. Cool. Hey, so, do you want to do something tonight, or Oh, no, not while I'm here. I mean, I know that it's Valentine's Day or whatever. But there's totally no pressure at all of any kind whatsoever. So I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends. Okay, that's cool. Okay. I completely understand. Cool. Okay. Josh Porter, Stamford. David. Nice to meet you. And Michael Scott, Scranton. Nice to meet you. Ditto. How are you, Jan? Fine, Michael, thank you. Okay. So, we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strength. All I'd like to do today is to hear you JAN: Nervous? No, I'm not nervous. Well, I mean, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. The new CFO is judging me on this, too. And, well, it is Michael, so Yeah. I am very nervous. So, with the 12 new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets. Thanks very much. Thank you. Okay, Michael. (CLEARS THROAT) What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But, as you know, David, and Jan, it is much more. MICHAEL: Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, we're not just in the paper business. We're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks who make the Scranton branch so special. This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesmen. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmarks of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our basis on. MICHAEL: Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. Was thinking about entering it in some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about, but MICHAEL: And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes, or try on Phyllis' pants. Next time you're in town, give us a call. Stop on by. I'm sure you'll be greeted by a big smile, and a "How're you doing, pal?" Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know that you're home. MALE VOICE: Great Scott! Questions? Wow. Okay. Okay, thank you, Michael, that was great. Yes, thank you. But for right now, what I'd really like to know about is the branch's performance. So, do you have that information as well? Yes. Absolutely, David. Let me get that for you. I Can you sign? Yeah. Oscar. Nothing for me? Join the club. Who's it from? My mom. It's frustrating, 'cause we'd be so perfect together. You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was into you, right? It'd be great. But he isn't. So Yeah, but it would be so great if he was. Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on, try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight. Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? And that about does it, thank you. Okay. Craig. Yeah, here's the deal. I did not understand that this was supposed to be a full-on, like, report or whatnot. I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant? I was under the impression this was more of, like, a meet-and-greet type deal. So, does that mean that you don't have the numbers on your branch? That is correct. Yes. Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether drastic steps need to be taken. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Well, the point is, that this doesn't exactly bode well for your branch. Oh, man. You know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get in any trouble. Maybe I should have slept with you, too. Okay, okay. All right, this No, no, no. I'm not I'm not I just I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, I'm probably gonna get fired. No, you're not. Yeah, I Michael, the CFO thinks that we slept together. Don't you understand? People get fired for much less. And I just can't believe that you told everybody. And we didn't even sleep together. Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So Oh, God. Michael, it was months ago. It was once. It's over. Do you understand? Yes, I'm sorry. I'll fix it. I will talk to him. I'll talk to David. Surely, you cannot be serious. I am serious. "And don't call me Shirley." Airplane! DWIGHT: Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly. The way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving. Hey, babe. Hey. You almost ready to go? I guess. Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just that I had to sit here all day while Phyllis got, like, an entire garden delivered to her. What? You're mad at me? I mean, I know that we said, "No big gifts," but I was, kind of, hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day. Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of your life. You understand this is a very serious situation. No, no, no, no, no. Yes, I Okay, well All right, here's the deal. This is my fault, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke, and Craig, the idiot, took it seriously. You made a joke? I did. It was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. Well, I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss I know. It was borderline at best. And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and I'm really sorry, and that will never happen again. That's fine. Let's just Just forget it. Okay. Good. Heading out? Yeah. All right, Beesly. Hey, Happy Valentine's Day. Bye. Good night, Pam. Night, Phyllis. JAN: Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice. Oh, no big deal. Really, sorry again. Oh, no, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. So Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. Okay. (EXCLAIMING) (SPEAKING YIDDISH)
Let's think this through. If we ask corporate for that, then They are either gonna say yes or no. MICHAEL: Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say. Think it through! We have to think it through! Because, if they say no Can we not? No Yes, we have to. You know why? 'Cause I don't like to be cooped up in that office. In that box, all day long. Heisman! Because I need to think, okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin! Ooh! (MICHAEL LAUGHING) Nice catch. (EXCLAIMING) Oscar! Intercepted. Right here. Give it to me. Sorry about that. Phyllis, give me the ball. Okay, give me the ball. Give me MICHAEL: You guys Oh, cool. Creed, give me the ball, right now. Give it to me. Ryan. (SHOUTING) DWIGHT: Fumble! (GRUNTING) MICHAEL: Listen All right, hey, Dwight Whoa! DWIGHT: Hike. MICHAEL: You all right, Ryan? Ryan? Yeah. Pam! Oh, they're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. DVD burner. Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You're so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the ninth-place prize again? A loaf of bread? A Cugino's Pizza. Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs? JIM: Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-based mid-sized paper company regional salesman can attain. So What did I do to deserve this? PAM: Are you sad that Dwight beat you? No. Are you gonna cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue? Hey. I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures? PAM: Oh, I Yeah. I'll show them to you later. Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later. Okay, cool. I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff and I just I don't want to offend Angela or someone. That's what she said. I don't get it. Grapes, seductive. So, you ready for the big speech this afternoon? Well, it's not really a big speech. You're still coming, right? Oh, abso-fruitly. Fruit, grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life. Speaker at the sales convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because somebody gives you proof of it. "Sir, you're awesome. Here's a plaque. "What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? "Here's a certificate." They stopped making plaques that year. What if I give a really long, extended thank you, for instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very" That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen, and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act. When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school spelling bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled in front of the entire school the word "failure." I can't do this. That's because you're incapable of doing it, because you don't know how, because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time. Oh, okay. But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company. Okay, deal. I'll do whatever you say, no questions asked. Well, if you have a question, you should ask me. I'll try and think of one. When Don't try to think of a question to humor me. Just try not to be such an idiot. Is that an insult, or is that part of the public speaking advice? Insult. PAM: Mom, I'm sorry, I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes. Well, if you really want my opinion JIM: Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents? I'm gonna take a trip. I'm gonna get out of town for a while, and go someplace not here. Where do I want to go? That is an excellent question. And one I probably should have thought about before I called you. OSCAR: I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do. But I don't care. But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? A saleswoman has a vagina. It's a joke, Dwight, it's not a sex ed class. But I'm right. Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke. All right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs. Hey, do you remember the speeches that you gave? I do, both of them. Could I have a copy of one of them? No, no, they would remember. Look, it doesn't matter what you say, it just matters that you're saying something that people care about. You know? All right, here we go. Watch this. Attention, everybody! Attention, please! I have some very great news from corporate. We had a wonderful quarter. And as a result, all of you are getting bonuses for $1,000. Yeah! MICHAEL: Congratulations. PHYLLIS: Unbelievable. OSCAR: It's great. PAM: Wow. You see that? You see how they responded to me? That's amazing. In that moment, I had them. That is so great about the bonus. No, no, it's not true. I was just talking. So just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up, they're a great audience. Go ahead, get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want Excuse me! May I have your attention, please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped, there is broken glass everywhere, several people are injured. Do we know anyone who was in the accident? Brad Pitt. Also, there will be no bonuses. Why would this affect our bonuses? They're unrelated. Is Brad okay? He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing. What the hell's going on here? Are we out of jobs? Yes. KELLY: This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston. He was kidding! Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny and it was just horrible STANLEY: Michael? Yeah? You said we were getting bonuses. All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it! STANLEY: Cancel the wallpaper. As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can, and did, twice. You saw the plaque, right? All right, we're all gonna go around the room, and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking. You mean toastmasters? MICHAEL: Pam! I'm public speaking, stop public interrupting me! Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast. Yeah, the bride doesn't really do Have you ever been to a wedding? JIM: Can I go? Yes, good. Jim taking the initiative. So, I am going on a trip. But I'm not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So, I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions. You should go to Hedonism. What is that? It's like Club Med, but everything is naked. I was thinking more like Europe or something like that, but good second choice. TOBY: I've been to Amsterdam. Oh, okay, you know what? That's not a toast, you're not standing up. To Amsterdam. When did you go there? After my divorce. JIM: Really? Yeah. JIM: For, like, how long? About a week, or maybe a month. I can't Jimmy, listen to me, you do not wanna go to Amsterdam, trust me. Where do I wanna go? I'd send you to Hong Kong. I'd like to say hi to my friends in China. (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN) Okay. Dwight, show us what you have learned today. Good morning, Vietnam! ALL: Oh, God. Okay, you know what, this isn't working, because I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates. No, we're not. Yes, you are. I'm assistant regional manager. Which means absolutely nothing. Michael, can you explain? Well, it's mostly made up. So MICHAEL: Dwight is not going to do a good job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence, because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row, I killed. It was amazing. Confidence, Dwight! Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go? I can travel anywhere except Cuba, and I will travel to New Zealand and walk The Lord of the Rings trail to Mordor, and then I will hike Mount Doom. So now, just leave me alone. Okay. I was just trying to get some advice on my trip. Oh, please. You're not taking any trip. You know, I majored in Public Speaking in college. You did? Mmm-hmm. And the first thing that they teach you is that you've gotta be true to yourself. And you are all about authority. Yes. I am. The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers, they were people of passion. So, if you wanna do well today, you gotta do what they did. Which is? You've gotta wave your arms, and you've gotta pound your fists many times. You're supposed to emphasize your point. Okay, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one, originally given by Benito Mussolini. Okay, look, I know you're giving this speech on your own, but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind. I'll glance at it. It's time, Dwight, the Grim Reaper is here. The very best of luck to you, Dwight. Thank you, Angela. Why'd you pick the V.A. For the reception? Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think. You're inviting Jim? Of course, he's one of my closest friends. DWIGHT: All right. You ready? Here we go. Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. MICHAEL: Come on. We're down here in the front. You all ready for this? (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) I am just feeling under the weather, and I think that I will go home and rest. I've never, ever seen you take a sick day. Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us. Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin salesman of the year, Dwight Schrute! (WHISPERING) Dwight, they called your name. Dwight, how we doing? No. I can't. Okay, you know what? I can't. You know what? Okay no, no problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. All right! Good morning, Vietnam! I am not Dwight Schrute, not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? I always set it at 69. Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy is in charge of for this wedding, but all he's managed to do is set a date. But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married? Actually, I don't see ever getting married. Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just I know what I said. I'm very sorry, I did not know that you were wearing a hearing aid, and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. And now, the black guy from the Police Academy movies, a robot. (MIMICKING ROBOT) Michael Winslow. Anyone? Car starting. (MIMICKING CAR ENGINE REVVING) All right, Dwight Schrute, everyone. Good luck, that is a tough crowd. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (DWIGHT CLEARING THROAT) Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day, how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment, as a child, when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime struggle, a never-ending fight! I say to you, and you will understand, that it is a privilege to fight! We are warriors! Salesmen of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you, once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour! Yeah! Yeah! I've got a timeshare in Key West that might be available. Maybe. Thanks. You really think you're gonna go? Yeah, I'm definitely going. Nice. Send me a postcard. RYAN: Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich every day for lunch. I don't know, if I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia. No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself! DWIGHT: Some people will tell you "salesman" is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door-to-door charlatans. This is our duty to change their perception. I say, salesmen and women of the world, unite! We must never acquiesce, for it is together Together that we prevail! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is ALL: Together that we prevail! Australia? I have always wanted to go there. I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor, but, other than that Yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable. That's awesome. Where are you staying? I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details, but When are you leaving? I'm leaving on June 8th. Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that. I just Yeah, that's too bad. Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out? It's okay. I got it. All right. Okay, thanks. There you are. What happened? I got thirsty. How'd it go? It was amazing. I wish you would have been there. You would not believe what happened here. What? Something happened? This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID, which I thought was odd, because I pegged her at, like, 35. Weird. Yeah, really weird. So, she's like, "I don't have my ID, please give me one." And he's, like, "I can't do that. I can't serve you." Con artist. She might have been. So she says, "Fine. I will go to my room, I will get my purse, "I will come back, I'll show you my ID." She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in the room, drinking from the mini bar. MICHAEL: Right? MICHAEL: Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street, anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar story. So I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys.
PAM: I am actually looking forward to "Take Your Daughter to Work Day." I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better because I'm getting married. So I put out a bunch of extra candy on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. Like the witch in Hansel and Gretel. Bribery. Nice. Oh, I have more. Name's Pam. Miss Beesly, if you're nasty. Janet Jackson. Hey, you having a wardrobe malfunction there Michael, you can't be nasty today. Because of that. Oh, God. Is that today? I reminded you last night. Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kids' environment. This is like HBO. No limits. MICHAEL: Who knows what I'm gonna say? Crazy stuff. And it is "R" rated. It is not rated "G." I am like Eddie Murphy in Raw. And they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in Daddy Day Care. Both great movies, but still. Well, I'll be in my office. Don't you think you should say something? They're cool. Michael, I think that as the boss you should really Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott and I am in charge of this place. (MUTTERING) How do I make you understand I am like Superman. And the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. That's Batman. That's Batman. Okay. I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys? The ocean. I work with a bunch of nerds. (DOOR SLAMMING) Hello, tiny one. Come on. You are the future. This is my file cabinet. Oh, this is the partition between my desk and Angela's. Abby's my fiancee Stacey's daughter. I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. Actually, I better go check. Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa. Oh, yes. Hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? If you don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the frat boys away from her. I'm in eighth grade. STANLEY: She's in middle school. Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time. It's not that children make me uncomfortable. It's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle. They want how many spiral pads? Well, 50 I over-ordered because they had a back-order. MICHAEL: Okay. MEREDITH: I got permission to bring Jakey in to work. Which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter. Will you pull that down there? Okay, tell them what you wanted to say. Do you need any help? No. Thanks. We'd have to explain everything. It's probably just easier if we do it ourselves. All right, I wasn't expecting that. Let's go draw. Oh, my God. She is so cute I wanna die. Don't you just love kids, Angela? I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys. God, I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies. Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun. And I'm learning that fun for Kelly is getting married and having babies, immediately, with me. Just compare last year's order to this year's. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Yes. We Yeah, they're very They're different. Yeah, we can stick with last year's, we're just gonna have to supplement it, somehow. Hey, Abby, do you wanna help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool. No thanks. I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one. What are you reading? From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Best book. Yeah, but I've read it before. So have I. Hey, question: If you had to spend the night in the Met or the aquarium, which would it be? Definitely the aquarium. Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. You don't wanna help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause I'm kind of swamped. Sure. Really? Yes. And you're Abby, right? Yeah. I'm Jim. JIM: And, let's sell some paper. ABBY: All right. Let's start with your mom. Yes. Well, we can Hey, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. Hello. Can I help you? You can pick that up if you want. That's all right. You wanna bring it over Here, I'll make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name? Sasha. Nice to meet you. Oh, you know what that is? That is a train whistle. Like I'm the conductor. But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here. Right? (WHISTLE TOOTING) You wanna try? Sure. All aboard for sales! Next stop, Kukabonga. (GIGGLES) (GROANING) You broke my hand! There is no way that hurt. Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight. Little girl, come over here. Shake my hand. Come on. I don't have all day. I don't feel anything. Nothing. You're so weak. Excuse me. These are expensive collectors' items, okay? Do you have any computer games? No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be inappropriate. Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here. You call your mom, Meredith? That's very disrespectful. Whatever, okay? You can refer to me as Mr. Schrute. That's your name? Mr. Poop? Schrute. Mr. Schrute. Sure, Mr. Poop. Schrute. Are you Mother Goose? I drink like a hundred iced macchiatos a day and practically nothing else. Wow. There's a really cool coffee place, Jitterz, at the Steamtown Mall. You ever been there? No. You've never been to Jitterz? Ryan, you are so dorky. Give me your number so I can text you. MELISSA: Come on. Do you have an e-mail address? I may be wrong, but I just thought you should know. I think something a little fishy is going on. STANLEY: A little fishy? KELLY: Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, and I just think That little girl is a child! I don't wanna see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Boy, have you lost your mind? No. 'Cause I'll help you find it. What you looking for? Ain't nobody gonna help you out there. Jesus can come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child. Okay. Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. That was Greensleeves, a traditional English ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat. A book my grom-mutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story. It's called Struwwelpeterl by Heinrich Hoffmann from 1864. "The great tall tailor always comes "to little girls that suck their thumbs." Are you listening, Sasha? Right? "And ere they dream what he's about, "he takes his great sharp scissors out "and then cuts their thumbs clean off." Dwight, Dwight There's a photo. What the hell are you reading to them? These are cautionary tales for kids. My grom-mutter used to read them Yeah, you know what? No, no, no, no. They No. The kids don't wanna hear some weirdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you. What's a Nazi? What's a Nazi? Nazi was a fascist movement Don't From the 1930s in Germany Don't, don't talk about Nazis in front of You know what? They're gonna have nightmares. MICHAEL: Why don't you just shut it? I was gonna teach the children how to make cornhusk dolls. Why don't you just leave, okay? Okay. Bye, Mr. Poop. All right. There goes Mr. Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? I do! I do! Children cannot lie. They are innocent and they speak the truth. And out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities. This is where the magic happens. Right over here. Let me show you this. See all these? You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions? So, you cut the paper and dye it and stuff? No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us, cut and dyed, from a paper manufacturer. And then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. That's not fair. No. Yes, it is. Well No. You need someone in the middle to facilitate You're just a middleman. I'm not just a middleman. Wait. Why doesn't the sawmill just sell the paper directly to people? You are describing Office Depot. And they're kind of running us out of business. We have better service than they do. There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody. This is Creed. And he is in charge of something. Right? That is correct. Say hi to the kids. Hi, kids. Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? MICHAEL: What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Just No, no, no, no, no! Would you cut it out? What is your problem? The hair covers it up mostly. No, no, no, we're not gonna see the four-toed Creed, okay? You know, there's something interesting about me that you might want to know. I used to be the star of a kids' show. CHILDREN: No way! MICHAEL: It's true. I did. MELISSA: You serious? I am totally serious. There was a show called Fundle Bundle and I was the star. ABBY: That doesn't sound like a show. It's true. I can prove it. I can prove it. Watch this. Ryan! Can you come here a second? (MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT) I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson City. And if she is at the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked. I want you to boost yourself up. All right. I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled "Fundle Bundle." I want you to grab it. I want you to get my guitar. Right. Okay. I want you to get a tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? I'm already getting the pizzas from Brunetti's, so You know, I can go with him. No! I will go. Okay. Thank you, Ryan. Good attitude. Hottest in the office. All right. Now, what kind of pizza do you like? MICHAEL: I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives. They're adults, for God's sake. I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott, when he was a child star and a show that you might remember called Fundle Bundle. MICHAEL: Okay, without further ado, Ryan. WOMAN ON TV: Fundle, are you ready CHILDREN: Yeah! Let's have some fun! That is Miss Trudy. You can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. MICHAEL: Okay, you can fast-forward. And I want you JIM: Is that a real, functioning windmill? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop. Yes! That is Edward R. Meow. That's pretty funny. Yes. Recess! Hey, what's your name? My name's Chet. Well, hi, Chet. Is that Chet Montgomery? MICHAEL: I don't know. That is! He's the meteorologist from channel 5. "Checking in with Chet. Doppler 7." ROY: That guy's legit. What do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna be on TV. And he is on TV now! Would everybody please shut up? Please. So you don't miss it. Okay, next. So, what's your name? Oh, that's me! That's me! (ROY LAUGHING) What's your favorite subject in school? Recess. Recess. So, tell me, what do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna be married and have a 100 kids so I can have 100 friends, and no one can say no to being my friend. Okay. Well, nice talking with you, Michael. Back to you, Miss Trudy. Hi, everyone. It's one of my favorite I could have sworn there was Did you get married? No. Why not? It just never happened. So, do you have any kids? Nope. JAKE: Do you have a girlfriend? I do okay. MELISSA: Was Chet Montgomery cool back then? Yes. JAKE: Even I have a girlfriend. Okay. All right. Okay. So, you didn't get to be what you wanted to be? I guess not. You know, I have a load of work to do. So, I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza and I'm gonna go do my work. Bye. He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone. I can't believe his mom dressed him like that. That's the real tragedy. Pam, Pam! I love this guy! Come on! So, Melissa, I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice. Who, Teri? That woman is not my mother. That is my stepmother. Mr. Poop, I have to tell you something. Okay. But first, that's not my name. You're ugly. Well, at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So Meredith! (MOCKING) Yeah? I think these belong to you. Oh, that's okay. She can keep those. Believe me, she has enough toys. She doesn't need your watch. Thank you. Is everything okay? You have to ask me that because you work for Human Resources. That's true. You know, sure, playing the field is great. Don't get me wrong. But there's more to life than notches on my bedpost. Tell me something honestly. Do you think that it is too late for me to have kids? Well, you need a wife first. Or at least a girlfriend. What about Not Jan. Okay. If you really wanna have kids, I guess you could somehow A foster parent or something. Or biologically. Somehow. Thanks. That's No, that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather? Because Yes. Okay. Is it okay if I take one? Sure. Thank you. You're welcome. Is your job hard? It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes. Do you wanna see? Yeah! Really? Yeah. Okay. Here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. (SHREDDER HUMMING) (PAPER CRACKLING) Cool, huh? That's so cool, yeah! Yeah, I get to do this, like, every week. That's so awesome. I know. Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it. And I am going to do it. I need a username. And I have a great one. Little Kid Lover. That way people will know exactly where my priorities are at. Go ahead. Do you wanna come over for dinner tonight? Oh, man, I would love to. I can't tonight. But can I come over some other time? What are you doing? You never have plans. Thanks, Kev. I'm actually going on a date. Nice. MICHAEL: Hey, no please. You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do. (SINGING) You who are on the road Must have a code that you can live by BOTH: And so become yourself Because the past is just a good bye And teach your children well Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play. I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. And feed them on your dreams My theory is that The one they picks the one you'll know by Don't you ever ask them why If I told you, you would cry You just look at them and sigh and know they love you And they do. Your parents love you very much. One more time. You The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. No, they didn't eat the children. It never came to that.
So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you. Who is this guy again? Don't worry about Phil. He drives a Corvette. He's doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. Who uses calling cards anymore? You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan. I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend. It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme. Yes, thank you. You will get rich quick. We all will. Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, that one from the e-mail? You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed King of Nigeria e-mails you directly asking for help, you help. His father ran the freaking country, okay? All right, so raise your hand if you wanna get rich. All right. No. How is this not a pyramid scheme? All right, let me explain, again. (MICHAEL GRUNTING) MICHAEL: Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more people who are investing, the more money we're all gonna make. It's not a pyramid scheme. It is a It's not even a scheme, per se. It's I have to go make a call. Happy birthday, Michael. What? I said, "Happy birthday." Thank you. That's really nice. Today is my B-day. And people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh, fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a perfect icebreaker if I ever meet Teri Hatcher. You excited? Everybody freaking out? Cool. It's gonna be fun. You're late. Thank you, it's noon. But, I forgive you. Because doth, it is my birthday. What's up? JIM: Hi. Oh, happy birthday. Thank you, sir. JIM: Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. And then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done. Did you hear anything yet? No. I'm still waiting. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Yes. There he is, the birthday boy. Oh, God. Birthday hug. No, no, no, no. New suit. Please. That suit is amazing. Thank you very much. It is from Italy. Actually, Bulgaria. So Maybe I should get one. Good luck. One-of-a-kind. EBay. Question: May I be in charge of the party planning festivities? Not necessary. The Party Planning Committee is all over it. They've been working 24l7, all day, yesterday. Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the Don't! No. Please. Don't want to spoil it for anybody. Don't spoil the surprise. Let's get the party started. Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you. (HUMMING) When should we bring out the cake, I'm sorry, are we boring you? I Party Planning Committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority. Where do we get those? Not my problem. Here's a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. Michael wants a stripper gram? Yes, but he doesn't want to know when or whom. No. This is a closed-door meeting. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah. PAM: Michael, I have Jan on the line. Oh, great, put her through. Okay. JAN: Hello, Michael? Hey, you. I'm returning your call. You said it was urgent. It is urgent. I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday. Well, today's not my birthday. So Really? 'Cause I thought we had the same birthday. Happy birthday, Michael. Thanks. Am I on camera? Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. (HANGING UP) You can take a five if you want. Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday. Happy birthday. Thanks. Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out? They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion. Oh, okay. Second opinion on what? I might have skin cancer. Oh, no. I was watching Grey's Anatomy and there was a lifeguard on it, and he had skin cancer, too. Kelly, you know what I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's. Who brought in donuts? Somebody got donuts for my birthday. Happy birthday. You didn't know it was my birthday? I guess I forgot. Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut. Are you serious? Skin cancer is treatable. Right. It's gonna be okay. You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. It's probably nothing though. Hi. Delivery for Michael Scott. MICHAEL: Here we go. Okay, this is great. Thank you, my friends. She is perfect. Dwight, may I have your chair, please? And some singles if you will? All right. Okay. All right. This has arms. Is that gonna be a Is that all right? Sure. (LAUGHING) Okay. I'm so nervous. I can sign for it. Oh, thanks. When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids. And I got a really bad rash from the pony. And all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside. And my mother was rubbing cream on me for probably three hours and I never came outside. And by the time I got out, the pony was already in the truck and around the corner. So that was my worst birthday. Stop it! Stop! What is that? It's For The Longest Time by William Joel. Yeah. It's your favorite song. Yeah, when it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Apparently, my mother is the only one who cares enough to send me anything. I probably care more than she does. You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this. When does he hear? Sometime today. Poor Kevin. If I knew I had a week to live, I would probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. It would be a pretty busy week. That's a list price of $4.50. (WATCH ALARM BEEPING) Unfortunately, this item is on back-order. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Come here, come here, come here, come here. What? What? Listen up, everyone. It is 11:23 exactly. The exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal. So, huh? Right, have a seat please. Oh, God. There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair. Oh, no. So come over and help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin! Oh, no, no, no! I'll do it. Ryan, come on. DWIGHT: Creed. Let's do this. DWIGHT: Come on, Stanley, let's go! I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here? Maybe, but we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion and DWIGHT: On three, we're gonna hoist away. Ready? Okay. Happy birth moment, Michael. Thank you. One! Two! Three! Whoa, Whoa! Cut All right, all right, watch it please. DWIGHT: Oscar. It wasn't me. Okay, that is not an 8-foot sub. We don't make an 8-foot sub. This is eight 1-foot subs. F. All right, what's the damage? $39.60. $39. Sixty. Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food, I can drive a taxi, I can and do cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist. Because I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. Here they come. Get in here. Come and get it. Everybody, birthday party subs. My gift to you. OSCAR: What is this? Baloney, tomato and ketchup. The best. These are all the same. Yes. Baloney? I don't eat baloney. Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. It's still good. No. Just the bread. It's fresh-baked. No. Okay. Get whatever you want. And choke on it. When I was 16, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with. So she went out with him on my birthday. And she got him a cake at the restaurant, and it wasn't even his birthday. But I heard about it the next day in school. So, that was the worst birthday I think I ever had. So, we got Kev some stuff. Party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie. And he lent it to Creed, so I can guarantee you he won't get that back. Sixty-nine Cup of Noodles. Which we realize sounds crass, but it is his favorite number. And his favorite lunch. Hey, Temp, you know we still got five feet of sandwich left. Someone ate three feet of that thing? Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. Thank you. Oh, I got it. Wait. It's the Party Planning Committee. (WHISPERING) This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything. Fine. What about that meeting later to discuss finances? Yes. (WHISPERING) But don't expect any cookie. But what if I'm hungry? No cookie. What? You use fabric softener? Yeah. You don't? No, I do. Okay. ALL: Happy birthday dear Michael (CELL PHONE RINGING) Happy birthday to you Hello. Hey. Kevin, respect the birthday, please? No. No, not yet. I will. Goodbye. It was just Daisy. MICHAEL: Are you done? Good. Okay. I'm gonna Here we go. Make a wish. blow out the candles. Okay. (DWIGHT CHEERING EXCITEDLY) Yeah! I asked for trick candles. Pam was supposed to get them. Sorry. Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. Hello? What about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer. Oh, that sucks! Great. Wow, that's good timing. That's Sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible news for both of us. We should probably head back. Yeah, okay. Oh, I dare you to make an announcement. You dare me? How old are you? Just quit stalling. Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. Such a dork. Jim Halpert, price check on fabric softener. The kind with the cute Ma'am, please don't touch that. That is not a toy. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. How old are you? I hate you. Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is terrible. Here you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that fully recover. It's still scary. Yeah, but it's not brain cancer, and it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is? Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and Dacarbazine. And laughter also. I don't really think people are in the laughing mood. Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party. I work here. "I work here." All right. Well, you know what? Since Toby doesn't speak for everybody, and I am your boss, I think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day. If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy. Well, you're pretty much driving everybody else here crazy. Crazy with worry. Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, because I kicked in all the stalls. Well, that's an invasion of privacy, so I'm gonna tell Michael. Please, don't. You owe me. Excuse me, everyone. Attention, please. Kevin, we're gonna take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. Is this trip in any way related to your birthday? How dare you, sir. You are gross. That should not be there. I'll get someone to take it down. No, it's all right. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on, let's get our skate on! Don't be scared. You're good. You're good. JIM: I wanna go Think you can let go? No. (JIM EXCLAIMING) Okay. Yeah! Who's that? Was that Michael? Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but you're on the road so much. You get no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids. (GROWLING) (LAUGHING) I got it. Hey, Pam. All the stuff with Kevin is pretty scary. And I'm thinking that next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time-bags. All right? Think about it. It's something to think about. I just can't relax about it, you know? MICHAEL: Kevin! You heard anything yet? No, not yet. Okay. Well, live strong. Okay, Michael. All right. CAROL: Michael? Yeah. Carol? Yeah. She sold me my condo. Hey, what, is this place on the market or No, I don't just sell real estate. My daughter has a skating lesson. Oh, these all your kids? No, just the front two. Oh. Hey, guys. What's up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? Sure. Cool. All right, grab on. Here we go. You ready? Hang on tight. All right. We are moving. We are really moving now! (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) MICHAEL: Push. Good, that's great. You got it. Excuse me. Hello? Yeah, okay. All right. Okay, I will. Thanks. It's negative. Oh, God! We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna Come here. Well, apparently, in the medicine community, "negative" means "good," which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community that would be chaos. This is awesome. Thanks, you guys. Okay, who is this from? Wowee, look at that jersey! Turn it around. Turn it around. Cool. Show it. Great. "From Dwight. Number One." Thank you, Dwight. That's great. Thanks. Michael. Yeah. This is from all of us. Oh, you didn't need to do that. Night Swept. This is really amazing. Thank you. I love it. Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know. It was a good day.
DWIGHT: Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit. Okay, come on. Let's go. You look cute today, Dwight. Thanks, girl. So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot, which is unfortunate, because, as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs. Let's go over some of these symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like. Slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation. Hey. I like the people I work with, generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime, and I did not become a Lackawanna County volunteer sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't. (IMITATING STANLEY) I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip. (PAM LAUGHING) Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk, and he'll just be someone else. Like, he'll go That's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can. And the guys are saying, "Chug! Chug! Chug!" But I'm so small and all I had eaten that day was one of those Auntie Em pretzels from the food court. So I said, "Is it okay if I sip it?" And they said, "No." But Ryan seemed cool either way Stop! This is not "Kelly Kapour's Story Hour." Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is on the line! Now, I'm gonna ask you again, what time did you go home last night? I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night. I go to a lot of parties. Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me your keys. I am not giving you my keys. Don't make me do this the hard way. What's the hard way? I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant. Once he has said warrant, he will drive over here and make you give him the keys to your car and you will have to obey him. Yeah, let's do it that way. Dwight! Is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow. I can't stop this investigation. It is my job. Whoa, you are a volunteer. I volunteered for this job. And that's not the same. It is my duty Volunteer duty. to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go, and then I will reveal what I know. (COUGHING) Narc! (SNICKERING) If you are attempting to compliment me, then you have done a very good job. I wasn't attempting to compliment you. Well, you have, because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have. Okay. And I am very proud of being Why don't you just cool it? Cool it! So Dwight, please! God! (IMITATING STONER) Dude, where's my office? I totally lost it because I was half-baked, smoking doobies! Doobie Brothers. I was smoking doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! Well, your office is behind you. Thanks. Munchies. Who wants some munchies? I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone's ever offered him any. DWIGHT: Oscar visited Mexico, when he was five, to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule. Have you ever taken any illegal drugs? No, I have not. Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it? What are you implying? Have you ever pooped a balloon? Okay, I'm done with this. He sure left in a hurry. I don't wanna blow this. DWIGHT: This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of, the chance to solve an actual crime. DWIGHT: Do you know what this is? Yes, it's marijuana. How do you know that? It's labeled. Damn it. That is Northern Lights, Cannabis indica. (SIGHING) No. It's marijuana. I'm just saying that you can't be sure that it wasn't you. That's ridiculous. Of course it wasn't me. Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember. I would remember. Well, how could you if it just erased your memory? That's not how it works. Now, how do you know how it works? Knock it off, okay? I'm interviewing you. No! You said I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now, exactly how much pot did you smoke? So, Pam told me you do a great Stanley impression. I'd love to hear it. (HESITATING) OSCAR: Good. "Why do you keep cc-ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?" Is that supposed to be me? Oh, hey, Stanley. I was just doing an impression. I do not think that is funny. He does everyone in the office. Hmm. "I do not think that is funny." "I do not think that is funny." Jinx. Buy me a Coke. No, no! No talking! Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a Coke. Those are the rules of Jinx and they are unflinchingly rigid. "Sold out"? That has never happened in the history of Jinx. Sorry, it's not my problem. DWIGHT: I know you're innocent, but it can't look like I'm treating you any differently. I understand. (SHOUTING) Where were you yesterday after work? MICHAEL: Uh-oh, uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out! Narc! Narc! Kevin. That is so good, Michael. MICHAEL: Remember the narc bit? Okay, I will let them know. Uh-oh. Who's in trouble? Attention, everyone! Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine. (LAUGHING) What? What are you talking about? Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises, there is automatic drug testing conducted within 24 hours. Is that true, Toby? When you sign your job application, you agree to comply with random drug testing. MICHAEL: Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I had scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act, this beautiful girl sits down next to me. And I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened, but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said that it was clove cigarettes. And I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it. Okay, attention, everyone! The drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. No, you can't do that. I can do that. It is my office! DWIGHT: No, you cannot. It has to be official and it has to be urine. All right. Okay. Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking besides Rogaine? I'm not taking Rogaine. Angela, what about you? I don't take any prescription drugs. You're not on anything? Good. KELLY: So, the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine. But I was so nervous. So this time, I wanted it to be special. So I bought a new dress! One of those kinds that's kind of low-cut at the top to show something. But not everything. I mean, not everything, Jim. I promise Hey, guys. What's going on? We're just having the best conversation. Okay, well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. But you know what? We have a few minutes, so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. KELLY: Thanks. So, I was looking so hot It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about. We don't feel that way. No, not at all. You were the one joking around, calling Dwight a narc. No, no. That was a test. I was testing you. And you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what? He's right. "What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs." Thank you, Michael. I am ridiculously anti-drug. I am so anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion or testing of any kind. Drugs ruin lives, people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong. Everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny. But just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now, I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children. Where did you get these facts? Are these facts scaring you or are they not? They are not. Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool? STANLEY: No, I don't. And I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week, for the antioxidants. TOBY: Yeah, I have the same MICHAEL: Okay. Enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with? Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael. Yes, it is. No, it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit or other flavors Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, could you take this down? In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. You can't do that. I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. That's not random. Okay. Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam. I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs. MICHAEL: Really? PAM: Mmm-hmm. Jim, it's okay. You can This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It's okay. Just We will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he's doing it. Okay. It's okay. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was gonna be good. All right. Okay, well Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. I did not expect that. The point I'm trying to make with all of this, people, is that I hate drugs. I hate them! And based upon what I have seen, you all don't quite hate them as much as I do. So, you are going to have a drug test and I am not. No, you will be tested. Yes, I will Will not be. No, you will be. That is the law according to the rules. Okay, well, Dwight, just know that I've been very busy today and I've got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything's gonna come out. Okay? So, good. Thank you. Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy. We test a lot of urine. Mine was green. Oh, right. How are you? I'm all better. So, I need you to do some work on the Saint Andrews account. I need your urine, I need some filing done. What kind of filing? Just forget it. Just the urine. That goes directly to the tester. Just I need your urine. Like in a cup? Yes, in a cup. We're not animals, Dwight. For what purpose? It's none of your business. Then I refuse. Okay, all right, just I went to an Alicia Keys concert over the weekend. And I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. Are you serious? I need clean urine for the lady. (SIGHING) But that's illegal. Don't think of it that way. It's like urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just Not my urine. A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. We have Were you forced to do drugs at this concert? No, just Is something wrong? Look, just Just fill up the cup. Do you want to give Michael your urine? I want him to have all the urine he needs. You're not gonna get my permission on this. I know that. Don't you think I know that? Yeah, we do testing all over the country. Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring? You want to work at the urinalysis lab? Yeah. Maybe. (DWIGHT MOANING) My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name? Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little, my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot, but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. And I was shocked when I found out. What? Did you wanna tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. I'd like a magazine. We just need urine, sir. I'd still like one. MICHAEL: Dwight, well, I passed the test, thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. That's great. What's wrong? Where's your costume? It's a uniform. And I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation. Why? What I took an oath when I was sworn in. And I broke that oath today. Here. Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird. And I really wanna know what the hell's going on with Dwight. Hi. Hey. How much time do you have left on your break? Ten minutes. Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings, call in a few favors, and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch. Really? Yes, sir. That's fantastic. Because I've always felt that the security here sucked. So, you wanna "Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary volunteer corporal "in charge of assisting all activities' security." Okay. Here's your badge. Thank you, Michael. Very nice, great. Can I have a gun? No. I don't have a gun. Okay. I'll have to bring in my bo staff. I don't think so. Don't Good. Thank you, Michael. No I need to go over some details with you. All right. First of all Well, thank you. Hank. Okay. How many orange traffic cones do you have? Two. Oh, God. Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. JIM: Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of The Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
So have you found a band yet for your wedding? No. 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock. Yeah. I mean, it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet. So it evens out. Oh, I got the Save-the-Date. Yeah? Yeah. Pretty stationery. Oh, thanks. ANGELA: I didn't get mine yet. Oh. There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward, but it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy. Yes, thanks. Fantastic Sams, Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow-dry. We're doing ID photos today. Gotta represent. On or off? Off. Okay. Oh, what is on your face? Is that a disguise? Excuse me. Clown paint. ID badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged? MICHAEL: That's a nice tie. Thank you. That is Who makes that? I don't know. Do you mind if I wear that for the photo? Let's Let's keep our clothes. OSCAR: It's like child abuse! I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean, on so many levels! And I'm supposed to work there? I'm supposed to What's the dealio? Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there. What's the problem? Angela. There's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace. Since Christmas. So, what, you're having a little spat? I forget, are you guys dating? No. Michael, can I talk to you for a second, please? Yes. Here's how I usually handle this. All I do is listen, you know? These things just have a way of working themselves out. It's like if you write someone a letter when you're really angry, they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple of days and then you just never end up sending it. What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So Okay. Okay, what? That was the right decision for me and my marriage. Yeah. Well, that's not gonna fly here, because in this office it is till death do us part. Assuming that we don't get downsized. Pam, would you get Angela and meet us in the conference room, please? A "Mediators Toolchest." Okay. Well, before we get started, you should know that there are five different styles of conflict. (IN MOCK ASIAN ACCENT) My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style. Can we go? I have a lot of work to do. No. This is important. Okay. The first style is lose-Iose. What's the next one? Just hold on, please. Okay. If we do lose-Iose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You would both lose. Now, I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose-Iose negotiation? Can we just skip to whatever number five is, win-win or whatever. Win-win is number four. And number five is win-win-win. The important difference here is with win-win-win, we all win. Me, too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work. Okay. So this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings, using "l" emotion language, and no judging or "you" statements. I got this poster for Christmas and I feel I want to see it every day. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor. Come on. Seriously, that? I don't like looking at it. It's creepy and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who forced the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art, it destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hard-core porn. Okay, okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Stop. Let's see if we can't just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win-win. Win. Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win-win-win. No. That's No. Okay. Well, brainstorm. Own the solution. How about I leave it up? How about she takes it down? How about Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Okay. That is called a compromise. And it is style three, and it is not ideal. To sum up, win-win: Make the poster into a t-shirt. Win-Iose: Take the poster down. Compromise: Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is make the poster into a t-shirt. Win-win. Win. Fine. But It is done. No, you're all good. Great. PAM: Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code. Oh. Thanks. It was hand-delivered. But I did get a Save-the-Date after all. It's not my taste. You solved it? Yes. Well, good. We can throw that one out. Are those all the other complaints? Mmm-hmm. I would like to see those, please. I can't do that. You can't do that, huh? Okay. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file. That Okay. There. No more conflict. I had to use win-Iose on that. It was not pretty. All right. Is that it? It's all Dwight's. Every Friday at 4:00 I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York. Oh, God. All right. Why do I have to do everything? PHOTOGRAPHER: Are you sure? Oh, he's sure. Just shoot. This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed (MUTTERING) Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day, and wants a seat facing the receptionist. Nice. You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me. Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year. How many of you have, at one time, gone to Toby to complain about another employee? And did you get what you wanted? Or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem and you move on? ALL: (MUMBLING) Merely listened to and forgotten. That is outrageous. I love this place, and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering. Okay. Today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved. All right. How about the Phyllis-Angela dispute. You already did me. MICHAEL: That's what she said. The thing is, Angela, you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run-ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"? Yeah. It just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it. So, I just took their name off. Okay. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago. Wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago? Let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me? All right. Pamela! Come on down! Let's do it. And Okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next! Wait. What did it say? "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time?" "Shouldn't she do that at home?" MICHAEL: Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally. All right? PAM: I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her, and I haven't told anyone, and What the hell! Here is a Kelly complaint. "Ryan never returns my calls." Join the club. My voicemail's real spotty sometimes. I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking. To your HR representative. To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn. Fine. I'll take your name off so no one will know. Making progress. Yes? Dwight tried to kiss me. DWIGHT: What? And I didn't tell anyone 'cause I'm not really sure how I feel about it. That is not true. Redact it. Redact it. Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it. Okay. Question. When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York? Sure. MICHAEL: Stanley, you got a lot of anger under there, buddy Hey, thanks for ratting me out. I didn't do it. I find that hard to believe, considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe. Someone complained that the men's room is whites only. Stanley, you know that's not true. I didn't say that. Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door. Okay. Phyllis, you complained that Angela is giving you dirty looks and you tried to get off the party-planning committee. I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close. And, also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much and that that bugs him. Stanley and I are close, too. We sit close. MICHAEL: Okay. Just take it. I can't believe Angela. And I went against my better judgment and I gave her a Save-the-Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby. Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends. Don't take her side. Well, what does Roy think about everything? I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff. You mean, like your thoughts and feelings. Yeah. Yeah. I know you keep saying it's your space even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting. Yes, that's the problem. I guess so. Okay. Well, all settled then. I don't like you. Okay. Ryan, you told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell? I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious, but they smell like death. All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable. I accept your decision. Hey, you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo ID taken together. That doesn't make any sense. Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning, walk in together. Perfect. PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile. No. I never smile, if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life. This came out really well. There you go. This is humongous. I am not a security threat. And my middle name is Kurt, not fart. What did I write? I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file. Talk to Michael. I gave him the box. What box? I didn't report your snoring Over here. God, God, God! No! No! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand. Okay. Calm down. No, you calm down. Whose side is Toby on? Whose side are you on? Hey! Him or me? Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore. Either he goes or I go. Dwight. Stop. You choose! One of us is out of here by the end of today! Okay. I am not bluffing. Okay? Okay. Yes. Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay. I have served you loyally for years. I deserve this. You know I do. You know, your ID says you're a security threat. You have till 5:00. (CLEARING THROAT) DWIGHT: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer. Transfer. Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Okay, you two. In the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match. Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage. Okay. So, Dwight, in your own words, "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert. "Everyone has called me Dwayne all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to." Yes. 5 bucks each and it was totally worth it. "This morning I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer, "and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. "I think he may be the real murderer." "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the women's room. "When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gag. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone." JIM: That actually took a while. I had to put more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight. And then I just took them all out. "Every time I typed my name, it said diapers." Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny, one after another. But he does deserve it, though. "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." Yeah. I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day, that day. MICHAEL: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body very hard. And it is very painful and, apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful. Maybe Stamford would be cool. It's a good market. Higher volume. Yeah. Maybe we should both go. I have a girlfriend. Sure you do, Dwight. Sure. Hey. There's, like, Let's get to them later. So, are you going to transfer Jim or not? Maybe. I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work. I want an answer by tomorrow. Okay. Actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week? Fine. Good. Okay. Hey! Wait. How about a group picture, while you're here? I can't. I only get reimbursed for the ID photos. Well, it's a computer camera, right? You mean digital? Yeah. It'll take like two seconds. (SIGHING) All right. Everybody, come on! Group photo for the newsletter! You've gotta be kidding. MICHAEL: Come on, everybody. Come on. Let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar, andale! Let's go. One, two, three, smile. Try to smile. We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts. All right, I'm just gonna take it on three, whether you smile or not. One, two, three. Good. Let's check that out. (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) Okay. All right. One more. Take one more. That'll be another $20. What? Angela, I want to talk to you about something. What? No, Pam. I am. It's about the Save-the-Date. Pam, it wasn't her. What? I'm the one who complained about you. I didn't know that Toby was going to write it down. MICHAEL: Good. I was just venting. Check that out. You know, it was just It was one day. MICHAEL: That's terrible. I took it right back. It was just like Okay. Oh, dear. Okay. We can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. MICHAEL: It was really hard getting a good picture of 15 people. He would not give me a discount, and eight tries added up. One, two Didn't say "three," did I? But I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. Hey, Pam. It's Jim. I have a doctor's appointment in the city, so I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. Okay, Jan will see you now. Oh, thanks. MICHAEL: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches, sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something that Toby will never understand.
MICHAEL: Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just It's nice to know, at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo "has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good. (DOOR CLOSES) Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two? I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years. It's a nice tux. I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom. So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame. Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert. Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance. I can always kind of win at roulette. Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. How would you do that? Mind control. You can't be serious. Are you serious? Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind. I don't believe you. Continue. It was just little things, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things. That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead. Okay, I'll try. Oh, my God. I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing. JAN: Yeah, but Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee. Top 80%! Michael? Yeah? You know that I'm very serious here. Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam! What? Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. I thought that you were their fearless leader. I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez. (JAN LAUGHS) I think you can handle it. Oh, come on. Come on. I think so, Michael You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break. Goodbye, Michael. Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day. Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America. Again. We do that every year. Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts. It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering. Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge, compliments of Vance Refrigeration. DWIGHT: Yes. So, get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief. That doesn't exist anymore. Comedy's very much alive, as are homeless people. No, they stopped making that show. Well, then, they need our money more than ever. You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization. There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them. Something with animals. Or people. Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is so hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. Maybe he did it. We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity? Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going? Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS. Afghani. What? Afghani. That's a dog. No, that's Afghan. That's a shawl. Wait, canine AIDS? No. Humans with AIDS. Who has AIDS? Guys, the Afghanistananies. Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried. There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head. And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams. What are you doing? Oh, nothing. "Till Death Do Us Rock." They're wedding bands. Oh. Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now. Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. There's a KISS cover band in here. Let's do it. I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work. Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know. I have no future here. I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse. It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place. Except my warehouse. Well, actually, it's my warehouse. Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease. Why are you here? When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection. Not. I said, not that. We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen. That's ironic. What? That you are afraid. Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood? Dinkin flicka. Dinkin flicka. I taught Mike some phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out." "Going mach five." "Dinkin flicka." You know, things us Negroes say. Give me some. (BOTH WHOOPING) Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too. JIM: Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good. I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza. Yes. Have three stages, yeah. Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity. Oh. Let's take a look. Nice. Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums. What? On the drums! On the drums! Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer. We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band. Wow. Oh! Oh, my Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna No! No! No, Pam, you're gonna loose him to another wedding. No, come back! No, no, no! Kev! Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding. (PHONE RINGING) Yes? Michael, Carol Stills for you. Who? Carol Stills. Do I know a Carol Stills? Your realtor. Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey, Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good? It's still me. Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt. Carol, you're on with Michael. Hello, Michael? Hi, Carol. How you doing? I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance. Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place. Oh, great. Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped. Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later? Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night. Oh, great. Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink. To the casino thing? Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you What do you What? Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes? PAM: Michael, Jan's on line two. Okay, put her through. Jan Levinson, I presume? It's still me. Jan, here's Michael. Michael? Hey, Jan. How you doing? You know, I I thought about it and you are right. I am? I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night. Oh, okay. Incidentally, what is the charity? AIDS. Okay, then. I will see you tonight. Okay, sounds great. Bye-bye. Bye. Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just No problemo. Right. To answer your question. Yeah? Yes. What? I'd love to go. Okay. I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem. Problem. Good. And I'll bring the papers, too. Good. All right. Sounds great. I'll see you tonight. Bye. Bye. Two queens on Casino Night.

Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.

He's gone all-in. Okay, all right, whatever. Flip them. You really screwed that up. Wow. I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling. He asked the man a question. DWIGHT: I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs. I will raise. Thanks. It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds. Wow, bad luck. Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Michael? Jan. Hi. Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship. What are you Just Wait, what're you talking about? What does that mean?

You having fun? Fabulous time. I drove two and half hours to get here. Yeah, we all really Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed. Well, I think you look great. Why did I hook up with Michael? Yeah, why did you? It was very late, Jim. Very Very late and Have you given any more thought to the transfer? Oh, yeah. Good. Have you told anyone? No. Well, you should. Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin. Thanks.

Hey, can I talk to you about something? About when you want to give me more of your money? No, I Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight. I was just I'm in love with you. What? I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that? I just needed you to know. Once. Well, I I I can't. Yeah. You have no idea Don't do that. what your friendship means to me. Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be more than that. I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault. Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship. Hey. I'm leaving. Hey, okay. So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud. Thank you. And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks. Okay. Thanks for coming. Nice to meet you. You, too. And you guys have a good time together. Okay. Talk to you Monday. Yeah. Goodbye. Good night. She's a good boss. She seems really nice. Oh, she's great. Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So, actually, the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good. About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. I don't know, Mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am. I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's old job, which means at my 10-year high school reunion, it will not say, "Ryan Howard is a temp. " It will say, "Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate "at a mid-range paper supply firm. " That'll show them. You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. Me, too. I think we're just drunk. No, I'm not drunk. Are you drunk? No. Jim. You're really going to marry him? Okay. Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. I cry myself to sleep. Jim. False. I do not miss him. No. That is the fun of this place. I call everybody faggy. Why would anyone find that offensive? Okay. I think Oscar would just like it if you used lame or something like that. That's what faggy means. No, not really. Oh. Apparently you called Oscar faggy. Yeah. For liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie. It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard. All right, Michael, but Oscar's really gay. Exactly. I mean for real. Yeah, I know. No. He's attracted to other men. Okay. Little too far. Crossed the line. Okay. I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah. He told me this morning. And obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion. I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't call retarded people retards. It's bad taste. You call your friends retards when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend. Listen, man, I am so sorry. I had no idea. Oh, it's fine. It's okay. It's okay. No. No. It's okay. No, it's not. I just I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people faggy since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way. You know? I'm just I I can't even imagine the thing Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime and you could tell me how you do that to another dude. That sounds like a great, wonderful idea. Let's do that. It explains so much. No. I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think that I'm gay if Yeah, I'm gay. I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure you that it is certainly not more flammable. Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted. And you can't beat that view, right? Hey, Big Tuna, you're single, right? Yeah, I am. Pretty hot, huh? She's completely crazy. Steer clear, Big Tuna. Head for open waters. Okay. Okay. I ate a tuna sandwich on my first day, so Andy started calling me Big Tuna. I don't think any of them actually know my real name. Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know, cut your throat to get ahead type of guy. But, I mean, I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell. You ever heard of it? I graduated in four years, I never studied once, I was drunk the whole time and I sang in the a cappella group Here Comes Treble. So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy freshener because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business start-ups I got from the chamber. Yes. I am going to need someone to cold call them. Oh, I can do that. Jim's nice enough. I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera, like this. What is that? Can you tell who's gay and who is not? Of course. What about Oscar? Absolutely not. Well, he is. Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so There could be others. I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else. You could assume everyone is and not say anything offensive. Yeah. I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman. I really don't think so. I don't know. I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. Jim told me you could buy gaydar online. That's ridiculous. Yeah. Probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot. Let's call him and get the website. Definitely. What's gaydar? Oh, oh, gaydar, yes! No, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I can check for you. No problem. It's sold out. Yeah. Sorry about that. That's a bummer. They're sold out. Damn. I'll try Brookstone. I miss that. Chicken or fish? Chicken. So, you having a good day? Excellent. Thanks. Good. I'm glad. Okay. Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet a few days before, and I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food, so we froze it. But I'm doing well. I have my own apartment and I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks. After Pam dumped me, I kind of stopped taking care of myself for a while there, and I hit bottom when I had a drunk driving arrest. Yeah, I've been working out and, you know, I'm not going to take her for granted. I got to win her back. I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters. It is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you. Yes, I am super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company in Scranton. Much like Sir Ian McKellen. Sure, sometimes I watch Will & Grace and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. Is on. He's so talented. Okay, who put my calculator in JELL-O? Good one. But, seriously, guys, who did this? Seriously, guys. Who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in JELL-O or I'm going to lose my freaking mind! You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you can be so obtuse about sexual orientation. I watch The L Word, okay? Good. Good. I watch Queer as so That's not what it's called. Okay, Michael, are you aware that you outed Oscar today? What? What does that even Coming out is a significant moment for a gay person. And they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it. Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade. It's not, like, gay shame festival. All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and that's your fault. I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? No! Maybe. Is that what this is about? No. No. It's not possible. I don't Anything's possible. Okay, you know, imagine you were gay. Well, I'm not gay, Jan, and you should know that better than anybody. Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit, which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Yes. Do you understand? I know. The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. Am I the first gay man you ever knew? Trick question. 'Cause you can't always tell, so how would I know? Was that the right answer? Yup. Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer. Michael knows, Pam, okay? He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons. Okay. Nothing wrong with this stuff at all. This is fine. You know what? Gay porn, straight porn, it's all good. I don't particularly get into this but, you know what, I totally see the merit. And actually, it is quite beautiful. Oh, damn pop-ups. What are you doing? Watching some of your friends. This is stupid. Excuse me. Don't touch me! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop it! All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian or overweight, just get in here! Right now! Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up, it meant lame. And now it means a man who makes love to other men. We're all homos, Homo sapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are What?  people. I mean, anybody can be gay. Businessmen, like antique dealers, or hairdressers or accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here however you want to do it? Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you. Yes, I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now? I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the '60s, I made love to many, many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain, and it's possible a man slipped in. There would be no way of knowing. Who should be the judges and juries of our society? Judges and juries. Yes. That's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal under U.S. Law. I bet a lot of straight men wished that applied to them so they could go out there and have some torrid, unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right? That sounds great. Yeah, Dwight. I think all the other office gays should identify themselves or I will do it for them. No one else in this office is gay. What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine. I'm getting married to Bob Vance. You are? No way! Congratulations, Phyllis. When did you get that? That's great. Congratulations, Phyllis. That is great, and frankly, kind of amazing. See? Everybody has a chance. Thank you. But, still Phyllis, in college, did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do. No, and you knew me in high school. Of course, we all thought you were gay in high school. Right. And I take that as a compliment. Well, with your ties and your matching socks Well, I just like to look good, okay? So You sound pretty defensive, Michael. No. I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero! I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here. No. No. The only signal that I am sending is gay good! Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you've ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just I'd be waving that rainbow flag. I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life. You misunderstand Okay. All right You know what? Okay. Okay. I'm going to put my money where my mouth is. You ready? What are you doing? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch us, Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. No. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend. I'd rather not. And I just don't care who sees it. Doesn't bother me. Really, I really would rather not. Come here, friend. I'd really rather not. You're my friend. No! No! I don't want to touch you. Ever considered that? You're ignorant and insulting and small. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Michael, I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on. Come on. All right. I'm sorry I called you faggy. I know. I know. You're not faggy. I know you are. You're a good guy. You, too. Michael appears to be gay, too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend. You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. You don't I want you to watch this and I want you to burn this into your brains. I don't think we need to do this Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office, I want you to think about this. We don't need to. Yes, we do. What? I did it! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. See, I'm still here. We're all still here. Oh, come on, Dwight! Come on, man! We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature, but we can't lose the spirit of childlike wonder. What is love anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way? It is very easy for you to be a hero. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. I'm glad if today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But, you know what, even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. That's what she said. Or he said. Oh, there's Gil, Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows. I was going to quit, but Jan offered me a three-month, paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gil and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. "Hope this helps. Jim. " Nice. What are you doing? Don't be scared. It works. Oh, no.
Pam? Yeah? Did you see Oprah yesterday? No, I didn't. I I'm going to be a father. What was Oprah about? Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life, and that really inspired me. So I want you to look into see how much a little Chinese baby would cost. That's a really big decision. I know. Maybe you should wait before you adopt. Well Or not adopt. Just do it, okay? Roy's sister looked into it and the application alone costs $1,000. Well, find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay? You know, she also said the waiting list is, like, eight months. Eight months? Yeah. I don't even know if I want a baby in eight months. Probably won't. You know what, Pam? If in 10 years, I haven't had a baby and you haven't had a baby No, Michael. Twenty years. No, Michael. Thirty. Sure. It's a deal. All right, three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Mmm-hmm. Three packs of condoms. Yes. Fun jeans. Right there. Sign. Per diem. Guess where I am going? I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fuelled sex romp where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which'll be fun. Poor little guy has been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. Don't be mad, it is a business trip. But I don't understand. It's for managers. Monkey, I am an ARM, Assistant Regional Manager. I know! It's I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. Are you still there? Yes, monkey. Don't "monkey" me! You can't wait to get out of here, ARM! In the Martin family, we like to say, "Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly. " That's code for "Check out the slut. " What is Why are there flies in here? Oh, my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I'm so excited. You guys are gonna click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing? This. You look so pretty. Thank you. Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw, too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years. Probably shouldn't broadcast that. Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date, it gives him all the power. Sleep with who? Whom? Whom? Whom? My neighbor, Alan. They're going on a date tonight. Oh, wow! Oh, my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do? Be hilarious. Wear your wedding dress. It'd be a great icebreaker! And your veil. Yeah. Do it! I'll probably just wear this. Really? Okay, well, word of advice, unbutton that top button, let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim? Um "Um," okay. You got that? I got it. Write it down. I'll write it down. Um, um, um, um There's my girl. Noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train? That was per diem for Philadelphia. That town smells like cheese steaks. That town is full of history! Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. Creed. Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back? Hey, Michael. Hey, Josh, how you doing? Pretty good, how you doing? Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor. Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! The The progidal My son returns! I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like with firemen, you don't leave your brothers behind. Even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut. It's really good to see you, man. Yeah. Wow. I didn't expect that. It's good to see you, too. Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? Yeah, sold about 40,000. Hey! Shut up, that's impossible. No, it's not, and I did, yeah. Well, I did it, too. You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. So did you hear? What? Pam's back on the market again. Really? She's dating? If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that. So what kind of commissions you get up there? Oh, Dwight, I missed you so much. You're so immature. Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman, and I just wanted to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm gonna look for a place for you in Stamford. Oh, hey! Hey. Hey, Jan. We all checked in? Yes. Great. Let's dump our stuff and meet back down here in half an hour. Okay. Okay. Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules. What are you talking about? The 800-pound gorilla in the room. Carole? I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention. Step away from me, Michael. Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you. Alan's cartoon's so funny, right? And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. This party is gonna be awesome! I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. Check it out. That is crooked. On that side. Wow. Hey, hey! That is a lot of liquor. Yeah. And a dartboard. Well, that's how we do it in Scranton, or did you forget? Ain't no party like a Scranton party 'cause a Scranton party don't stop! We should probably head on down, you know, hook up with Jan. Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen? "A shot of Midori, perhaps?" Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender in Stamford who You know what? You just had to be there. I wish I was! I love inside jokes. Love to be a part of one someday. We should Yeah! All right, see you guys down there. See you guys. All right. Change your mind, come back up. I'll do a shot with you, Michael. Don't be gross. It's not even lunch yet. Swag! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my swag! Check it out! Oh, my God. Hi! I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. All right. I'm a huge fan. Thanks, appreciate it, guys. You know what? I'm having a big blowout tonight, Room 308, hope you can come. All right, maybe. If I can. Well, cool! Okay, so can I tell people you're gonna be there? No, you cannot. So maybe. See you. Why do they call him "The Bus"? Because he's afraid to fly. Smile! Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308. Can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight! Be there! All right, Jan just e-mailed me. She wants us to meet her up front. Yup! Yeah, she's up front. You don't have e-mail on your phone. I don't have to, I just know. Yes? Hello? No one just called you. All right. Nice meeting you. Take care. Nice to meet you. I'll see you soon. Yeah, stop by. Take care. See you in a bit. Bye-bye. May I have a moment of your time, please? I need you to do something for me. Yes, anything. I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh, find out if there are any skeletons in his attic. I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat. Hey, Pam. Hey, what's up? It's How are I might ask if you wanted Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You, too. Sorry, what's up? Lf I just completely forgot what I was gonna say. It's so weird. Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here. Okay. So I called my buddy down at the station today to have him run a background check on Josh Porter, see if there's any known aliases, etcetera. And? He wasn't volunteering today. Yeah. Things have been pretty crazy around the office. Oh, yeah? Yeah. We moved Ryan over to your desk Tell him I say hi. I will call him later with that message. Hey, how's Toby? Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left? Oh, no, it was just, you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically. Michael, it's really not a competition. Jim got us a great lead with the new rep from National Envelope. - Really? Great. - We can grab lunch with him tomorrow. Hey, Jan? Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip. Whoa, Michael! Wow! Oh, my God, thank you! Hey, no problem. Was that your per diem? No, that was a different $100 bill. What have you generated, Michael? I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening. What party? The party I'm having tonight in 308, obviously, you are invited. Michael, Jim and Josh are in meetings all day, and I am in and out of meetings. I I can't stay on top of you 24l7. You should order the most expensive thing on the menu. So he knows you're worth it. If you do that, you're gonna have to put out. Oh, yeah, you'll have to put out. Is there a key for a Jane Doe? Thank you. Any messages for 308? All right. Hey, hey, fellers. Michael! Hey, Michael! What's up? Well, Jim and I have a meeting with uni-ball in about 45 minutes, so we should probably go now. Hey, check this out! How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton. I don't think so I don't really Jim, looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend. Fine, all right. Okay! Excellent. Do the wing flaps. Oh, just shut it. Hey, Pam, what's up? Yeah. No, tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. Say hi to Pam! Hi, Pam! Hi, Pam. Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. Pam says hi. Have fun on your date. Very good, talk to you later. Bye. You first! Come on. Nice try, Josh! Not. Hit the Hit the rim. Okay, and Okay, double or nothing. On what? We didn't bet anything, Michael, we Well, we Let's You know, we should go. We gotta go. Come on. Come on! We'll do it later. Let's go Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line? Fine. Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well Phooey on that. I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work. That is so true. Ready? Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for. Great. Sorry, my meeting ran late. Really? Yes, Jan, really, with the rep from Hammermill. They're exclusive with Staples. Used to be. Evan'll call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell Hammermill products. Yes! Well, Michael, I just I underestimated you. Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. Dwight's room key. And Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard. D? Oh, my God! Dwight got a hooker! Oh, my God, I gotta call Well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker! So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day. Oh, great. I don't like ketchup. You love ketchup! He loves ketchup. So how do you come up with your cartoons? Oh, I just I kind of think about stuff that I see. Or dream them. You dream in cartoons? How fun. Hey! First guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend. I thought there was a party in here. This is the party. This is Room 308? Party central! So what can I do you for? All right. See, this one is great because it could work on a couple different levels. "More freedom fries for the table?" "Freedom fries". Yeah. Yeah, I mean, people always say, like, "Don't be edgy," but I don't know I don't know any other way. Yeah, you got it. Well, it was It was really nice meeting you, Alan. Yeah, next time bring some of your illustrations. I'll let you pick my brain. "More freedom fries"! Yeah! That's great. Okay. I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection. I think when I like someone again, I'll just kind of know. Michael. Am I the first to arrive? People have been filtering in and out. Can I get a drink? What? Can I get a drink? Sure. Do you like Cosmos? Yeah, sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? Michael I get it! Did I do something or No. No, I totally get it! He made a better paper airplane, Stamford does better in sales. You I get it, we had some fun. We had some laughs Wait, wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss. I'm not better than Josh. Michael, it's not about I transferred because of Pam. Oh, my God. You don't even know. She's single now. No, I I heard something about that. It's just I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice. I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry, it's Hey, you know what? I will talk to her. Nope, that's okay. Yeah. No, that's all right. I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy, I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling, just Yeah. Okay, maybe. Are we early? Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out. Hey. Evan, this is Jim. How are you? Hey, Arnie Rissman, Michael, Jim. Hey, Arnie, how you doing? You guys work together? No, we used to. Yeah. Now we're friends. Best friends. Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular!" But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know, because a real relationship, it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly. Now would you do me the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? What are all those stains? Blood, urine, or semen. Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
I'm hungry. Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is Varsity Blues. Let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Take a seat down there. Second from the end. All right. Everybody here? Yes! Popcorn, anyone? Yes, please! Thank you. Anyone else? No. Movie Monday started with training videos. But we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half-hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times. Entourage. Kevin? Would you like to do the scenes from last week? Yes. Why him? Don't whine. Get the windows. Previously on Varsity Blues Okay, Billy Bob got a head injury, but Coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked and he's out for the year. Hello? Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who. I don't approve. I don't. Hello? Let's go after that title now. Let's go, let's go! Let's go! Hi, Jan. Hope you brought the Milk Duds. How would a movie increase productivity, Michael? How on Earth would it do that? People work faster after. Magically? No. They have to, to make up for the time they lost watching the movie. No. Do I need to hire a babysitter for you, Michael? Kitchen. Some little 14-year old girl whose job it is, is to limit Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. That's not going to happen. You know she has it out for him now! That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart. Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carole, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman, and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms. Dwight, you should be running this office. Michael would never let me. It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. I could never do that. Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired. I know that patience and loyalty are good and virtuous traits, but sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II videogame called Call of Duty. And they're all really into it. I'm told that it started as a teambuilding exercise. Unfortunately, I really suck at it. We didn't play many videogames in Scranton. Instead, we'd do stuff like Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high-pitched note and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And Pam called it Pretendonitis. Hey, Kelly, my stuff just got here. Oh! Oh, my God! Kelly really likes to online shop. So, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just I wanted to It's just, I felt like it was time to maybe, just get new clothes. Okay. I love it! Really? I don't know. No, you haven't even tried it on yet. Try it on. Not at work. I'll try it on Fashion show. Fashion show at lunch! No Fashion show, fashion show at lunch. Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Why did you do that? I'm just killing Germans any way I can. We're on the German team. Shoot the British. Wait, are we playing teams? Yeah. Hello? Is this Jan? Who is this? This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter. You should talk to Michael and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. It's about Michael. What about him? I can't talk here. It's too sensitive. It's not about a surprise party, is it? No, but we should discuss that another time. Look, I'm already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. Pull over at Exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop until I can meet you. How do you know I like that store? Many of your blouses are Claibornes. How do you know that? It's part of my job. No, it's not. It's officially not. Noted. I'm going to the dentist. Okay. I have to have an emergency crown put in. Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone three hours. Three hours? Wow! Have fun. Did you get anything good? Yeah. New blouse? Halter-top? Camisole? Teddy? I could save the branch. Really? If you let me run it. Okay. Okay, I can run it? What would you do differently? Mostly get rid of waste, which is half the people there. And clean house. Right here, it's all for me. Thank you. Dwight, you must feel strongly to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So, here we are. It's all on the table. I want the branch. And I await your decision. Oh, by the way, there's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings. Where is it? Michael! Hi. I had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees. Oh, that's nice. No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you. What? You were at the dentist? You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately. Okay. What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover-ish. Wow! It's so sexy! You look so hot. It's really something. It's too much. What? I'm gonna return it. No. You have to keep it today, just see how you feel. Hey. Hi. You look nice. Thanks. Isn't that, like, your third soda today? Yeah, I think we can be a big help to your company. Okay, see you next week. Bye. Again? Scared? Call of Duty. Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute? Now? Yes, now. Put the game on hold, everyone. This is not working, okay? We are getting slaughtered out there. It's the new guy. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know what we're talking about. See what I mean? We just need a strategy, okay? We're gonna set up a trap in the gunroom. All right? Jim, are you using the MP40 or the. 44? Sniper rifle? Snipe What? Jim! In Carentan? Are you playing for the other team? You don't snipe in Carentan, okay? It's saboteur! Saboteur! Andy, it's not I'm gonna kill you for real. This game, the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. Hey, Dwight. Hey. Do you want an M&M? No, thanks. I'm stuffed. No, seriously, you should have an M&M, they're really good. Okay. Good, huh? So good. Hey, I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple of hours after you've had a crown put in. They have this new kind of quick-drying bonding. So Sounds like a good dentist. Oh, yeah. What's his name? Crentist. Your dentist's name is Crentist? Yeah. Sounds a lot like dentist. Maybe that's why he became a dentist. Let me see your teeth. Let me see them. Let me see them. You should floss them. I know. Well, then. I'm glad you're okay. Business is like a jungle. And I am like a tiger. And Dwight is like a monkey that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? Pun. There's no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology. Dwight, can I talk to you for a second? Wow. This is tough! What? What is it? Well I just got off the phone with Jan. And She demoted me. No. Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job. And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I can't believe this news. That Wow! Yeah. I told her I didn't know whether you'd want to do it because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally. You said that? Yup, I did. I did. But I think you should do it. Well, gosh, if you think I should then I will. Perfect. Well, we're settled. All right. All right. Well, then you are now Acting Manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton branch, and I am Assistant Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. Thank you, Michael, for staying on, I really appreciate it. Oh Hey, hey. I can't imagine this place without you. Can't you? That's so nice. Well, I guess we should go tell the troops. Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. Okay, let's do it. Hey, hi, hello, everybody. I have some good news and I have some bad news. I am being replaced as your leader by Dwight. You're kidding. You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. Congratulations, Dwight. Thank you, Angela. But, why Dwight? Because Dwight never lies. How does that qualify him to run a branch? Because that's all it takes. Okay, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody about loyalty? Thank you, Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black with ferocity! Michael? What will you do? Oh, I'll be fine. Do you have any savings? No, no, I don't. But Michael, you might lose your condo. I won't. I won't. I have this little old vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. Maybe I'll quit. It's really happening. Yes. We can make a difference here. I will make a difference here. You alone? 'Cause I thought together we were Oh, please! Don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women. Look how cute he is. And he's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade. I'm sorry, what are you whispering about me? No, nothing. Just concentrate on turning around. Yeah, I'm trying, I just Just tap "S" then "D." Oh. Any last words? No? What? Wow! Psychopath. What? I'm just looking. Please go back to your desk. In a minute. Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll just be cool to have some after-work clothes that aren't pajamas. Well, I guess it's time that I turn over the keys to the famous Sebring. No, thank you. It's a corporate lease, Dwight, you've earned it. No, thanks. What? Not my style. But you said you liked it. You've always admired it. And But that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible is a ridiculous choice for this climate. Take it back. No. That's my car. What did you That's my car! Yes. I know, Dwight, I know. I know, I know. You know what? Jan called me about your little meeting! No. I know what you did. You The Sebring's cool I made the whole thing up, Dwight! It's cool, the Sebring's cool Oh, do you? Do you like it? And has a cassette and a CD. How dare you? How dare you, Dwight? Don't fire me. Please, don't Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you right here on the spot? I have excellent sales numbers! Not good enough! I'll do anything! Anything! Please, I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year! I have a laundry machine! I'm sorry. Anything I'II Please? Please? I don't know if I can trust you anymore. You can't. You can't, but I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? You can get up. What? Get up. And you can hug it out, bitch. "Hug it out, bitch. " That is what men say to each other after a fight. They hug it out. And in doing so, they just let it go. And walk away, and they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman, however, I have found. Doesn't translate. Yup, yup, we hugged it out. But it turns out I was still a little angry and so I felt I needed to punish him just a little bit more. And I'm making him do my laundry for a year.
Hey, Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse? Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. Well, it's okay. I'm going down. Yeah. Absolutely. All right, I'll be right back. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Michael, could you get me a pen from down in the warehouse? Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. Okay! There you go, fresh from the warehouse. Hey, Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse? There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam. But the warehouse coffee tastes so much better. Yeah. It's better. Okay. Great. All right, okay. I am like Bette Midler in For The Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained. With cream and sugar? All right. So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck. Okay, let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan, or does somebody miss me? Michael, Ed died over the weekend. Oh, wow. Attention, everybody! I just received a call from corporate with some news that they felt that I should know first. My old boss, Ed Truck, has died. Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news. You must feel so sad. Yes, I am. It's very sad, because he was my boss. Oh, that's a shame. Ed was a good guy. That's right. You worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by, cheer me up. So, did you hear the news? The news that you just announced, that Ed died? Yeah. Is there anything I can do? Oh, gosh. What can anybody do, really? It's He was almost 70. Circle of life. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. What's going on with Fairfield County Schools? Karen, did you generate that price list? Shoot. I will. I'm sorry. Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure? Oh, yeah, definitely. Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said? Thank you, everyone. Damn it. What's up? Oh, nothing. We're just out of Herr's chips. Oh. But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. That's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So I think we should go get some. Now, please. It's a real shame about Ed, huh? Yeah. Must really have you thinking. About what? The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that. Ed was decapitated. What? Really? He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6, he slides under an eighteen-wheeler, pop, it snaps right off. Oh, my God. That is the way to go. Instant death, very smart. You know, a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated. You're thinking of a chicken. What did I say? That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue. Not even have his own head to comfort him. So I'm not exactly sure how to say this Ed was decapitated. What are you doing? You said you didn't know how to say it. I didn't He was driving on the road and he went under a truck and that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. Now, we'll let you know more as soon as I find out. Hey. Hi. If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. I do not want to talk about this. When I die, I want to be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better, now that I know what hold he had me in. I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here. I understand how you feel, Michael, I really do. So would it be helpful to give everyone the day off? You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want, is a day off. Well, what would you suggest? A statue. Of Ed? Yeah. I'm not sure that's realistic. Well, I think it would be very realistic. It would look just like him. No, that's not We could have his eyes light up. Could have his arms move. That is not a statue. That is a robot. I think that is a great way to honor Ed. And how big do you want this robot? Life-size. No. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us. What the hell are you two talking about? Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan. You know what, Michael, I have really tried with you today and I have to get back to work. Oh, do you? So You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck. So call me when you feel like But Ed Truck can't having a real conversation. Goodbye.  because he is dead! Look, I gave him a 6- foot extension cord so he can't chase us. That's perfect. Okay, that is a "no" on the West Side Market. Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now? Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter. I am not a quitter. I will do this all day if you want. Really? I don't know about that. Yeah, all day. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in. Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen. Did you check the vending machine? Oh, the vending machines. How did we miss that? I have no idea. We went right for the copier. And then we checked the fax machine. Yeah, nothing there. Did you check your butt? Can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam. Okay, that's enough. What? We do not want to hear about this. Well, you know what? I didn't want to hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home His cappa is detated from his head. You have just spit on my face. Well, you know what, there's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here because we have lost a member of our family and you don't want to talk about it. You don't want to think about it, you just want to get back to work. There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And right now, out there, they are all denying the fact that they're sad, and that's hard, and it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance and, if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job. I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special, who died, and then I want you to say how they died. And you may cry if you like. That is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck and it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears. And, at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer. And then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone. And I'm crying, and nobody can hear me because I am terribly, terribly, terribly alone. Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. Okay, fine, hurry back. There's nothing wrong with your car. Just thought you might want a break from the grief counseling session. Oh, I would like a break. How are you liking the new car? Great. Yeah? It sure is small. Got air bags? I think so. I don't know. I was mainly focused on the cup-holders. Well, you still aren't driving so fast, are you? Yeah. Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we had a shipment of Herr's Salt & Vinegar Chips and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't Yeah. You have them in the warehouse? Great. What is my store number? Six. What? No. I'll call you back. Shut up. Six? Okay, we can start. You waited for me? Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family, so we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you want to give it a shot? I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissues made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else? Nope. Oh, yes, Stanley, come on. Your turn. You have to go. I will not. Okay, I'm going to toss the ball to Pam. Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die. Wow. If you want to cry, that's okay. Thanks. A few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa, and my cousin, Mufasa, was He was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests, and we all took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened. Do you want to talk about it any more? Oh, it would probably take me, like, an hour and a half to tell that whole story. Me, me. Me, me, me. Me, me. Yes. Okay. I was trying to throw this party once, and everyone was over for the weekend, and then my Uncle Bernie died. And so, me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. Do you think that this is a game? Well, there is a ball All right. We're starting over. No, I'm done. You are not leaving! No, we are not done! We really have a lot of work to do. Yeah, well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died and nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. Michael, look, I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die and I had to keep going How do you know? What? That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing? It was obvious. Was its heart beating? Toby, did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian! You don't know anything! Michael! Michael? Michael. Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come on. Poor little fella. Oh, shoot! He's a goner. No, he's not. Yeah. No, he's not. Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria! No! You can't get diseases from a bird! A dead bird should not be in the kitchen. We don't know if it's dead. No. That thing is dead. You want me to flush him? Attention, everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4:00 p. m. We will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird. I have a lot of work to do. Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith, but that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird and now we are going to honor it. But No! No! No! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. Find a box for him. I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. Nice. Nope. Sounded good. Thanks. It's okay. It's okay. Yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show. I mean, how many times do I have to confirm plans with Ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight? God! What are What are you doing? What? No, this is about the right size. No, God, no! It's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak? I'm sorry. I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute. I need a box, I need a box. A small box. Not too confining. Is it for the bird? Yeah. I have it covered. Oh, thank you. If you want to do something for the funeral. Yes, please. Maybe you could play a song on your recorder? Excellent. Do you have it with you? Always. Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into. Where'd you find them? Where'd I find what? I called the manufacturer, who referred me to the distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door. Glad you could all make it. You told us we had to. Dwight, do you have the box? Actually, I have it. You made this? Wow. That's That's very nice. When I was five, my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back, so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking, "I'm a little too old for this. " And I was five. I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. Yes. What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much, it's just a bird. " But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. I remember that. That was so funny. And we know how he died, flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. It's not a songbird. An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course we all know that doesn't mean he was alone, because I am sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten. Amen. Just smile for me and let the day begin You are the sunshine that lights my heart within Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There's such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. Let's get back to work. Guys, get a broom, let's clean this up. Grab a broom, you heard me. Mush!
Brain teaser. I have two coins, totaling 15 cents. One of them is not a nickel. What are they? A dime and a nickel. No. I said one of them is not a nickel. But the other one is. I've heard that before. Okay. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, "There is no way I can operate on this boy " "Because he's my son. " The doctor is the boy's mother. A man is found hanging from the ceiling He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself and the ice melted. A hunter It's a polar bear, because you're at the North Pole. Damn it! Tell me what you did yesterday. Nothing. Nothing? Yeah, nothing. How was your day? I don't care how your day was, Michael. Wow. Well, okay. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that? Tell me what you did yesterday. I worked. And then I went home to my condo, and Carole came over and we had sex. Is that what you want to hear? Never, ever, ever sleep with your boss. I'm so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base. Hi, Pam. Hi. I'm great. So, Pam, I'd like you to keep a log of everything Michael does, hour-by-hour, so that we can analyze it at corporate, okay? I don't know if I'm Thanks, Pam. It's weird. Jan used to treat Michael like he was a 10-year old. But lately it's like he's five. So, you excited? Yeah. Very excited? Yes, I'm very excited. Extremely excited? Just very? That's cool. I have spent a year here. And I have to commit or get out. So, Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, I'm excited. I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet. But more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he gonna be a slacker, loser, wise-ass like Jim was, or is he gonna join the Dwight Army of Champions? So, what if they're not talking much? Then does it make sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? So where is the sales office? When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now. Hey. What? My chair's squeaking. Is it? You took my chair. No, I didn't. I took back the chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair. When you get up, I'm just gonna take it back anyway, so So I guess I can't get up? Hey, Coselli. The Cos, Cosby. Hey, hey, hey! I love Jell-O Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jell-O Pudding Pops, too. Do you know where we are, temp? I know where we're not. I hold in my hand a beet seed. Take it. When you Damn it. Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Can you stand up and talk to me over there? That's it? That's what you came up with? I am acting my heart out here. Really? Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped. Attention, Scranton Business Park. There will be complimentary pretzels available in the lobby from now until 4:00, as a thank you to our loyal tenants. Once a year, they bring in a little cart, and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is. Productivity is important, but how can I be productive, if I have this one little thing in my brain that I cannot get out? And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So, I'm just gonna have my soft pretzel, I'll get to work and I'm gonna be super-productive. Look out for me! Oh, come on. And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I am going to plant my seed in you. I don't think you know what you're saying. It smells pretty bad, doesn't it? Uh-huh. It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. Gotcha. Oh, hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back. Okay. Of course. I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive. And then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little. But, on pretzel day Well, I like pretzel day. 'Cause they were acting all tough and everything, Uh-huh. But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and The Chronicles of Narnia. God, who invented cupcakes, right? I don't know I want to kill them. Hey, Phyllis, what are you doing? I'm just saying hi to Bob. No, I think you're cutting in line. Well, settle down, Scott. No, I'm not gonna settle down. No way. Uh-uh. Get in the back, please. Boo! Boo! Back in line. Thank you. That's right. What a pair of marys. This is pretzel day. Hey, Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you kneel in cow manure and I'll abandon you in a beet field. Oh, that sounds great, Dwight. I really appreciate that. Thank you so much. A mentor Congratulations, resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute farm! Love me, love me Say that you love me Fool me, fool me Stop. Go on and fool me Love me, love me Say that you love me This is not fair. It's gonna be in my head all day. Please. Fool me, fool me Go on and fool me Love me, love me Say that you love me This is not a proportionate response. Fool me, fool me Go on and fool me I don't care about anything but you Whatever happened to those guys? Michael. No cuts. Oh, Pam, just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind Great, I thought you might want to use this time to authorize some checks. I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom? You're an angel. Hey, why don't you just go up to your office and get some work done and I'll bring you a pretzel? Because I like them a certain way and if it gets screwed up then this whole thing's blown. You know, I just think that it's really important that you be productive today. Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back. It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long, lonely walk of loneliness Look, man, I was in a frat in college, so I know what you're doing. I get it. You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? 'Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? Yeah. Come on! Thank you. Hi, please tell me you have a sweet pretzel left. We do. Thank God. And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&Ms, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallows, nuts, toffee nuts, coconut, peanut butter drizzle, Oreo, sprinkles, cotton candy bits and powdered sugar. Is there any way that you could do all of them? The works. You got it. All right! Thank you. Please be seated. What was that? Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. Is that your cousin Mose? Yes. Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today, in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore. What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin? Outsourcing and consolidation of competition. Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide? Depression? Wrong. He hated himself. What is the Dharma Initiative? I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be? Sales take a long time. Oh, my God, I'm so worried. I'm sure Dwight will protect him. I don't know, Dwight's so weird. He's not weird, he's just individualistic. No, he's a freak. You're a freak! Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear? Loneliness. Maybe women. Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose! No. Okay. It's over, this is over. Okay? All right, wrestle him to the ground! No. You're a freak. No, just It's the final I'm not doing this anymore. It's part of the challenge. This is over. Goodbye. Ryan, don't Ryan, you don't have to wrestle him. Ryan, just get in the coffin. Ryan? Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice. Where are all the animals? Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry, too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat-back bacon, and look, something he whittled. Are you still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams. Look, that's not what I wanted, okay? I just wanted to go on a sales call. Oh, screw gun, the sales call! Hey! Hey! Mr. Coselli? Hey, hey, hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal? Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their heads. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. 'Cause you say the word "please" too much. Wait, can you go back Michael always says, "K- I-S-S." "Keep It Simple Stupid," great advice, hurts my feelings every time. Okay, I'm going to establish time frames. Good. I'm gonna put everything in terms of real dollars. Right. I'm gonna ask a lot of questions that all have positive answers. Then I can say, "That would be better" or, "We would like that. " That sort of thing. Exactly, yeah. That's good. I am going to try to be confident but not cocky. Oh, hey everyone! I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second, I Second? Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. Account Michael, what is going on? And I will be taking questions. Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael? What's on your suit? Caramel dip. But, one question at a time, please. Phyllis, Stanley, I want you to switch desks. I am going to re-organize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything. I think we're getting a lot done, don't you, on paper at least? And we are, after all, a paper company, are we not? Are we not? Are we not? Are you with me? Are you with me? Thank you very much. They really didn't like me. They did not. But they didn't have to say it to your face. I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong. Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're gonna be screwed once this whole Internet fad is over. What are you doing? Oh, no, no, no! No! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp, yeah! Come on! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin! Come on, drive! You drive! Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi, Jim. He's on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jim. Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. I think about that all the time. Good night, Pam. Night. Hey, what time is it? Twenty past five. A.M. Or P.M. P.M. Oh, good. These came for you, contracts, Frank Coselli. Oh, Coselli, with the Jell-O. This is a huge sale. Yes, right, good. Night, Michael. Good night. Dunder Mifflin. Hey. Oh, my God. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing. And I was just gonna go through the system 'cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why are you still there? I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. Oh, wow! Do you think you could send me a copy of that? Yeah, totally. So So Do you Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, I Everything's pretty much the same here. Oh, good. A little different. What time is it there? What time is it here? We're in the same time zone. Yeah, right. How far away did you think we were? I don't know. It felt far. Yeah, I have a question for you. What? How many words per minute does the average person type? I type 90. Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90. It's true. Okay, I said "average. " Seventy? How many do you type? Forget it. I was just about to brag. Forget it. Come on. Tell me. No. No. You have to tell me now. Sixty-five. Okay, no need to laugh. No, that's respectable. Respectable? So, okay, I'm watching the movie, by myself. Right. Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home. Okay. And I'm freaking out. Yeah. That movie is so scary. I know. But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up. No way! How do you confuse Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box. No, you're making this up. Would I make that up? Yes. Fancy new Beesly would make that up. New apartment, new stories Oh, yeah, my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom and a closet. And how many kitchens? I have one kitchen. Well, you got totally taken for a ride, Beesly. It's actually Most apartments these days have like three Three kitchens? Yes. How are you gonna cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? Hey, Ryan, are you okay? Pam? Yeah. Yeah. Pam? Okay, bye! Oh, yeah, I should probably go, too Oh, no, I was I don't know what Do you have to go? Yeah No, I should probably go, too. Okay. I mean Yeah. Yeah. Bye, Pam. Bye, Jim. Three hundred, sixty-four days till the next pretzel day.
There you go. Nice dress, Ryan. It's not a dress, it's a kurta. Okay. Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it, "It's I have It's so super fun and it's gonna be great. " A lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that it's essentially a Hindu Halloween. You look so handsome. You really do. I love the material. I know. How come you didn't get me one? Okay. So, between Meredith's minivan and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about 12 people. I actually might not go. I'm feeling kind of tired. Do you want to make Appletinis and watch Sex and the City at my place? Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends. I just feel kind of tired, you know? Maybe you've got mono. Maybe. I just I don't really have anyone to go with. Well, go with Dwight. He's single too, right? Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight? I don't know. Who's Who's going? Oh, you mean like, "Is Pam going?" Don't go. They eat monkey brains. Hey, hey, hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do, sign me up because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley, come Kwanza time, I have got you covered, baby. I don't celebrate Kwanza. Really? You should. It's fun. I love the people here. And if there was one thing I don't really care for, is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carole. Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly, you are on! Diwali is awesome and there's food and there's gonna be dancing, and I got the raddest outfit. Kelly? It has sparkles Why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday? Oh, I don't know. It's really old, I think. How many gods do you have? Like hundreds, I think, maybe more. I don't know. And that blue, busty gal, what's her story? She looks like Pam from the neck down. Pam wishes. Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a celebration of the coronation of the God-king Rama after his epic battle with Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle All right between good and evil  all right. This isn't Lord of the Rings. Here we are. I'm sorry. I started biking to work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape, helps the environment and now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. Nice basket. Thank you. Now a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true, because frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from The Simpsons. Hilarious Indian. M. Night Shyamalan, The Village, Unbreakable, Sixth Sense "I see dead people. " Okay. Spoiler alert. He was dead the whole time. Just stop it. What's Oh, what? Where did that come from? Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny little arms. Oh. Did you shake it? Yeah, I shook it, I shook it. We have such a roller-coaster thing, Karen and I. Excuse me? Roller-coastery friendship. Hot and cold, on again, off again, sexual tension-filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. Wow. Yeah? From Cheers. Yeah. And another thing about the Indian people, they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean, look at that. Who has seen that before? I have, that's Union of the Monkey. Oh, that's what they call it. This is the best meeting we have ever had. Thank you, Kevin. You know, I find this incredibly offensive. Well, I find it beautiful. Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine, but we shouldn't all be subjected to it. No. Actually, she's right. This is inappropriate. Why don't I take these? No, you're not going to collect them. Yeah. No, this is a delightful, charming culture. My Indian cultural seminar was going great until Toby decided he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex, people, everybody does it. I'm doing it with Carole probably tonight. All right, I think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner. Thanks. Now, Karen, let's keep it to $20 a person this time. Got it. Okay. Once a quarter, the sales staff of this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds. You guys ready to party? What's that? I said, "Are you ready to party!" Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? I wish some of us still had our shoes on. Stop it. It's a disease. I told you. I thought you said this was a costume party. What does that look like to you? An Indian woman in a sari. No one's even gonna notice. Nice outfit. Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. So you can just cool it, okay? Carole? Carole I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now these are limes, lemons, onions I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat? It's all vegetarian. I'll just have some bread. You used your hands. Oh, yuck, oh What, is it too spicy? No. These s'mores are disgusting. They're not s'mores, they're samosas. Do you think they have any s'mores? All they are is chocolate, graham cracker and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh? What? Rupa, Neepa, Tiffany, stop acting like such little losers and just be cool! Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone! I hate you guys. They said something about Zach Braff Don't even listen to them No, you know Very official. I decided to come. I feel a little underdressed, but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? Temp! Temp! I don't even want to hear it, okay? Stop it. Stop it right now. I didn't come to Diwali to get yelled at. Ryan is a temporary worker. Makes no money. Vali is a whole doctor, so handsome. Makes good money Do you think I want to date a doctor? and he's a perfect match. Hey, Big Tuna, you ready? Yep. One, two, three, shot! Oh, holy mother of God Oh, that burns! Golly That's good Wow! Thirty years. And you two only met once before the wedding night? Yes. Wow. How long have you been married to the cheerleader? She's not a cheerleader! She thought this was a costume party. No, we're not married yet. She is very fair. She is very fair. Very fair and very kind. So, tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die, she has to throw herself on a fire? No, okay. It's still very cool. Okay, thanks. One, two, three, shot! Are you okay? I'm gonna be. Hi. I'm just gonna Just for a sec. Just a sec. Everyone? I'm sorry. Could I have your attention, please? Thank you. Hi. Sorry, I just have an announcement to make. Okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight, but I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking, "Who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?" Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So, without further ado, Carole Carol Stills, I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. Oh, Michael What do you say? Can we talk about this in private? I didn't hear you? Can we talk about this in private? Oh, you gotta be kidding. Okay. No, I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is our ninth date, Michael. Well, yeah. But I I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but Carole, Carole, I just I feel like I just like you so much. I'd better go. Okay? You can find a way home, all right? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good night. Good night. Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you? 'Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra Okay, good night, Michael. All right. Good night. Well, I was a temp, but I got promoted. So the compensation is a lot more competitive. So you're saving money now Yes to start a family and home? Oh, or travel? And buy an Xbox. Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight? Can you believe that my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael. Is it? He's really outgoing, huh? Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second? It's hot in there. How's the naan? Dry. You look like you were having fun. I am. You should come dance with us. I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting? No one. I went to the doctor I went to the mountains I looked to the children Andy, no a cappella. I looked to the children I drank from the fountain There's more than one answer to these questions Pointing me in a crooked line Wait. The less I seek my source Oh, come on, guys, please. The closer I am to fine The closer I am to fine That's not good. Tuna! Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. Wow. That's so spicy. Here. Yeah. You're waiting for a call? No. Wow. Pam, when Carole said, "No," tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We're both the victims of broken engagements. Well, you were never really engaged. I was in that marriage arena, though. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well. I kind of thought something would happen tonight, too. So alike. So alike. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm rejecting your kiss. I What? I didn't Can I have a ride home? If you sit in the back. Night, guys. Hey, can I have a ride, man? I have my bike. No way, dude. I am not driving home. I brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it, though. It's a roomy twin. I'm good. Hey, dummy, get in the car. I'm a drunk driver. Yes, you are. Here, let me take that thing. Just get in the car. Okay. You can really hold your liquor, though, really. Yeah. You can't. Okay. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right? Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? So good. Good. These are not my shoes. This is just like that show Taxicab Confessions If you say one more word, I'm stopping the car.

Happy Diwali!
Hey. Hey. Who are you faxing so early in the morning? Kind of hard to explain. I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch. But before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery. So from time to time, I send Dwight faxes from himself from the future. "Dwight, at 8:00 a. m. Today someone poisons the coffee. "Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. "Cordially, Future Dwight. " No! You'll thank me later. There she is. Jan Levinson first thing in the morning. Michael. Love to start my day with a hearty bowl of Jan! Michael. Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby Michael. Yes. I'm here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch. I don't understand. The Board voted last night to close your branch. On whom's authority? The Board's. What? I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the Board asked me to thank you for your years of service. You're welcome. A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch and the rest will be getting severance packages. Am I a "small number" person or a "severance package" person? Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a "severance package" person. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No! What are they talking about? I don't know. Is it serious? I don't know, Kev. If you find out anything, call me. You got it, buddy. Are you all right, Michael? Do you want me to get you some No, no, no. A water or a tissue? All right. All right. You know what, I don't get it. I don't I don't get it, because our numbers aren't that bad, things are looking up. It's not all about numbers, Michael. Well It's about talent. Oh, you gotta Josh? Our CFO believes that Josh Josh. is going to play an important role in our company's future. Oh, really. What role is that? King of the stupid universe? Okay. Don't do this, Jan. I think we're finished and I need to go. We are not I would appreciate it if you would please use discretion until we get our ducks in a row. I know you're mad, but don't do this to me. I know I hurt you, but please do not do this to me. Don't hurt me like I hurt you. Jan. Jan. It is an outrage. That's all. It's They are making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. Do you think Stanleys grow on trees? Well, they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm. Pictures. Memories. Look at that. They grow up so fast. Hey, stranger. Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please. Sorry, I just feel like we haven't talked in a while. Well, we have nothing to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work. While you still can. When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is Something Weird is Going On: What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott with Dwight Schrute. Hey, did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton branch is Really? Wow, that's bad. Sorry. Scranton branch is closing? In your face. Well, I work here now. Sucker. Are you okay? Yeah, great, amazing. Best physical condition of my life. What did Jan want? Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so What can't you tell me? Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll all be gone in a few weeks anyway. What? What? You just said that we're gonna be gone? Do I have any messages? Michael, what's going on? I don't know. What did Jan say to you? Was she mean to you? Nothing. No, she Okay. Okay. Listen up, everybody, I have some news. All I can do right now is put on a brave face and go out there and be their leader. It's over. We are screwed. Dunder Mifflin Scranton is being shut down. Michael, we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made. You knew about this all along, didn't you? Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you. Traitor. You are a traitor. What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs? I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst! So this has been great! So let's get back to work and do the best job that we can. Toby, I'd like to see you in my office, please. All right. Oh, my God. You walk so slowly. It makes perfect sense that it would happen today. Because I just received this in the mail. A thousand business cards with this address and phone number. I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame. If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo + Juliet. The Claire Danes one. Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut! What happened? I think the word got out about Scranton. Hey, do you know any more details on that? Like, is Am I transferring here? You know, nothing's definite. In fact, you know what Excuse me, everyone. I know there are some rumors going around, but nothing is definite. All right? You guys have done a great job getting our numbers up around here. But until this thing is official, let's just keep working, huh? You know, be professional. Ladies and gentlemen, our fearless leader, Josh Porter! Josh, take a bow. Take a bow! I think it would be kind of weird if everyone from Scranton came here. It'd be like going to your high school reunion and you saying, "Hey, I missed you guys. " And then they're all like, "Oh, don't worry about it. "We're all going to move in with you "forever. " Yeah. Hey. Meredith, hello. Tough day? Yes. So, listen, I know you're seeing someone, but I'm still willing if you are. What willing? You remember. Like six years ago we said that on our last day of work that we would sleep together. God. I did not say that. Was that not you? No. Not me. Never mind. The day just gets worse and worse. It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. In my fantasy, I always thought I would slap someone, make a big speech and storm out forever. But this is good, too. You're kidding? No. What does that mean? Well, some of us are fired, and a few are going to Connecticut. Do you guys know who's going where? Don't worry. You're going to be fine, Roy. You're very strong and capable. Thanks. Oh, grow up. I don't want to work here without Pam. It'll just be like loading trucks without any meaning, you know. I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. I really couldn't be happier. Feeling nostalgic? Yeah, nostalgic. Hey, Mike. Darryl. Noble Darryl. Look, I heard about the office. Tough break. I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Yeah. Don't worry about me. I wasn't. So you'll be okay, too. You're a warrior, you're smart, capable. You'll find something else and Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew, so we're good. Awesome. This is my house. The CFO's taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance. All right. Listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. Like when you said the branch was closing? But I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan, and I am going to save our jobs, so just hang in there. Let's go. Yes! Oh, good, you're bringing Dwight. Yes. This might get ugly and we need backup. What's the plan? We go to New York, confront the CFO. Show him he's making a mistake, save the branch. Can I drive? No way. Shotgun! No, there's no one else. Still Thank you very much. Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office. Okay. Okay. But do not worry. I have his home address right here. Why? Christmas card list. You send him cards? You've never met him. But when I do, we'll have something to talk about. Hey, do you have a second? Sure, what's up? I know it's not definite or whatever, but do you know who's coming over here from Scranton? I honestly don't I don't know. Okay, so is it like Sales or accountants or You know what, Jim? I wouldn't worry about it. What does that mean? Hi! Jan, hey. Oh, good, you're both here. Ready to talk logistics? I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else, and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense. This kind of worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best. Okay! This is it! This is exactly what Michael Moore does. Famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like, "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? "You are bad, you're a bad person. " It's very dramatic. Although I can't say I was a big fan of Bowling for Columbine. Because I thought it was gonna be a bowling movie, like Kingpin. And it wasn't. It was something else. So Josh will be running what is now called Dunder Mifflin Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And, Jim, if you want the job, you'll be his number two. Wow! Sure, absolutely. Awesome. Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you there. I will not be taking the job. What Excuse me Why not? As of today, I have accepted a senior management position at Staples. Today? You leveraged your new position with us into another offer? Damn it, Josh, this whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I I'm sorry, all right. It's done. It's done. I gotta make some calls. Excuse me, I'm sorry, Jim. Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that. Okay. All visible points of access are covered. So, do you know what you're going to say when he shows up? I will improvise. I will speak from the heart. No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice. Okay. All right. Coming home from work. Excuse me! Mr. Wallace? David Wallace? Yes. What is the meaning of this? Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work? Well, the branch is no longer financially viable. It's simple dollars and cents. Yes, but these are employees, sir. These are human beings. Listen, Scott. It's no longer financially viable. We're losing money, okay? It's not a charity, it's a business. And it's a dying business. Look, the whole business model of the small, regional paper company simply doesn't make sense anymore. Stop. Stop it, just Okay, he's not gonna say any of that. Well, hey, why not? Because he'd be intimidated, and I just Let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay? Don't touch me this time. Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? Coming home from work. Pam, would you please sign my company directory. Are you serious? Sure. "Kelly. Best wishes. Love, Pam. " "P.S. "What a long, strange trip it's been. " So, we are still scrambling here, but it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford. Wow. And I know that you just left there a couple months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch. Thank you. Yeah. No, it's just I'm not sure if I Well, to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton and Michael. No! No, no, just some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revisit that, I don't think. Well, please think about it. And call me, we will do whatever we can to get you to stay. Okay. Hey, Meredith, how're you holding up? I'm fine. Hey, did we ever have a conversation about doing something on the last day of work? Does that ring a bell? No. I don't think so. Do you remember hearing a rumor about me and anybody, last day of work Something sexual? No. Okay. I'm kind of okay with it, actually. Oh, that's good. That's great. Do you know what you're going to do then? Well, you know, I've got art school. Oh, that's Yeah, of course. You should totally do that. That's a great idea. Yeah. I am. Already. I started a while ago. Wow, that's terrific. That's awesome. Well, cool. I'm glad you're doing that. You can learn a great deal about a man from his trash. Case in point. Satellite TV bill. Lesson learned? He's rich. Coffee grounds. Was he enjoying a delicious, hot beverage? Or disguising the scent of cocaine from drug-sniffing dogs? It's a nice house. Hey, guys, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since, you know, we're never gonna see each other again. Where are we going? I thought maybe Dee Jay's? How about Cugino's? I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore. How about Cooper's, then? No seafood. But I don't wanna go to Dee Jay's. Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky? Okay. Forget it. Hooters. No. $400 for the CPU. Done. Here, replenish your fluids. Where's Michael? He's not here. I don't know where he is. Wait What's going on here? We know the branch is closing. Michael told us. Oh, God. Okay. You know what, everybody? I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but I've driven something like 400 miles today, and I'm completely exhausted, so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing. Stamford is closing. For the time being, it seems that all of your jobs are safe. Yes. Yes! Stanley! Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something? Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please, wherever he is and tell him. Sure. Jan, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton? Back? Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton? You know, we don't know. Probably a few. Maybe we should take a break, get some food. Negative. We could miss him. I'm really hungry. Yeah, me, too. Who is it? The office. Are you gonna get it? No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news. Dunder Mifflin Action News. Jim Halpert, will Big Tuna be transferring to Scranton? I don't know. Jan offered me the job, but I haven't really decided yet. Yeah. Well, even if I don't get transferred, I'll probably be fine. Cornell has an extensive alumni network, so We look out for each other. I'll probably go back and teach or something. Where'd you go to college? Cornell. That's good. I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Which should be fun. New blood. Is Jim coming back? That's I hadn't thought about it. I don't know. I just don't want it to be weird, you know. I mean, I took his old job and his old desk. Yeah, you know, that might be weird. Overall, though, we still all have our jobs, so good news, right? Oh, yeah, totally. I am so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! It is the best day of my whole life! I don't know. I can't explain it. What are you gonna do? I really don't know. How you doing with all this? You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job. You'd actually move to Scranton? Yeah, if they let me, I think I would. New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton. I don't know, if I were you, I'd move to New York. Yeah, you know, I might do that. I might Who knows? I might do that. God! Hey, Andy! What's up, Josh? I just wanted to say thanks, good luck. Thanks, man, you, too, totally. Oh, well. What can you do? It was nice to have those few hours when I thought it was over. Now, I have something to look forward to. Hey, Creed. Congratulations. Thank you. I made like 1,200 bucks. Meredith Palmer. Hey, gorgeous. Who's this? Gary Trundell from the old days who worked in the warehouse. Oh, hey. Hey, gal, listen. I heard through the grapevine that your branch is closing. That got me to thinking about our deal. Remember? Oh, yes. Well, actually, the branch is Can you be at my place in 20 minutes? Yes, I can. Anything? Nothing. What if this doesn't work? What if the office actually goes under? Then it was an honor to have worked with you. All right. Favorite moments in Dunder Mifflin history. Go. My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with the fire extinguisher. That was hilarious. The foam. My first sale. My promotion to assistant regional manager. Our basketball game. And when you took me to the hospital and told me that you cared about me. All right, okay, that's enough, that's good. What were your favorite moments? All of them. I loved them all. Every single one of them. What about when Jan said the branch was closing? God, Dwight. Well, it Hey, Pam, we're going to Poor Richard's. Creed's buying shots. No thanks, guys. All right. Have fun, though. Cool. Hey, I hear Jim's coming back. Really? Where'd you hear that? Hey, Ryan, you coming? Well, I was Yeah, we'll meet you there. Awesome. Let's go, Phyll. I'll tell you later. Okay. Hey. Bye. Crazy day, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Man. I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here. Yeah, me, too. I mean, it'd be a pain to have to find another job, so Yeah, totally. All right, I'll see you. Okay. I was expecting a severance, some time off. But maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk. I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay. Hey, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton, it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it. Okay, yeah, maybe I will. Okay. Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but I'm kind of into him, so there you go. What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car. Oh, this was such a stupid idea. This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs! Nobody likes me anymore! Oh, my God! What? Stamford is closed! Michael, we're not closed! Stamford is closed! Stamford is closed! Is it? We did it! We did it! We did it! You did it! We did it! We did it! Yeah! We did it! Right here! Right here! Yeah, baby! In your face! We did it. Oh, man! How did we do it? I don't know. I have no idea. I don't understand. Well, for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But Costa Rica will still be there when I'm 65.
The Stamford branch is closing, and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats. That's the other thing you have to watch out Yo, Tuna. I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott. Yeah? So what's he like? Likes, dislikes, favorite sports, favorite movies, favorite men's magazines. You know what? I think you just need to meet him. Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. Sounds good, Andy. This is gonna be an adventure. Yes, this is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later? Bro. Hey, is that Josh's computer? What? Hey! Hey! How'd the run go? Pretty good. I finished. That's great. Yes. Why is that great? Because he accomplished something. What was your mile time? About seven. I could beat that on a skateboard. Well, that has wheels. Yeah, well, my feet don't, and I can still crush that time. Really, Dwight? How fast are you? Let's just put it this way. Last weekend, I outran a black pepper snake. Really? I am fast. To give you a reference point, I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther. Man, what is taking Toby so long? Oh, I'll just time him later. And you'll compare the times? Yeah. Are you ready? Set, go! No, my groin's really tight, I can't Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building, and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder sometimes, and on purpose. Like, he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. Hey, three more laps to go! You gotta pick it up if you're gonna beat Toby! I should probably get back to work. Here. Who's here? Nametag? Yes, please. Karen Filippelli. Karen Karen a-Filippelli! Probably Italian. Possibly Filipina. Okay My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. And that's all I'm gonna say about it, because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me, and I have to get into my head and focus. Who's next? That's Andy Bernard. Andy Bernard. If I were you St. Bernard. I would fire Anthony Gardner What? before noon I'm not to consolidate power. I'm not firing somebody on the first day. No, no, not somebody. Gardner! The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person. Good morning! Got the food, good! Looky, looky, looky. What I want you to do Set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice, as if you were trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league. Okay. Yes, I'm in a good mood today. I'm excited to meet all of the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy, to have an old friend back. Hello? Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr! Hannah Smoterich-Barr! Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball-and-chain is right over here.

Wait, are you a robot or a Martian? I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Hi. Welcome. Wow, you are very exotic-looking. Was your dad a GI, or I'll be the number-two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead, like a carpenter that makes stairs. Hello. You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome! And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and hello. Very good. Welcome to our little kingdom. We have a bag of nifty gifties for you. Well, Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom. Mike. Nifty! They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.

We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man! Wow, okay! How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. Not So your desk is Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here. Oh, my God, it's really you! I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met. I know, I don't care. Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good. It's really good to see you. You, too. Where do I stand with Pam? No idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. That is where we stand. Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. Hey, Dwight. Fact. I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me. Okay, sounds good. What are you doing? I don't know what you're talking about. Do I have a smudge on my forehead? No, you look good. Why are you looking at my forehead? I'm not. Meet my eye line, Jim! I am. Stop acting like an idiot! Okay. Hey, buddy. Welcome back. Hey. How are you, man? Good to see you. I'm good. How are you? So Oh, I'm sorry, are you sitting here now? Yeah.

Which, on a film set, is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film? I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them. Congratulations. Hey, Toby. Hey, Jim. How are you, man?

Good to be back. So Okay. All right. All right. Sorry about that. No problem. It was What? Nothing. "I present the orientation video. " We need to talk. Not now. Which is higher, Assistant Regional Manager, or Regional Director in Charge of Sales? I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale. Okay, so who gets paid more, me or Andy? It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different, okay? All right! Showtime, part one. Okay, who reports to who? I don't care, Dwight! You all report to me. That's all that matters!

You might want these orientation materials. Wrong, Toby, this is an orientation, not a bore-ientation. Okay, do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please. Oh, this looks promising. You won't be disappointed. Let's face it, moving to a new job can be very stressful, so I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it. And I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin, and what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together. And watch Sittin' in my office With a plate of grilled bacon Call my man Dwight Just to see what was shakin'! Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty So check out how we live In the Electric City! They call it Scranton! What? The Electric City! Scranton! What? The Electric City! Call Poison Control if you're bit by a spider! But check that it's covered By your healthcare provider! It reminds me of the orientation video Michael showed on my first day, The Scranton Witch Project. I am so scared when people don't label their personal food. You like coalmines and you wanna see 'em? Well, check it out, yo the Anthracite Museum Plenty of space in the parkin' lot! But the little cars go in the compact spot! Spot! Spot! Spot! Well, so far, I think it is killing. I thought it would either be an A or an A-plus, but I completely forgot that there is an A-plus-plus. What? This is Karen Filippelli, please leave a message. Terrible. Totally unconvincing. This is Karen Filippelli, please leave a message. Not bad. But you are Italian, so try it more Italian. This is Karen a-Filippelli, please leave-a me the message. You feel good? All right. Karen Filippelli. Hey, buddy. Anything new to report? Do you mean, to me from you? 'Cause that's how it works. Sure thing, buddy. Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there laying on the charm. Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screensaver. Do you like it? I do like it, actually. Thank you. You have such a pretty smile, by the way. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey. Hey. What happened to grape soda? Oh, yeah, I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase. You've changed so much. Well, I'm evolving, Pam. So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked, or You wanna grab a coffee or something after work? Tonight, actually? No, I'm just still getting settled, so Oh, yeah, no, you know, whenever. Okay. Okay. Sorry to interrupt, I Nope, you're not interrupting anything. Nope, I'm Don't. All right. Okay. All right. I should probably get back to work. Crack the whip. All right. Yeah, I know, me, too. The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic, but it's fine. It's great. A lot of distractions, but it's good. Take a picture, it'll last longer. I'm sorry, it's just It's a little distracting. Ditto that, my brother. Look what's on his computer! What is that, a squid's eye, or It's my left breast. How did you Right place at the right time. Oh, what's that smell? What smell? There must be an air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home. Oh, I'll help you find it. You know what, never mind. What is it? I think I'm just allergic to your perfume. My perfume? It's just my crazy nose. I'm used to different smells. Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine. Who's Bob Vance? You've a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word. People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the integration celebration. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one, united in applause. I know a lot of you must be thinking, "Wow, what a day. "It feels more like a night at a party than a day at work. " Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out, a night at the Roxbury. Okay, there's supposed to be music, and it's I got it, I got it, Dwight! Just Do you have batteries in there? Stupid What is love? That's it! Yes, yes! Okay. Here we go. Baby don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more Don't hurt me no more Let it rock, baby! What is love? Baby don't hurt me Here we go, here we go! Don't hurt me no more Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. You and me! You and me! Me and you! You and me! You and me! You! You! You! You! You and me! You! You! Oh, my nose is so itchy. Why is my nose so itchy? Probably because of all the nose candy. Okay. I told you these guys had a sense of humor. Very funny, Michael! Okay. Really funny, Michael! All right, all right, all right, I'm on a roll. Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them. Shouldn't we be equals? Not today, no. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table, if you would. This is difficult for me. Hey, I understand, we're all friends. No, I mean, I can't physically. I can't get on the table. Oh, well Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up. Okay? You know what? I'll help. I will help. No, please. Don't Don't be shy. Dwight, let's do this. Come on, we're doing this thing. Ready? On three. One Let's get up. Bend at the knees. Okay. Here we go! Here we go! I'm under this. I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here! All right, all right! Stop! Put me down! But it feels good. Push it, push it! I'm right in your crack! No, put me down right now! Don't give up! You got it, man! Put me down right now! I've had enough! Put me down right now! You got it, you got it! Wait, wait, wait, okay, okay, okay. Easy. Hey, easy. I'm sorry! Don't It's just not going to work for me. I have to go. I don't understand. I was on the fence about this, and it's just not a good fit. Well, we'll squeeze you in! I can't work here. I have to quit. You can't quit on the first day! That's heresy, my friend! Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what Was it Toby? Did he say something? 'Cause he's No, Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style. My management style? So Didn't you think Lazy Scranton was funny? No. Was it supposed to be funny? Okay, well Don't bother quitting, because you're fired. Excuse me? You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk! But there's nothing in my desk except coupons. Don't try to apologize to me, man. It's too late! Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you! That was my advice. Remember, I'm the one who suggested that you fire him! Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight. And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would none be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy. Fire Andy. Dwight may have won the battle, but I will win the next battle. Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional. Well, maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club. Whoa, Angela, hold on. Hooters is a restaurant with over 400 locations worldwide. Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together. No, we do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King? The word "merger" comes from the word "marriage" and that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it. Hey, hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires! What? Yeah, they punk'd us, they punk'd us good! Come on! Come on! Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? Does he ever. Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this! We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators! Yeah! Yeah? I don't think we can do that. Go home, Toby. Just Hey. Why doesn't your car have a flat tire? Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me! They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out, it's so hateful. "You guys suck! "You can never pull together as one and revenge us! "That is why you suck!" For crying out loud. No. No, no, no, no! No, you are falling for it! You are playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do! Don't, okay. What is with this guy? Got an hour? I'll try to explain. This is egregious! This is egregious! Trust me, it only gets worse. Is he always like this? Sometimes he brings more costumes. When do people work? We find little times during the day. How are we gonna get home? Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up. Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration. See that? Mission accomplished. They're like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although, that'll change! Because by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. Jell-O. Hi, Jan. Michael! Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit? I did. Major personnel crisis averted. Compliment accepted. Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? Yes. You do? But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my number two. What? No, no, no, Jim is your number two. What? He is the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this. Yes, I know that, for I do read the memos. So, after a great deal of thought and introspectivtion, I have decided to make Jim my new number two. If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise. No, it does, actually. So who will be your new number three? That I have not decided yet. Michael, I would just like to say that you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb. Thank you, Andy, that's very kind, thanks. And I have to say that your leadership has brought Shut it. Shut it. That's Suck-up. Hey, where you at, Filippelli? I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy. What's wrong, you didn't have a good first day? Oh, my God! Hey, you wanna meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink. Yeah, sure. Sounds good. I Hey, you know what? Can I give you a call right back? Yeah. Bye. Okay, thanks. Hey. Hey! I thought you had already left. No, I just had some other stuff I had to do. Good. What's up? Oh, nothing, I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today, or something. What do you mean? I just think I should tell you that I've sort of started seeing someone. And That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want. Okay, good. We're friends. We'll always be friends. Right. It's good to have you back. Yeah, good to be back. Saw your dork-mobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like, four miles to the gallon? Try double that. Classic Trans Am, vintage American muscle. Please. Yeah, my Xterra is pretty sweet. Luxurious yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese. Xterra's not even a real word. Actually, it is, it's Latin for "earth. " Oh, so you drive an X-earth? Yeah, that makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic Trans Am than an X-earth. Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back. Well, I hope 1985 has a time machine, 'cause I drive an '87. Speaking of time machines? I just got back from the future, and I went to your funeral, and guess what? Nobody came. Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die? That was a really well-constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-Not University. Idiot! If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a Trans Am. If you were driving a Trans Am, you'd be the smartest idiot in the whole world. Idiot! You're the idiot. Nice comeback. I was making fun of your comeback. That's why it worked. I totally got the best of that interchange.
Oh, she's absolutely adorable. He. Oh, sorry. He's He's dressed all in pink. That's his favorite color. Oh, that's fun for him. Fantastic. Oh, wow, look at that. How cute. Thank you. Oh, may I? Oh, sure. Hey, look at me! I'm a baby. I'm one of those babies from Look Who's Talking. What am I thinking? Look at all those staplers. What's a stapler? I don't even know. I'm a baby. Hey, Mom! I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk! And you know where milk comes from? Breasts. Hey. Hey. Almost done? Just about. Yeah. Now. Yes, I have started to see Karen. It's very new and Not really ready to talk about it openly yet just because I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or I don't know. Just not yet. Yeah, Jan, it looks like a check, a piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know. Jan, this is Angela Martin from Accounting. We have a rebate from the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. We get that money for hiring an ex-convict. I didn't hire an ex-convict, unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. I'm just kidding. When did the check come? Last week. Okay, that's when the branches merged. So Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move. One of the Stamford people is a criminal? Hey, Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby. Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal? A reformed convict, and I'm not sure so hang on, let me e-mail our H.R. Stay on the line. Who is it? Hannah? Andy? Andy? Martin? Oh, you are such a racist. Wait, why am I a racist? Because you think he's black. He is black, right, and He was the last one Stop it, stop it right Just stop it right now! Okay, it's someone named Martin Nash. Yeah! Michael? Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice, like a white guy who went to prison for polluting a black guy's lake. I wonder what he did. In our society a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and saw some people pushing each other and he intervened. Why would anyone go to jail for that? So what we need to do is to forget about this whole Martin-in-prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin andlor black people. Cool. Okay. Angela? Sure. Let's protect the convicts at the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally, I agree with that. Good. All right. Jim Halpert. I am so horny. Okay, I can't help you with that. Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty, good for a romp in the sack. She is dating Ryan, I think. Oh, and I care, why? She's high-maintenance. Next. How about Angela? Blondes are more fun. Come on, trust me on that. Yeah, trust me. That would be fun for no one. Okay, fine. Okay. Pam, the receptionist. Pam, should I go for it? Absolutely, you should. Jackpot. Just try to be cool. I am cool. Okay. Are you cool, really? I'm cool. I'm cool. I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on. Martin from Stamford was at one time in prison. No! Be cool, be cool! I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals. Oh, God! All righty, let's get started. What is she into? I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and just as important, I know the things that she hates. So one of the things that she likes is pranks and the things that she hates Frisbee-based competitions. Are you kidding? She I started the main Frisbee Golf Club at Cornell where I went to college. I live to frolf. Lead off with that. Okay She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags with the old guy. Got it. Also, do you speak pig Latin? Hey, Martin. How's it going? Good. Getting settled. Ah, good, good. Good. Just a second. Hey, everybody, may I have your attention, please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin, here, has had some trouble with the law. But I just want to declare publicly that I trust him completely and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb person, okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam, tell me a white person you trust. My dad. Danny Glover. Yeah. Jonas Salk. Who? Justin Timberlake? Oh, please. Colin Powell. Hey, I've got one. Yeah. Jesus. Apollo Creed. Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special. Baseball cap on backward, baggy pants. He says something ordinary like, "Yo, that's shizzle. " Okay, now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you. So, you all wanna know what I was in for? No, that's not cool. You don't have to tell them. I really don't mind. It was stupid mistake. I was working in finance and I got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. That is awesome. I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for because it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day. What was prison like? Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But at least we get outdoors time. You got outdoors time? Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pick-up football games Michael, why don't we get outdoors time? Yeah, some days I never go outside. Well, we are running a business. What was your cell like? Not good. It's a little bit bigger than Michael's office, but, you know, I really only slept there, you know? During the day our time's our own. They had classes. I took some watercolor classes. They have art classes? Yeah. Did they have business classes there? They did, taught by some Harvard Business School guys. A lot of the guys also that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business. Terrible things It kinda sounds like prison's better than Dunder Mifflin. Well, that's not true. I would so rather be in prison. Yeah. Prison sounds great. No, you would not. This place is not prison. This place It's way better than prison. Baby. Hello, baby. Here, you want to play with this? You can't give paper clips to a baby. He could swallow them. It's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no getting around it. So, I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos, maybe even toss a disc around. Ut-way ooh-day ooh-yay ink-thay, am-Pay? Wow. I Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back. Wow. That was Wow. Okay! Listen up, everybody! You guys said that prison was better than this place. And I heard you loud and clear. So, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go! Michael, it's freezing out. I can't feel my toes. Why don't we pump some iron? Anybody wanna pump up? What is that, like, five pounds? It's two-and-a-half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone. I'm going back inside. Yeah, it is freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about 27 minutes of rec time. Oh, hey, man. Hey. Did you have TV in the joint? Yeah, in the rec room. Like a 10-inch black and white? Actually, our TV was bigger than that one. These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American dream and they would rather be in the hole. Oh, Andy. I thought of one last tack you could take with Pam. Yeah? What? Quick question. Do you play the guitar? I play the banjo. Hold on, let me think about that. Yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy, high falsetto voice? You know I can, my man! Yep, that's perfect. Hey. Hey. Maybe I'll get my banjo out of my car. Perfect. What is going on? I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with just terrible information on how to get them to go out with him. I love it. I want in. Who's the target? Oh, you know what? It was gonna be Pam Perfect. But But what do I do? Just give me an assignment. Oh, you know what, though? I feel like I already sicced him on Pam. We'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else. All right, everybody, there has been a lot of name-calling against our office today, corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better than here. And none of us can say, "Boo," because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like. I'm Prison Mike! You know why they call me Prison Mike? Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else? Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, biatch? Whoa, whoa, whoa Hey, pass All right. Yay, yay, yay, yay. That's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I am here to scare you straight! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. You, my friend, would be the belle of the ball. Don't drop the soap. Don't drop the soap. Michael, please. Where did you learn all of this? Internet. So, not prison. And prison. It's 50-50. Both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home and recharge your batteries and come back in the morning and be with your friends, having fun in the office. What did you do, Prison Mike? I stole and I robbed and I kidnapped the President's son and held him for ransom. That is quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike. And I never got caught, neither. Well, you were in prison, but Prison Mike, what was the food like in prison? Gruel sandwiches. Gruel omelets. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair. Wow. Prison sounds horrible. Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Thanks. Prison Mike, what's the very, very worst thing about prison? Don't encourage him, Dwight. The worst thing about prison was the Dementors. They were flying all over the place and they were scary and then they'd come down and they'd suck the soul out of your body and it hurt! Dementors like in Harry Potter? No, not Harry Potter. There are no movies in prison. This is my point. You guys got it soft and cushy. This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome. Your boss is nice. Everybody seems to get along. People are tolerant. People who would jump to conclusions can redeem themselves. Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you, and from me, Prison Mike to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me and letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! You got a good life, a good life. So what do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it? Wow. Thank you. That must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you. Yeah, that wasn't really at all my experience. There's certain elements of what you performed I've seen on television, but it didn't remind me of my time in prison. Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great. All right. Well, here you go. Okay, Michael, come on, let us out. No! If you think prison is so wonderful, then enjoy prison. Are we gonna They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas. Hey, let us out of here. Hey! I have Shh. This is Toby. Hey, Pam. Where're you calling from? Michael, why is everyone locked in the conference room? They were very disrespectful to me and to the office and Martin has had a bad influence. To think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt. It's Well, you're gonna have to let them out, or I will, okay? You know what, Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so You know they're teasing you. I mean, obviously this is a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. And we have parties here. They're teasing you to be funny. Okay, nutcases, get out of there. Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home early. Time off for good behavior! Good job. Enjoy your freedoms. Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford to the convict, to my friend, back to a convict, then to kind of a nuisance, actually, if we could be completely honest, and finally, to a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. So we've been told and some choose to believe it But I know they're wrong wait and see 'Cause one day we'll find it The ainbow-ray anection-cay The lovers, the dreamers and me!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas No! Why did you bring that here? Don't worry, she's dead. Oh, wait. He's dead. Dwight? What I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle. Well, get it out of here. Relax, okay? And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? Merry Christmas, Dwight. Jim. Wow. What do we got here? What does it look like? Dead goose. And circle gets the square. All right. So, can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. Once I brought in a duck to prepare for lunch, and people got upset. Apparently they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed. He was already dead, and we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus, you can use the molten goose grease, and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. Wow. Win-win. Exactly. Thank you, Jim. I like goose. And it's already dead. Is it so crazy if we eat it? That's crazy. It's crazy. Dwight, you cannot keep that here. Okay, that is ridiculous, and totally against the spirit of Christmas. Come on, Dwight, we went over this, like, for half an hour. It's Christmas, Toby. It's a dead animal in our office. You can't Toby I'm sorry. Please. Please. Clean it in your car. I would like it off my desk. Oh, Pam, take a chill pill. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 'Tis Hey! I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam chops Can I help you, Michael? with mint. I'm looking for the Toy Drive box. It's behind you. Okay. Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it will fit, with all these little knick-knacks. Wow. What kind of bike is that? I don't know. Average kind. The tires look pretty worn. Well, that is probably from the test drive. But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael? No. Yo, Michael. Sweet ride, Mike. Oh, thanks. Yes? Michael? Oh, Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that. I didn't. It's from corporate. Okay. Did everybody get one of these? Yep. Terrific. Good. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend, Carole, is coming to our party tonight and I have a little surprise for her. I've got two tickets to paradise Pack your bags We're leaving day after tomorrow I'm taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means, right? Yeah! I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed. And a happy holiday to you. Carole. Hi. Is Michael around here? There she is! A Christmas Carole. Hello. You're about five hours early to the party. Oh, you're such a blonde. Michael Hey, everybody? I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend, Carole. This is just the front of her. Show them the other side. What? Turn around. Turn around. Come on. Get out of here! No, you get out of here. Michael? Yes. If I may say, she's even prettier than you described her. Oh, ouch! Michael, I don't think there's anything wrong with the way you described her. Thank you. I really need a moment alone with you. Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. What is this? That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. "Ski-eason's Greetings. " No. See, we never went on a ski trip. I know. I know. I went on a ski trip Right. two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband. Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you, in a sense. I was in your heart Michael  and next to your kids. What? This is so weird. I don't understand. It's a bold move to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. Is "bold" the right word? I think you're a really sweet guy. Okay. But I don't know how to deal with this thing, and the proposal, and I don't think things are gonna work out with us. No. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. You know what? You're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in "Jamaica's largest freshwater pool!" What are you talking about? I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica. We leave day after tomorrow. You had better find the skimpiest bikini there is. Michael And it's all-inclusive. Michael Yes. I'm sorry. No Carole? You walk out that door and it is over. I know. Jim? Hey. Hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now, because Well, I'll just tell you. What? For the past few months, I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. Are you serious? They're considering him for a top-secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never, ever tell. "Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off "because he said he had pneumonia, "but, really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. " Wow. So, here's the gift. You get to decide what his top-secret mission is. Sorry I didn't wrap it. You know what? I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, though. No, just because of the promotion. Oh, yeah. Just feels a little bit like No, I get it. Of course. Okay. I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do, then what am I doing? I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled. You can't cancel a holiday. Keep it up, Stanley, and you'll lose New Year's. What does that mean? Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley. Michael, what's going on? Carole and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. Will they still air Rudolph? That's not fair! Are we going to cancel Hanukkah as well? Fine! Have your party. Just no guests. But we invited guests. Well, you know what, Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid, rotten mess. So. Okay. It hurts. I know. It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms. Okay, well, why are you laying like that? Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts? Like what? Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed that were What foreign and scary? I I don't really And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine might have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to? I don't need to know. Michael? Yeah? Sorry to interrupt. It appears we're one bathrobe short. Take it from Toby. Copy. Pam, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? It's all Okay. No, thank you. Hey, Dwight. Pretty nice robes. I Why? Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch. I thought you said green was whorish. No. Orange is whorish. So, I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle Okay. It would never work here. Okay. Another idea was karaoke. No. A Christmas drinking game. Yes! God help you. What? These are all terrible ideas. And none of them are on the theme of a Nutcracker Christmas. I think you should leave. You're kidding. You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. Please? Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. You touched my heart you touched my soul You changed my life and all my goals I know you well I know your smell What are you doing? We're getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carole. Hey, what's the haps? Carole? Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carole's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. You have been the one for me Why don't you just buy the whole song? I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just want I just want a little taste of it. Look at this, she saved you $2,000 because they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final How did she Oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. That Carole is one smart cookie. Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend You have been the one You have been the one for me You touched my heart, you touched my soul This is an old adage. But they say that when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carole, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her. I feel like I've been kind of cold to Karen. And there's no real reason for it. I mean, it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her. Hey, Karen, sorry about that meeting today. That was really crazy. Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because I don't know how those meetings usually go. Usually like that. Does anyone ever stand up to Angela? Or I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. Right. I really liked your karaoke idea. Oh, cool, yeah. That could really be fun. You guys do a raffle? Thank you. Yeah, we do a raffle. Hey, Kev. Hey. This should have been up yesterday. It'll be all right. What is that? "The Committee to Plan Parties invites you "to a Margarita - Karaoke-Christmas"? There's no such thing as the Committee to Plan Parties! There is now. We just started it. Well, you can't just start a committee. You have to have funding. What's your funding? Two hundred dollars. What's ours again? Two hundred and one dollars. Right. Hey, a margarita-karaoke- Christmas party. That sounds like fun. No. That is not a party. There is only one party, and it's hosted by the Party Planning Committee, and it starts at 3:00. Then why are there two flyers? I understand that this is confusing for everyone. Let me explain. There's a party that starts at 3:00 Right. and then there's a way more fun party that starts at 2:45. Right, and if you're interested in the way-more-fun party, all the info can be found here, on our more brightly colored flyer. I didn't see where it was. Yep, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right? I think that's really Pam and Karen, I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning immediately. You can't do that. As ranking number three in this office, I am order I'm number three. You're number four. Yeah, but I'm number three. No. You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately. They will be returned to you on January 4. Okay, I think I can help here. Okay, good. As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees, and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. Okay, this is stupid. Could you please keep it down? I'm in session. I have determined that this committee is valid. What? No! Yeah! No! Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Permission to join the Validity Committee. Permission denied. Damn it. Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. Come on! My treat. All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway. That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too. Hooters? No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. I need my entourage. Jim! Dwight! Ryan. Come on. We're going to Asian Hooters. Oh, man, I can't. Why not? I'm not feeling so well. I got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy. I just ate there last night. All right. Feel better. Thanks. Come on, Jim, let's go. Okay. Wow! Thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. Doctor appointment. Car trouble. Planter warts. Granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho, and you told her that she was the only ho for you, and that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then Then suddenly she's not your ho no mo'! So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today. " Thank you. Michael? Head of the table. May I? Actually, sir, I'm going to need to take this chair, so Dwight, just leave him. Leave them alone, please. They are on a date. They look very happy. So she looks at me, right, and she goes, "I'm sorry. Do I even know you?" After a year! A year of buying lattes from her. Do you believe that? Yes. I can't hear what you're saying. Carole used to drink lattes. Who're you talking about? She would get this little foam mustache Carole had a mustache? and I used to say, "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, "That's not funny. " What are you guys talking about? She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh Michael? to enjoy each other. Michael. What? Repeat what you said louder! It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't Okay, I'm gonna call her. I am going to call and find out No! Who are you calling? Put it away. Put that away. I'm going to call her. SOS! We Hi. Mayday! Man down over here. We need your help. What can I get for you? I think we'll start with a round of Nagasakis. One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you, though, because eggnog is seasonal. You should put out salt for the rims. That's a great idea. Phyllis? I was just getting a snack. You can have your snack in here. Pam, don't tell her what to do. Phyllis? Okay. I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to. So, I only use three? If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong. Okay. And where'd you get all those cool bows? Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. Okay. Are you sure I can't use, like, the cartoons from the newspaper? Oh, yeah, your mom will love that. Hey. Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. Bye. He's cute. You should date him. Yeah, maybe. Looks like you got a little Nakiri knife action going there. No, is Usuba. Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though. Actually, the Usuba is the better knife when you working with this quantity. I don't know. Still think Nakiri's better. I think he'd know. Nothing he's doing is cheering me up. Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey, Cindy, he just had his heart broken. You wouldn't do that to him, would you? I don't know. Sure you would! Look at you. I bet you break up with a guy every hour. You made her laugh! Yes! She totally digs us. Watch. Watch. Watch. What did I tell you? You're right. That's good. Hello, everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So I have a very important announcement to make about your paychecks. Your paychecks will be arriving, as scheduled, on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they normally are in.

In fact, it will be starting right now. Our party is also starting now. Yeah. All right, Stanley! Good choice! Welcome, Hannah! You will not be disappointed! Why would I be disappointed? I said you wouldn't be disappointed. Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry. That a threat? No, it's an invitation. We have vodka! Lots of it. I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. So double-fudge, Angela. Double-fudge, Angela. Brownies. Cupcakes. Don't push it. Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. What? I got goosebumps. I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years over some disagreement I don't even remember. So Yeah, I'm pretty good. Mmm. Damn, this chicken is good! My compliments to the chef, which is you! Right? Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. That guy's got steak. I see steak! Excuse me. Excuse me. En garde! It's family style. No. It's not.

Okay Cindy, you are so What What's happening? She's asleep. Narcolepsy. Probably. Okay. Now, open your eyes and describe it to me. I don't know. It has four bedrooms and a loft. Oh, my God! Now she's up. Yeah. And she's trying to describe how to correctly butcher a goose. But she's having trouble coming up with it. Okay. Cindy! Yo! Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back, insert the knife beneath the jaw, bring it all the way around. There's gonna be a good amount of blood. But don't let that bother you. Have a bucket there for the blood, and the innards, and the feathers. Oh, no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a Okay. It's pretty much the same thing. What do you think? Fruity, and delicious. See, I told you. You want one, Meredith? No, thanks. They're too sweet. Hey, so, what's the status? It looks like they forgot the power cord. What? Oh, you're kidding me! No. Oh, God. You guys Guys? I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. What? Well, that blows! Hang on, little ladies. You don't need this thing.

Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs? Yeah, but we don't have a power cord. I may have seen it somewhere. Is it this one? Yeah, thanks. We'll go tell everyone. Okay. Okay.

Well, I guess I didn't really score, and I'm not sure who is actually shooting, but Whatever! Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or, as my ex might say, "Domo arigato, Mr. Scotto!" Little baby Pa rum pum pum pum I am a poor boy, too Pa rum pum pum pum I have no gift to bring Pa rum pum pum pum That's fit to give a king Pa rum pum pum pum Yeah.

Oh, you know what? Sorry, I forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier, and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down in their headquarters at Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. We should get him a bus ticket to make his trip easier. Oh, no, that would be great. We should try. It costs $75. Well, maybe the CIA could send a helicopter. "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone. " "Destroy phone. "
All right, let's get started. Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing card stock this week. So, let's push card stock this week. Also What is this? Tape recorder. For what? For recording. Michael is on vacation and he has asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts. Okay. Karen, any news from that law firm? Yeah, the deal closed yesterday. It's a six-month commitment. Oh, my God! Dwight, what are you doing? What? You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. I'm not. Dwight, you know what, just back off, okay? That's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh, my God, he's got a knife! I do not have a knife. No. Let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck? Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet. I am not. Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in. Dwight, get his autograph for Michael Jim Carrey did not just walk in, okay? Yes, he Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? Oh, my God, Karen, you're right. That is Animal from the Muppet Babies. You can't see my stomach I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chain saw! Hey, mon! Hey. You have a bunch of messages and That's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memoed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother, and so you might also have to be deposed. Relax. Just relax, okay? Okay. I'll get to all of it later. It's kind of serious. Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me. How was Jamaica? It was so good! Hey, mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says, "Hey, mon," everybody says, "Hey, mon," back. Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here. Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too. My bonus check was $100 less than you promised. Okay, well, payroll is in charge of all of that They said I should talk to you. Well, I am just getting settled in. So I'm gonna I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check. You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers, mon. You wanna talk about it? Nope. I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a for-rent sign down the street from Jim, and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together in different houses, two blocks away. Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing. It's good. You know, I had never been out of the country before now. I got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great. You know, they just relax, they party all the time. It's kind of an impoverished country. Yeah. Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having piña coladas every day at 3:00. Well, you can't today. We're doing inventory. Inventory's at the end of December. We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed. I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it. Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans? Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin Warehouse Inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. By the end of the day? That's impossible. The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible". Yep, it's English. It's "impossible". Michael, there's no way we can do it in time. How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need. Come on in! Settle in. Settling Settling And settled. Good. There is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? "No shirt. No shoes. No problem. " This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what if we have to stay late and do inventory? No problem. Oh, my God. Is that Jan? What? Where? What? On the left. No, no, no. That's Oh, my God No, that's a German woman named Urgle Grue. Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it could get us both in trouble. So, officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there in our room at night and in the morning. And that's all I'm gonna say. Sex. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan. Hey, dude. I just got back from Jamaica. Big whoop. I was in Hotlanta. That whole town is waxed. Yeah, that sounds amazing, but you know what? The lady, Jan Levinson, wanted to go to Montego Bay. You took The Ice Queen? I don't buy it. Well, I'm looking at a photo, right now, and, I'm telling you, it could be in Maxim. They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim. Oh, no? No. Okay. Well, check this out. I'm sending you some e-mail. You got it? What? No, I got nothing. Check it again. Hit refresh. Yeah, Mike, still nothing. Okay, wait a second. I sent it to you at packer@dundermifflin. com Packaging@dundermifflin. com Uh-oh. Wait. I just got it from somebody else. Wow! This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture? Darryl? Hey. Hi, where's Darryl? He's in the office. Okay. Hi. Hey, man, how's it going? All right. What's up, Mike? That's great. Okay. So did you get an e-mail from me? Yeah. Okay. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not Packaging. Did you already forward it to a whole bunch of people? Uh-uh. Okay. Well, did you get the second e-mail that I sent explaining that the first e-mail was a mistake and that you should delete it? Yep. Have you sent that out to everyone? Mike, I'm very busy down here. Yikes. Already sent it to you, my friend. Fantastic. Boring. Call me if she rolls over. Hey. Hey. You okay? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Yes. I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. Oh! You want to talk about it? Really? I have a special assignment for you. Who's the target? A sensitive e-mail has been released into the office. It contains a file. A picture. The filename is Jamaica Jan Sun Princess. What's it of? Not important. Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. Okay, then forget it. Okay, I accept it. So, I don't know, I just feel like we've been dating a month, right? Same street, I think that might be a little close. A little bit much. What? How far away does she live now, like, 10 minutes? Yeah, I guess. Honestly, I think you should go easy on her. No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah. Hey, thanks a lot. Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell, which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan Yeah. How have we not talked about this already? I mean, what happened there? Kidnapping? Hey, I need to talk to you Not now, not ever. about you and Jan. None of your business. I wish that were true, but it It It seems from that photo that two of you have entered into an intimate relationship. That photo is my personal property, and if you are telling me that you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. Michael, nine different people e - mailed me that photo, including my ex-wife and we don't talk. Well, this is probably the icebreaker you need. You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR. I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you, you skeevy little perv? All right. If you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it. No, no. No, I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on Earth. Got enough, weirdo? All right, thanks, Michael. Okay. Okay, we only have three hours, people, to plan a whole luau and you're not helping. What are the ingredients of poi? I've called every grocery store in Scranton and no one sells whole pigs. Did you try the petting zoo? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael? It's Jan on the phone. Oh, God! No, no, no. Hang up. Hang up. Tell her I'm not here. Don't Don't I've ran out of gas. I hit a deer. I hit I hit a deer with my car. No. I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat. He'll call you back. Okay. Great. Do you think she bought it? Okay. Okay. Michael hit a deer? Michael! Michael, there's an emergency in the warehouse. An accident? Is somebody hurt? No, it's It involves the photograph. Oh, God! No, no, no. Mike, you're a rock star, man! You are the man! Yeah! Well done! All right. Okay. Hit that corporate booty. Nice to hit it! Hello! Hi! Attention, everyone. Apparently, there is an e-mail circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rated picture of me and a woman. Jan. No, Kevin, a woman. Maybe Jan, maybe Urgle Grue. My point is that if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it, sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right? Feelin' Feelin' hot, hot, hot Hey! Hey. What are you doing out here? Island living, you know. Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you. Did she say what it's about? That's all she said.

I have ordered that be taken down. All right. I've destroyed all printouts from the bathroom. There are copies in the bathroom? There were a lot of them. All right. I think I owe you one. Sorry? For talking sense into Halpert. The Days Inn Room 228 was staring to get really depressing. Yeah, I know, don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous. Yeah. But thanks, seriously. Sure. Okay. Yes! Yes, what'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up. You see that? This is the greatest night of my life. Who did this to you? Where is he? What? No. It's not It's nothing. It's hot in here. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. You don't need to stay here. I know. So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh? Hello, everyone. Hello, Michael. Hello. Hi, Jan. You look tan. I was in Scottsdale, visiting my sister. Yeah? How was it? Very sunny. Family's important. Michael. I would like to speak with you in your office, please. Okay. Yep. Why am I here, Michael? I In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not communicate. This is neither here nor there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies, and that for once, I should indulge them. Are you following me? Yes. I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even Even if it means lowering my expectations or redefining the word itself. Okay, yeah This is the thing, you know? I am attracted to you. I don't I don't know why, I But I am, and I need to follow my instincts. At least, that's what Dr. Perry thinks. Who's Dr. Perry? I This is the point, okay? You're wrong for me. In In every way. But I still Well, I find myself wanting to be with you. And I to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are, as well. Good. Good. So, thanks for coming by. Yes I Oh. Good. Okay. Okay. Thank you for taking the time. Well, thanks for coming over. I appreciate Wait 15 minutes, okay? Then find an excuse and meet me at your condo, okay? Okay. Jan? You complete me. Oh, God. Hey. You remember when we were planning our honeymoon, and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico? Yeah. I was definitely right. Oh, brother. What am I gonna do? I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art.
Angela. What? That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them? They arrived this morning. Are you sure? It is a big deal if Is it a big deal? Is it, Kevin? Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal. Five of us transferred from Stamford. There's two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we're touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I'm not falling in a chocolate river. Everything okay? It's fine. You are in the clear. Thank you. I don't want those. Dwight, care to join us? Finally. Thank you. Hey, Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it, Michael? Yes. Okay. Here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first. Well, let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott? PhD. Doctor of sales. Well, I appreciate that. That's very gracious of you. Well, it is very gracious of you to accept. Well, thank you, sir. Okay, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior. We're the same age. And I'll pick Karen. Oh, thanks. Good. Next up, the Super Fly himself, Stanley. Pass. You can't pass. You gotta pick somebody. I'll take the kid. I'm very flattered. I was his second choice after pass. So that just leaves Dwight and Jim. Okay, wait. Does anyone want to trade? Yeah, I'll trade. Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh, young Jim. There's just so much I need to warn you about and yet, tragically, I cannot. Sebring by Chrysler. A heck of a motor carriage. Dwight! Yeah? Here you go. Yeah! You want shirts on hangers? Please. He does your laundry? Long story. All right, everybody, circle up! Here we go. You know what this is? This is The Amazing Race. And you guys are retired Marines, and you guys are the mother-daughter, and you guys are the gay couple, and we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go? Wait. Amazing Race, like, the biggest sale wins? No. We're just gonna rush out, do the sales thing and come back. Is there a prize? Just bragging rights. Then how is this Amazing Race? It's just It's Amazing Race, Phyllis, okay? We're in teams of two and we're on a mission. All right. So, on your mark. Get set. Go. Let's do it. Come on! Michael Do you have a pole? Let's go get a broom. Seriously, are you gonna sit in the back? Yeah. It's the safest part of a car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side first. Here we go. In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally. In this case, Michael. And here's the good news. Every success I've ever had in my job or with the lady folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down. What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry? That is a long story. A couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job. And I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. Wow. That is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially the part about Dwight going behind your back and basically being, like, a terrible person. You know, if you want your laundry done right, I used to work at Abercrombie, so Pretty good folder. Hey, Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee? Really? Yeah. I thought you could use some fresh air and it might be fun. Okay. Sure. Okay. Why are we turning in here? This is a beauty salon. Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after? You want the lead? Yeah, if you don't mind. Mind? Nothing would delight me more. Leave the keys. You still do that thing? Leave the keys. I think that you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like everyone has their own special skill, you know. Just like the Super Friends. Except for Dwight, who's kind of more of a Super Dud. I mean, he'd be a Super Friend if there was a Super Friend whose super power was always being late. You know? Hawkman. My plan is taking longer than I thought, but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons, so Let's go. The men's room was disgusting. After you, sir. No, thank you. I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of 10 attacks are from the rear. Okay. Well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I'll attack you from the front. Yeah, but it'll be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. Or I can counter it Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. This friend of mine Let's call her "Noel. " She missed this deadline turning something into corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman, we'll call him "Kurt. " He drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's I don't know. I guess he just really likes her a lot. Well, that's great. Yes, it is. Hello? Hey. Did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack? Yeah. You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad and I never caught anything that big. I caught an 80-pound shark off Montauk. That's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-foot Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's- nest. Also shot a deer once. You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hard work and decency. Okay, this is the classic undersell. Because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York. I have to say I'm a little wary of getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past. And I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company. Man, that is like poetry. I swear. No. This guy could sell paper to a tree stump. I'm so sorry, man. I really screwed that up. I really No. Don't worry about it. I really Schruted it. What? I Schruted it. It's just this thing people say around your office all the time. Like when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you Schruted it. I don't know where it comes from, though. You think it comes from Dwight Schrute? I don't know. Who knows how words are formed. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. This is Pam. I did? Yeah, I did a watercolor of Francis Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won. My painting won! So I'd like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I'd like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth-grade class that picked me. It's a big order. Thanks, Ken. Yeah, thank you. Hey, how's Annie? She's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda? Stanley Hudson. Julius, how's it going? Great, great, great. Stanley, so good to see you. You, too. I'd like you fellows to meet Ryan Howard. Hi. Yeah. I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword puzzle. Ryan. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello, Ryan. Hi. What do you have for us? We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra premium laser. Okay. Okay. Can I use your phone? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Thanks. Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know that tax season's coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked. We have discount prices on ink cartridges. One. Three. And also any forms that you're gonna need Seven.  we can custom make them. Hey, Kev, guess what? I won an art contest today. How much did you win? $100. I won 400 bucks on the Celtics game last night. Cool. Congratulations. Thanks. It was so sweet. And you just said, "Hi! Hi! Hi!" You sounded like my niece. And she's six months old! Well, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but it makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys. Sure. That's true. We can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service? Very. Please keep holding. Your call is very important to us. That's one of the big guys. Been on hold this whole time. And this is Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin customer service. This is Kelly. Hey, Kelly, it's Jim. Oh, my God! Jim! How are you? I wanted to tell you Here's my card. It's got my cell number, my pager number, my home number and my other pager number. I never take vacations. I never get sick. And I don't celebrate any major holidays. All right. I get it. We got a deal. All right. Hey, Angela, I got good news today, too. I won an art contest. That's great, Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens. I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager is You understand. Well then, have a nice day. Thanks. That was fun. Yeah. I really enjoy spending time with you. You're a very nice person. Thank you. I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung-up on Pam for such a long time. I didn't think he'd ever get over her. That's nice. You can pay me back later for the makeover. Hey, boss. Got a minute? Yes, Andy. I forget. Why did Dwight say he was late this morning? He didn't say. That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a toll booth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So Why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? You think he went to see Jan? That's not like him, is it? Someone told me a story about this With like laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something? No. You are remembering it wrong. Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? "Fool me once, strike one. "But fool me twice, "strike three. " Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote, "Beeswax Not Yours Incorporated. " I knew it. Oh, doggie. Hey, you wanna grab a coffee? Sure. Look at you. Yeah. Beesly, coffee? No, thanks, I had some already. All right. But, hey, Jim. Yeah? I won an art contest today. No way! Yeah. All right, Pam. Congratulations. Thanks. Which one was it? I sent them one of my watercolors. Cool. It was a new one I did. Are you ready, Jim? Yeah. Can I see it when I get back? Yeah. Congratulations. Thanks. Big deal. Hey! We nailed the sale. Where were you this morning? I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow. Why do you lie, liar? I'm not a liar. You are lying right now. Sure seems like he's lying. Stay out of this, you! I know that you went to corporate this morning. And I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you to tell me right now exactly what you were doing this morning. Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me. I would never do anything to hurt you or this company. Okay, you know what? I want you to think about your future at this company. I want you to think about it long and hard. That's what she said. Don't Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day. It's gonna be okay. How's it gonna be okay, Dwight? Everyone will know our business. Well, that's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. Well, I don't have a lot of choices. So, let me ask you a question. Okay. Did you ever have a thing for Pam? Pam? Did I ever have a thing for her? No. Why? Did she say something? I moved here from Connecticut. Yeah. Okay, here's the I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So it didn't amount to anything and I left. I'm really glad you're here. Okay? Okay. May I have your attention, please? This will only take a moment of your time. "Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, "I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. "I do not fear the unknown. "I will meet my new challenges head on and I will succeed. "And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. "It's been a pleasure working with some of you "and I will not forget those of you soon. "But remember, while today it is me, "we all shall fall. " In other words, I'm quitting, so Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-dawesome Dwight is now gone, which is totally awesome Why was he gone? He was such a nice guy No, he was not He was a total douche Doompa-dee-doom I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take it. Except this. Good luck. And this one. Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but he will be missed. Dwight from sales was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had. One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered. Hey, man. What happened on your sales call? Am I happy about the way things turned out? Oh, "Happy's" such an ugly word, but I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty Hello? Pretty good. I have left Dunder Mifflin after many record-breaking years, and I'm officially on the job market and it's very exciting. For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts. Professional resume, athletic and special skills resume and Dwight Schrute trivia. I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me. How would I describe myself? Three words. Hardworking, alpha male, jackhammer. Merciless, insatiable. There's nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon. I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And it's fine for the time being. Break's over. Big Turkey? He rocks in the treetop all a day long Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song All the little birds on Is that you singing? All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. Wow. Took me forever. Nice job. Thank you muchly. Oh rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight Every little swallow You gonna answer it? Every little bird in the tall oak tree I called it myself. Just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring. Yikes. Side note, just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you. Cool. I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future, Andy and the Tuna. Andy and the Tuna Oh, what a duo, magical Andy and the Tuna I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe, you win. Yes, Dwight Schrute has left the company. More personnel turnover. Cost of doing business. Yeah, well, it is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman. Was the top salesman. I said "was. " Right, addition by subtraction. What does that even mean? That is impossible. Yeah, you're right. But there is some good news. Oscar is back, addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back, and hopefully, that'll lift everyone's spirits. Hi, everyone. Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gaycation? That's very funny. Yeah? I thought of that like two seconds after you left. Hi, Angela. Oscar. Hey, boss. Hey, what's up? Nothing. Man. TGI Wednesday. Am I right? Yep. Gonna go home, get my beer on, get my Lost on. What're you doing later? You wanna hang out? Oh, I don't know, maybe. Well, I'll take that as a maybe. Where're you going? Bathroom. Oh, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you. Things are going pretty good. Getting a lot of face time with the boss. Oscar, I have a question. Would you like to join the Party Planning Committee? The committee with all the women? Yeah. Because I'm gay? No, no. Certain events have transpired and I've thought about certain things, and I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. And I would just like to make some changes about certain things. And certain situations and certain accounts. Okay, okay. All right, all right, I'll join. I'd love to. That's Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can I join, too? Never. You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work. Child's play. Give me something hard to sell. Wow, what is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible. Do you want me to ask the night cleaning crew if they stopped watering it? Yeah. Oh, you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk, too. They always used to arrange the toys on my desk in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning. Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight. Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around this office. Feel you, dawg. Yeah, do you? Absolutely. What did I say? You said Which is like Right on. Pam was like, "Blah, blah, blah," and you're like, "Yeah. " Nailed it. Wow. Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot? Too much. Like a crazy person a little. Not super crazy, just There's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my biznezz, which is Ebonics for being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me. I don't understand how someone can have so little self-awareness. I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party. No, hey. Hey, don't be ridiculous. Of course we're going to have a party. The celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I wanted to be Oscar specific. Michael No. No, I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexicanness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So, Phyllis, I want you to go find firecrackers and a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga. Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office, Michael? Would that be good? A burro. Of course, if Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one. Need any help? Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking. Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all. Think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Got my rod here. Click, click, click, click. Click, click, click, click. Click, click, click, click. Hey. Hey. Hey, so Andy is in rare form today. Yeah, you should not encourage him. Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We gotta do something. Look, I've got like 15 new clients that I've inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature, so I'm sorry. I can't. Fine. Party pooper. Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Mar-something? Andy is like Mar-something. Great sportscaster, big weirdo creep. Hey, guys. How's the workload? All of Dwight's old accounts. Handling it okay? Sort of. He had a lot of clients. Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? Oh, sure, we talk all the time. Really? No. Don't do that. It's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close. No, sorry. Dwight had a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together, it can be explosive. Really coming down out there. The commute's gonna be hell. I have snow tires and chains, plus exceptional hand-eye coordination. So, where were you working before this? Dunder Mifflin. What kind of company is that? Paper company. We're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area. I never heard of them. Oh, really? Have you heard of paper? It's gonna be like that, huh? I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady, little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter. In your head in your head Zombie, Zombie Zombie In your head Would you like to pull a prank on Andy? I'm kind of in the middle Yes, please. Okay, good. Stay right here. Zombie In your head Sorry about that. Oh, smooth move, Tuna. Nice one. Are there any messages? No. So weird. Nice to have Oscar back. Yeah. He rocks in the treetop all a day long Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song Large Tuna, have you seen my cell phone device? No. 'Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call. well you really gonna rock tonight Every little swallow Angela. Is everything okay? No. He rocks in the treetop What's going on? What're you talking about? Where is my freaking phone? Love to hear the robin goin' You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling. You know what? Maybe you're in the ceiling. Okay. I don't trust you, Phyllis. Every little swallow, every chickadee I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he had to drive to New York to drop off the quarterly tax forms that I forgot to send. Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company. Do you think that anyone else out there would've driven to corporate for you? None of them. Especially not Andy. Oh rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly. Where are you going? Want me to come with? Listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bar, beers, buzzed. Wings, shots, drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football, Cornell, Hofstra. Slaughter. Then, quick nap at my place and we hit the tizzown. No. I don't wanna do any of that. Duh. Which is why I was joking about doing it. No, just stop. Stop. Just stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy. Fine, I'll just go sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. Excuse me. He rocks in the treetop all a day long And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little news flash. It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freaking un-funny! Every little swallow, every chickadee God! The wise old owl and the big black crow Flapping them wings That was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good? Yeah. Sure? Okay. Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper, it's your funeral. See how that works out for you. Hey. Hey. What's up? Same old. It takes a big man to admit his mistake, and I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. Oh, my God, she told you? Yes, she did. And, Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly, I misjudged you from the beginning. And I apologize. Accepted. How's this place treating you? My boss isn't funny. I don't get to wear my ties. No. Sure. So So maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. I don't wanna do your laundry anymore. We can talk about that. All right. Oh, my God. That's half-inch dry wall. I think we broke his brain. "It's not freaking funny!" You really enjoying your fiesta? Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would but turns out it's great. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Mr. Dwight Schrute. Welcome back. Thank you. Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. Not bad, huh? You did this for me? Guilty. Hey. Do you still have feelings for her? Yes. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale. Sir, would you do the honor? Oh, man. No, no, no, no. I don't need it. It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is, I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still, management material. This whole thing's supposed to take I expect to be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo. Oh, hi, you must be Andy. Oh, hi. Yes, I am, and you must be Marcy. That's right, it's so good to meet you. It's so good to meet you. Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun? Yeah.

DWIGHT: Well, that question is meaningless.  Just go with the copy paper, it's your funeral.  See how that works out for you.  Hey.  Hey. What's up?  Same old.  It takes a big man to admit his mistake, and I am that big man.  Angela from accounting told me what you did.  Oh, my God, she told you? Yes, she did.  And, Dwight,  if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker,  then clearly, I misjudged you from the beginning.  And I apologize.  Accepted.  How's this place treating you?  My boss isn't funny.  I don't get to wear my ties. No.  Sure. So  So maybe you should come back.  You should come back. Please.  I don't wanna do your laundry anymore.  We can talk about that.  All right.  (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)  Oh, my God. That's half-inch dry wall.  I think we broke his brain.  JIM: "It's not freaking funny!"  You really enjoying your fiesta? Actually, yeah.  I didn't think I would but turns out it's great.  Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Mr. Dwight Schrute.  Welcome back. Thank you.  Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?  You did this for me?  Guilty.  Hey.  Do you still have feelings for her?  Yes.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale.  Sir, would you do the honor?  Oh, man.  No, no, no, no. I don't need it.  (YELLING)  MICHAEL: It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did.  The important thing is, I learned something.  I don't want somebody sucking up to me  because they think I'm going to help their career.  I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me.  So Michael had a little chat with corporate  and they decided to send me to management training.  Anger management, technically, but still, management material.  This whole thing's supposed to take 10 weeks.  I expect to be done in five.  How? Name repetition, personality mirroring and positive reinforcement  through nods and smiles.  So don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back.  Just like Rambo.  Oh, hi, you must be Andy.  Oh, hi. Yes, I am, and you must be Marcy.  That's right, it's so good to meet you. It's so good to meet you.  Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun? Yeah.
Hello, Son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a How do you know it's gonna be a boy? How Would you stop interrupting, please? Yesterday, I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die, I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life. Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to. To jump-start a car, first, pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then, you take these and clip them wherever. Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra. What We will demonstrate on Pam. No. And No. Come on. You just twist your hand until something breaks. Ow! Well, you get the picture. Thanks, Pam. And remember, no matter what, I will always love you. What if he's a murderer? He's not gonna be a murderer. Maybe that's how you die? You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this or no? I wanna do this. Okay. From the top. Ready? Three Action. Hello, everyone. As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. So get your suits to the dry cleaners and get your hair did. And Karen, you might wanna invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It's my job to insure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta. Prima nocta, I believe, from the movie Braveheart and confirmed on Wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So I'm sorry, I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant. I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes, which won't be hard, because it's gonna be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat. What's up, spinsters? Nothing. You know, this is a luncheon shower. Girls only. No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse from 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guys' night out. A G.N.O. If you will. A gno. Actually, it's more of a guys' afternoon in. A G.A.I. A gay. Not Not It's not gay. It's just a It's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour-long shower with guys. I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks, but we had some really good talks and, actually now, I think that we're better than ever. Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and every night for the last five nights. Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business. But I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck. Halpert! Tall, queer, handsome as ever. "Hey, everybody, it's me, Jim. " Hello, hello. Todd Packer. Karen Filippelli, Jim's girlfriend. Shut up! Yep. Shut it! That's rude. Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight. Yes! Yes! There What happened? What? Oh, God Quick! Somebody help! Help the man! No! No! No! I can't believe you're not gonna be there. It's gonna be good. It's gonna be a great bachelor party, man. I have a full day of sales calls. You should get out of them. Oh, God. It's the only time he can do it. It's gonna be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're gonna be grilling up some steaks. Got some pie, going to be very delicious. And what kind of stripper did you get? I did not order a stripper. What do you mean you didn't order a stripper? No You ever even been to a bachelor party? Not personally, no. Mike, okay. A stripper is Bachelor Party 101. I I If you don't get a stripper, your party's gonna suck. I can't get a stripper here. Sexual harassment. Get one for the girls, too. That evens it out. Like, you know, separate but equal. So that's what that means. Okay, everybody, a slight change of plans. We are still going to be having two parties, but each is going to get a little extra dose of naughty. All right! Okay. What? Okay, co-ed naked strippers in this office, for realsies. Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office. Shut up, Angela! Hey. Hey! Everything okay? Oh, yeah. Why? Well, you seem a little tired. Yeah, well, I guess there's been a couple of late nights. Karen and I have been up talking. You should get more sleep. Yeah, I know I should. Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. No, I'm sure you're right. When I get eight hours compared to like, six hours, it's like, big difference. Really? Oh, yeah. You've got to get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping better than not. Good advice, Beesly. Thanks. See you out there? Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk! Oh, my God. Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers. Absolutely not. I'm on it. Well, get on it and make it happen. Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles. No tats. No, tats. Of course, I want Stop. That's disgusting. Leave me alone and get the male stripper. Fine. I knew you would, Nancy. Sally.

Sparkling cider is very good. I think that's champagne. Hello, ladies. Who, here, is a history buff? I. Who's a fan of buff naked?

Yes, but Ben Franklin was. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the Founding Fathers And when they came over on the Mayflower. Wait. This is the entertainment? Yeah, all right, so, I want you to give him your undivided attention. And Mr. Franklin. If any of these ladies misbehave, I give you permission to spank them, especially that one. Have you ever seen a stripper before? Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases. Yeah, me neither. Hey. Hi. I'm Elizabeth. I'm the dancer that was requested. Okay. I specifically ordered a stripper. I'm the stripper. Oh, okay. Good. Well, in the future, please identify yourself as such. Oh, God. Okay. "Is she hot?" Text back, "Kind of.

Like, a lot of them? Well, that is a gray area of my life. Okay? So it was a warm June evening Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors. Is it the same grill you grilled your foot on? No. Yes, but I got all the foot off of it. Oh, gross. Okay, Ben Franklin. Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem in his mouth!

So I guess, you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, "How can I put this to practical use?" Well, I'd like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator, and he really pressured him into it. Hey, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys. What do you mean? Well, that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine. It's not a big deal, it's just a kiss. But you're not still interested in him? Oh, yeah. Really? Oh, no! I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim.

You know, I invented electricity. I know. Well, I'm sensing a little electricity right here. Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis? Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon. On one hand, I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth. On the other hand, I'm afraid she's gonna dump me. You know, Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son. Really? But I kept all this from my wife, Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler sex. Wow. Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleazebag. Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me? "Secrets, secrets are no fun. "Secrets, secrets hurt someone. " Wow. Thank you.

I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand. When When did When, last night? No, today at work. You went to a bachelor party at work? Yes, I kind of arranged it. Well, I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Did you guys think she was hot? Kelly, don't do this. Do what? I just asked you a question. You know what you're doing. Anyway, you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam. Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there, Beesly? Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know, Ryan, I'm I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever. Okay. Oh, my God, I would get so fat if I worked here. Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time.

I'll talk to you later. You are. You are. So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And, Elizabeth, the stripper, gave me great advice which rhymed. It really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become President, but someone like Elizabeth can't. Are you near-sighted or far-sighted? Both. That's why I invented the bifocals.
Oh, damn. I lost another file. Gonna have to reboot, again. Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid? What do you think? In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. So, for the past couple weeks, I've been conducting a similar experiment. Dwight, want an Altoid? Okay. Altoid? Sure. Mint, Dwight? "Mint, Dwight?" Yes. What are you doing? I What? I don't know. I My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. Always the bridesmaids, right, ladies? Okay, for this next one, everybody hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in and the sisters and you and you and you. Great. Phyllis is getting married and I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding, which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis, but it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the Bride. Yes. I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before. Phyllis ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So, it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like, "Wait, I thought I called that off?" So, what's in the box? A toaster. You? A toaster. Unbelievable. Hello, Angela. Hi, Dwight. You look as beautiful as the Queen of England. Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left. The Schrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. It makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair. Those flowers are nice. Yeah. "P and R"? Phyllis and Robert? Oh, of course. Also, Pam and Roy. There she is. I swear, Phyllis, you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin. Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside. How you doing? Are you excited? Yes, very. Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is okay. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight? No. Because I know you're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay if you did, it's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding, and you're nervous That wasn't me. Okay. I'm sure that Bob Wow, that is That is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Are you set on that hairstyle? I thought it was Michael, no Here, let me. I don't need your help. Thank you, no. Just cover up that bald patch. Michael, please. I just need some time alone. Okay. Okay. You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My mom was marrying Jeff, and they asked me to be ring bearer. And I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet. I hate you! A long story short, Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that, after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said boo. Why are all these people here? There's too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people? You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. No way. Did you ever see that movie? Of course I saw it. I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theater. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theater, but I kept waiting. Because that's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it. You know, I just wish I wish I had the investigative powers to actually smoke some of these guys out, you know? Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift. Hi, I'm Kevin. Where did you find her? At the gym. Right. The gym Could you scoot over? You're on my dress. I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding. I know, but there was an emergency. I look really good in white. This strapping, young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Elbert, and he is quite the ladies' man. Aren't you, Elbert? Huh? Ring bearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this. Are you ready for this, Elbert? I am. Let's do it! That's my dress. It's This is Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now, the wedding has no highlight. I can't believe I pushed that guy's lazy ass around all day until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's Well, I've got news for you, Elbert, if that's your real name, the show's not over. And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you, for the first time as a couple, Mr. And Mrs. Bob Vance! And do you, Bob, take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do. You may now kiss the bride. Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time as a couple, Mr. And Mrs. Bob Vance! That's what I'm talking about! Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Thank you. Your dress is very white. It's so white, my eyes are burning. Thanks, Angela. Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know, if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you. If you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you. Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too? Best of luck, Phyllis. Also, I'm gonna need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers. I don't have that, Dwight. Damn it, Phyllis! Are you all right? This must be so awful for you. What do you mean? Well, this is supposed to be your wedding. Oh! No, that's actually fine. There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just, like, freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant. Okay. That's a lot of good ideas. Thanks. Excuse me, sir, how do you know the happy couple? Who? The bride and groom. What are their names? I don't I'm not sure I get it. I get it. Come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on. Okay, okay. Where are we going? You've got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend. Phyllis? Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter? It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat and enjoy the buffet. I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back. It's fish. I will take care of that. I do. I know a fair amount about fine food and drink. This is a white. No, this is not our first wedding. This is the third wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding. Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I'm supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It's a very serious situation. Roxanne You don't have to put on your red light Those days are over Hey. Hey. I know I don't normally notice these kind of things, but this wedding's really nice. I mean, the flowers and stuff. Phyllis has got some great taste. You're kidding me, right? I know you probably aren't gonna remember this, but, those color roses, I got you those color roses for our prom. Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding. I guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning. Yeah. Sorry about that. It's okay. Well, you think it sucks for you? I'm the one who actually wanted to get married. Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler! Cheers. Cheers! Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott.

Hey, Kevin. Nice of you to join us. Where were you? My tire blew out on the way here, Michael. I almost died. I went into this skid Pop quiz. What? Why is today a special day? I almost died. Today is a special day because I am being honored as a visiting professor. Special lecturer? Emeritus, how did you put it? You will be a guest speaker in my Emerging Enterprises class. In business school, Kevin. Business school. Wow. If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full-letter grade. So, I'd be stupid not to do it, right? A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students, and then, like, 12 other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. Really ruined eighth grade for us. Here we go. College road show. Gotta bring our A game. What is the most inspiring thing I ever said to you? "Don't be an idiot. " Changed my life. Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing. Will they throw their hats, you think? What? A lot of times, at a school or naval academy, after a rousing speech the crowd will throw its hats high into the air. You understand, nobody's graduating. Yeah, I know. I know. I'm just saying, if they did throw their hats, I've got a great line for that. May your hats fly as high your dreams! That was a pretty good line. I'm just It doesn't apply. I understand! Wow! Relax, spazzy boy! Sometimes you're such a little spaz! God, I'm driving! Hey! Quit it. We have fun! I can't wait for your art show tonight. Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Thanks. I'm really happy to be back with Roy.

Solving a mystery, if that's quite all right with you! Come to papa! Okay, ladies and gentlemen. What we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately, I have found it before Bat! Get it out! Bat! Bat! Oh, my God! Bat! What do you mean No, I won't remain calm! There it goes! Goodbye. God, this is Angela Martin. Please don't let that stupid thing come anywhere near me. Please make it go away! Okay. This is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now. Dunder Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling or unable to adapt. Their customers are dying off I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it. We have a bat in the office. Simple solution would be to open a window, if we had windows that could open. Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop. Okay, thanks. Animal Control will be here at 6:00. At 6:00? No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim. You are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership! I'm sorry, what'd you say? So weird. What? What's so weird? The bat I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look, there's no mark. I feel so tingly, so strangely powerful. Oh, well. And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott. Hello, everyone, I am Michael Scott Hello, I'm Brandon Fidalgo, CEO of The Teaching Company. These And I'd like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh, economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then you will have a book that is worth its weight in gold. I know, those are expensive, but the lesson is priceless. Good. All right, I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business, tourism, food service, railroads and sales. And hospitalslmanufacturing. And air travel. This is your job, Halpert. Ow! What happened? That bread on your desk. I just picked it up. It's white hot. But, Jim, this garlic bread is cold. What? No, it burned me, I Bizarre. No. No. One crisis at a time. If a vampire bat was in the U.S. It would make sense for it to come to a "Sylvania," like Pennsylvania. Now, that doesn't mean that Jim is gonna become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ. So, you want to start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply, you need something to sell. Now, this could be anything. It could be a thingamajig or a who's- he-what's- he or a Whatchamacallit. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay. And if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 GRAND. Satisfied? This looks great. I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. Damn it! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it. So Oh, no, you should go. Well, it's important to support local art. You know? And what they do is not art. Okay, I'm seeing some confused faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit, break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies Michael  and products! What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing. Well, okay I'm just kind of getting going Yeah, I know. All right, okay. Well, we can do questions. Okay, very good. First hand up. Sir, as a company that primarily distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world? We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny e-mails, but real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. Hey, Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted. Oh, thank God. I've such a headache from that glare. What glare? The glare off Angela's crucifix. It's blinding. I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once, but by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog. Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. Will you form an allegiance Sure. to use sudden violence? Okay. Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake? What size? What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain? I say, "You will miss our service "and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back. " Has anyone ever come back? We don't want them back. They're stupid. How far has your Herfindahl Index declined since the merger? Nice try. How's your Polack-says-what Index? What? Thanks, Kowalski. Can we get back on track here? By your own employee's calculation, you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years. Wait. Ryan said that? What are you doing? You better not hurt that little bat. Animals can't feel pain. Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family! Flush him towards the door. On my go! Now! Bat! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! I am a hero. Yeah, sure. You know business. Sitting up here in your ivory tower and your ebony tower. Well, you know what? I tell you one thing, Dunder Mifflin is here to stay! But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain? David will always beat Goliath! But there's five Goliaths. There's Staples, OfficeMax Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda. Global warming. Sex predators. Mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school? But in the big picture, you have Dunder Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't, you're too young. Ryan has never made a sale. And he started a fire, trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well, you know what? He doesn't know anything and neither do you. So, suck on that! It wasn't personal. Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things. Pack my You heard me. Pack your things. I really want to come out! Good night, Mary Beth! So, you're cool to just wait here for Animal Control? Animal Control? I've been controlling animals since I was six. Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades. There's just so much sun in here. Bye, Dwight. Goodbye, Jim. And good luck. Jim is on a path now, an eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen. And it's all from the same series. Called Impressions. Not that I would call myself an impressionist per se. But maybe one day. I hope so. I still need, you know, my breakthrough or whatever. Hey, babe. Hey! How are you? Good. I brought my brother. Hey, Kenny. Hey, Pam. Hey. How about this, huh? I show up with my brother and no one from work is here. That's pretty cool, huh? Magic time. My hair! Get off! Get off me! Get it off me! Get off me! Hold still, woman! Get it off! I got it! I got it! Get it off! You're welcome. It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them. Yeah. I'll just I'll drive myself home. To my place? Maybe. I'm a little tired. Your art was the prettiest art of all the art. Thank you. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation. And, of course I was wrong to suggest that Dunder Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me. Fire you? No, no, no. You are moving to the annex. To the annex? Where Kelly is? A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business. You're the one who said we needed more culture. This is culture to you? It's her first try. Yeah. On Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants. Meaning what? Meaning real art takes courage, okay, and honesty. Well, those aren't Pam's strong points. Yeah, exactly. That's why this is motel art. Thanks for coming. Pamcasso! Sorry I'm late. I had to race across town. Oh, Michael. Wow! You did these? Freehand? Yep. My God, these could be tracings. Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. How much? What do you mean? I don't see a price. You want to buy it? Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my window. And there's my car! Is that your car? That is our building. And we sell paper. I am really proud of you. Thank you. What? Do you have something in your pocket? A Chunky. Do you want half? No, thank you. Okay. It is a message. It is an inspiration. It is a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless you had a camera. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited. I won't. I won't. I won't. I won't. I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't! I won't!
Can you confirm that the straps are tight? Yes. But this seems a little And now the chains. A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self-fulfilling prophecy. It's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic, and a little extra time after school. Magic, magic, magic. And now, Michael the Magic will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. Can he do it? I don't see how he can. I know how. He'll dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out. No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. Three Sorry. Sorry, quick thing. So is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you? I will get out. Oh, yes. I will. So we shouldn't help you no matter how much you might beg and plead? No. All right. Just This is getting hot, so let's just do this, okay? Ready! Three! Two! One! Go! Is everything okay, Michael? Yes. I cannot tell you how I plan to escape other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key All right, ready? Come on, guys. Early worm gets the worm. Another worm, like, are they friends? That's, "Early bird gets the worm. " Okay. Pam, would you smell my breath? No. No. Let me smell. Good. Not great. Michael, you go to parties all the time. Why is tonight so special? Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple for the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party, really. And that is why tonight is so special. Jimbo, last chance, carpool. Oh, no thanks. I think Karen and I will take my car. You sure? Might be a good idea Yeah. if we all went together, we could save some gas, have fun. Long trip. Thanks. Play some games? Not Yeah. I Spy. Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason. So, let me think here. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time. Or in my work time. And did I use the word "pointless"? Thanks for inviting me along. Oh, sure. I really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? Hello, you. Michael? Hey, buttercup. Hi. I am on my way. I should be there in about 15 All right, let's just blow this party off. That's what she said. Yeah. Am I on speakerphone? Yes, you are. Is anybody else Hello, Jan! Hi, Dwight. Okay, Michael, take me off speakerphone. No problem. Okay, let's just go to a motel and Okay. just, like, rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica. Okay, Jan? Jan, this party is actually a very big step for us. So I I'm still on speaker? I I I don't know. Are the cameras there? Maybe. Okay. See you soon. Okay. All right. Bye. Talk to you later, Jan. Hey, Michael left early. So a bunch of us are gonna go to Poor Richards for happy hour. You should come. I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet skis and he, kind of, took a bath, so we're gonna go get hammered. Okay. Well, we're going to a bar. Hey, you have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious. If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. Okay. I've decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm gonna start telling people what I want directly. So look out world 'cause old Pammy is getting what she wants. And don't call me Pammy. Beauty. Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. Thank you. You're dressed exactly like the servants. Shut up. Okay, change shirts with me. Wait. I don't think yours will fit me. I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket on Don't give me that. That would have been really embarrassing. Yes. Crisis averted. Okay That duck is so cute. Hey, Pam. Hey, guys. Oscar. Angela. Hi! Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo, de facto, go to a party early, become a really good friend. Oh, potato salad? It's from both of us. No, it's not. Wonderful. Let's see where we can put this. Okay. Oh, you know, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here. It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just You never know. Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet? Yeah. Oh, my God. When is it? It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this. Hey! Hey! You made it. Well, you said it was important, so It is. How's it going? What's up, Pam? Hey, Kenny. Sorry about the jet skis. You guys all want a round on me? Yeah! Yeah? Let's get you a drink. Thanks, man. I'm thirsty. No, thank you. Roy, I You should get a round, Pam. Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces. What you looking for? You bring dip? I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waiver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy and a third copy goes to HR. Awesome. I'm gonna frame mine. I could frame yours, too. You realize this is This is a legal document that says you can't sue the company Over our love. I've never told you that I love you. You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all. I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self-loathing. Downside? I date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star. What's this over the "I"? It's a heart. Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh, my God, what am I saying? I love this woman! Oh, God. Michael, please. Michael, please. Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica? No. No? Then you're an idiot. Hello, Michael. Rachel! Boy, you clean up good. The place looks great with all the lights on and everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So Jan, glad you could make it. Oh, of course. Of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott from the Scranton branch? Of course I do. How are you, Michael? Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. David, can I speak to you privately for just a moment, please? Excuse me. Okay. No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a light. Oh, sorry. So did the merger go smoothly or It did. "Like butter. " Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen. She was one of them. I'm the only one left. Everybody else was either fired or quit. And there's one in anger management. Yeah. But you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great? We're good. Michael, please stop that, okay? Can I get anyone anything? I could go for an appe-teaser. Martini, please. Yep, Bagel Bites or something. Rachel, your house is beautiful. Thank you. What's the square footage? About 5,000. Does that include the garage? Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate. I don't know. It's a common question. David, how much did this house cost? These old Colonials are great when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around. I'll show you around, sure. Cool. Let's start with the banisters. Hey. Do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall? Yep. That's Drake. And just so, you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we used to date. Okay. Cool. Thanks for telling me. And it didn't end well. Got you. All right. This was a gift from Lee lacocca. Twenty-year-old single malt Scotch. Here is to Mr. Lacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. Are you okay? Yeah. Do you have any ice? Sure. How about some Splenda? One, two, three! Up Jenkins! Down Jenkins!

You can't keep anything from me. Bottoms up! Hey, Creed. Hey! What's up, Creed? What do you guys up to? Hello. You're the man, buddy. I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine that I swiped from the sheriff's station. Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? That's a guest room. Just the one window? Oh, I must get that. You'll have to excuse me. Are those real pearls? Yes. They're Good. Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care. Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kind of saw him for a little bit when they were separated. Oh, didn't notice. Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable. No, it was before I knew you, so it's fine. This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out. That's nice. You and the missus should join us in Sandals, Jamaica next Christmas. Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family. Yeah. They don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non grata there. Oh, but it's fun. It is an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. It's crazy. David, I'm sorry, you're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it? Sorry. What's What's the matter? What What did I Come on. Just Just Just What are you doing? Don't you know what I'm doing? Yeah, but you could tell me. Wow. What What is that? Why are we Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this was where you liked your privacy. Shut up. What has gotten into you? No, no, no. What? Come on, let's get back to the party. Come on. Wait, let me just take my dress off. We're missing everybody. Don't take that No, stop it! Stop it! Jan! No! No! No! Michael No means "Please don't. " Means Slam me up against the wall right here. I'm not going to slam you up against anything. You're acting inappropriate, Jan. I want you so I'm acting inappropriate? Yeah. Forget it. Get out of my way. Here. Hey! Where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. I was Hey, don't you have a daughter? Yes. Oh, good. You're up. Hey, who makes this chair? I don't know. It was here when I was born. I want one. It's really good, solid construction. It's comfortable. What is this, oak? I don't know. What do you know? God, I hate these parties. You wanna sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes. Now you stay here and have fun 'cause I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace. Okay. Don't mention that you and I are dating 'cause I think he might still have feelings for me. Wallace? What the hell? Have you dated, like, every guy here? Wow. Okay. You got me. I so got you. So none of them? Of course not. I mean you're, kind of, like, my first. Really? Oh, my God, it's so easy Okay. it's not even fun. Hey, Jan. Not too good. Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad? Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad. But I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There's something wrong with Jan. What's What's with Jan and Michael? I don't know Where to begin. My ball. The chimney's in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation. So, all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party. What? I want us to make it. I want a fresh start. That's awesome. That's what I want. Okay, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us. I didn't I didn't do anything. Ask anybody. I totally could have and I didn't at all. Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim. What? He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings, too. And we kissed. Jim came on to you? Just listen. No, I am listening! That's the problem, I'm listening! Don't yell. Don't yell? This is over. Yeah. You're right. This is so over! Are you kidding me, Pam? Come on! God! Stupid jet skis! Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle I feel sick. You didn't have any of the potato salad, did you? You know, we were good when we were just running around, you know? In secret. It was wrong and it was exciting, and maybe it was a mistake to take it public. Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. Michael Greatly. Please don't cry. I'm not going to cry. I feel like it, but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million pieces? It was never a love contract, Michael. Yeah. And besides, I have already given a copy to David. It would be just as embarrassing to get it back from him as it was handing it to him I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling and the giggling. I didn't mean it, okay? I was Whatever. I was tired. I'm tired and I didn't eat enough. And that's all. That was it. That's it. You didn't mean it. That's all. No, I didn't. So That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it. Okay. Fine. I love you, Jan. Okay. Don't break up, you guys. You're great together. Are they gonna call the cops? No. I paid them off. Jet ski money? All of it. I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
So, do you want to see it or not? I don't know. They're, like, Friday night crowds Oh, my God. You're, like, agoraphobic. Agoraphobic? Yeah. Really. Yeah. You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. Absolutely correct. Later, Jim. Kev, have a good weekend. Yeah, sure. Bye. Okay, so this is what's gonna happen. You're going to suck it up. Here we go. And we're gonna go to dinner. Okay. And then we're gonna go to the movies. Sounds good. Hey, Halpert. Hey. Roy! Roy! God! Pam, please call security. Every day for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And every day, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? No need for consternation. Everything is under control. Michael, last Friday, one of your employees attacked another employee in your office. It was a crime of passion, Jan. Not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled. Is Toby there? No. I'm here, Jan. What is the situation, Toby? Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company. Thank God. Yeah. But now, apparently, Darryl has some issue with this No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months, and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage. Well, are you gonna take care of this? Yeppers. What did I tell you about "yeppers"? I don't remember. I told you not to say it. Do you remember that? Yesh. I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude. But I just, I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked. I guess all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray, and not the nunchakus or the throwing stars. Hey, man, I never got a chance to thank you for stopping Roy. Thank you. "Thank you" not necessary and thus not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. Okay. Got you something. Don't want it. You don't know what it is. Don't want it, won't open it, don't need it, won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. It was a little glass display case for his bobblehead. That would have made his evening, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even-Steven. No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the Commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes. Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up. Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. It was crazy. Man. You saw it? Describe it, please. Well I heard some shouting, and I look over and Roy's by reception, and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something, Roy stops over there, all of a sudden, bam, Roy goes down and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. Oh. It was insane. Well, good for Dwight. Okay, I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise because I need to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. Where'd you get that? Wikipedia. Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information. Okay, Darryl, ask me for a raise. Hey, Mike, since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work and I need a raise. Well, that's interesting, Darryl. I think that maybe you should Can't hear you. What I'm saying is that Still nothing. Okay. See what I did? No. By leaning back and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. Nice. Okay, let's try another one. Okay. Walking out of the room unexpectedly. And what happens in this one? That's a surprise. Okay. Go ahead, ask me for a raise. Can I have a raise? Sex. Steve Martin. Teri Hatcher. What? What? Well, what did you say? I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what would happen. No, it's It sounded interesting, what you were gonna I saw the perpetrator advance towards the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked, indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place. Which is where? Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose and face area, rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end. Thanks, Dwight. That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. I can't imagine what I would have done. I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like the time we were on the Ferris wheel, and that kid dropped a milkshake on me and you just laughed. Well, that was funny. That's why. Oh, it was? Okay, well, the next time that you get scared that you think a murderer is in your apartment in the middle of the night, and you call me to calm you down Okay, you know what, I Could you stop?  you can just call somebody else because I'm not going to do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not. Well, don't talk to me about calling There's a bunch of people back here. I call you in the middle of the night Guys. to tell you that I love you. I don't think Michael intended to punish me by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But if he did intend that Wow. Genius. Yeah? You ready for me? Yes, yeah. Absolutely. Have a seat. You know what, actually, let's go into the conference room. Okay. No, you know what, let's stay here. Let's go. Yeah, let's go to the conference room. Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws them off. Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control. I am declining to speak first. Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple, really. I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now. Darryl, you are a good worker and a good man. I just You know, times are tight, and I just don't think corporate's going to go for this right now. Are you wearing lady clothes? What? Are you wearing lady clothes? Those look like lady pants. No. This is a power suit. That there is a woman's suit. I do not buy women's clothes. Do not make that mistake again. I'm going to call Roy, man. Okay. All right. This is going to make him feel better. This is too good. All right. You know what, Pam, would you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit? Oh, my God. That's a woman's suit. You're wearing a woman's suit? No. I do I wear men's suits. Okay? I got this out of a bin. There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was riffling through them like crazy. And I grabbed one. And it fit. So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least, it's bisexual. Who makes it? It is mysterious, because the buttons are on the wrong side. That's the mystery. Look, it's got shoulder pads. And did you see that lining? Okay. Did you see that? Would you stop it, please? So none of that tipped you off? It's European, okay? It's a European cut. Michael, the pants don't have any pockets. No, they don't, see? Italians don't wear pockets. It's been a really rough couple of days. This helps a little. Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet? No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton. Let's just do this in 15. Okay, can you stand right there for one second? I got to send some e-mails. Negotiations are all about controlling things, about being in the driver's seat. And you make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore women's clothes. So, Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman? I feel great, Kevin. Thank you. You must have been scared out of your mind. Well, you know, it happened so fast, I didn't really have time to be scared. What happened, exactly? I wasn't here. So I haven't really heard the whole story. Well, Jim and I were talking. And Roy walked in, looking super angry. And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way and Roy cocked his fist. And then? And then, bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. Goodness. When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more. Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. Well, it's simple, Mike. I mean, we merged these two branches, right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. And with Roy gone, we've got a smaller crew. And I'm picking up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly by getting a raise. Well, those are very good points. What? I can't hear you. Those are very good points. I can't What, Mike? Are you You make a very compelling argument. Sorry I almost got you killed. Yeah. That was nuts. He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what I was thinking, right? No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection. Not anymore. It's completely over now. We'll see. I'm sure you guys will find your way back to one another someday. Jim. I am really sorry. Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it. I'm going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want. Then I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. Why can't I just tell you? Because that is the way these things are done in films. Now slide it. Yes. There you go. Oh, come on. Be serious. I am serious, Mike. That's a 10-percent raise. That's what I want. I can't give you that. I don't make this much. Come on, be for real, Mike. I don't. I'll prove it to you. There is a pay stub. Are you serious? You're earning this? Plus perks. Yes. Mike, this is barely more than I make. You've been here ten years, dawg. Fourteen years. No, please, please don't. I'm sorry, Mike. Some mofos got to hear about this one. Okay. Let's take 15 again. A boss' salary isn't just about money. It is about perks. It For example, every year I get a $100 gas card. Can't put a price tag on that. Okay. If you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something. When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer? Boy, I No. And why are you so interested in buying me something, Jim? What's your angle? It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now I want to be nice to him and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating. Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. No. Yes. That's probably what it is. So what do I do? I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. Michael? Here's the $15 I owe you. Thank you. Yeah. I heard you might need it, so Here's the $40 you gave me. I didn't give you $40. In a way, you did. Yeah. I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid. Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. Okay, all right, I got to go. Late. Okay. Okay. Here's the straight dope. No tricks, no Wikipedia. What? I talked to corporate and they told me that I can only give you a five-percent raise. That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not going to give the working man more than the boss. Well, what am I supposed to do? Get your own raise. You've got to get out there and earn, son. I'm not going to go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous. Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay? And we're shipping more now than we ever have. That's true. Yeah, that's true. You got to call your girl and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship. You know what, I should. Yeah, you should. I've been a loyal employee for a long time. Fourteen years long. You know what, I deserve a bump. Make it happen, Captain. I am making it happen, Sergeant. I remember it was very late at night, like 11:00, 11:30. Big fella comes in screaming about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car, something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter You're useless. Well, why don't we talk next month after the quarter ends? No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I want to do it today. Today? All right, well, if you want to do it today, we should do it in person, and can you get here by 5:00? Yeah. Yeah, I'll leave right away. Great. And listen, because of our, you know, situation, we're going to need to have a third party present. Yes. I'm bringing Darryl. Darryl from the warehouse? Mmm-hmm. No, Michael, we We need an HR rep, so I think you should just bring Toby. Hey, I'd rather kill myself. Michael, he's your branch's HR rep No, Toby is terrible. and we need someone else in the room Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. because of our relationship. Michael! Either Toby comes with you or we don't do it. Fine. You are so mean. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid. No. I said Toby, come on, let's go. Where? Where? I'm going to smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go. What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? All right. Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapour. Don't you see why that's insane? Oh, so I'm crazy now? Comfortable, Mike? Yeah. What about you, man, you comfortable? No. Don't ever touch a black man's radio. Chris Tucker, Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way. Thank you. I haven't been to New York in a long time. Big Apple. Maybe I'll stay overnight. I got a cousin who lives down there. How will we get home? Oh, you can stay, too. He's got a big place. Maybe I'll stay. It's not that big. Buses, though, will get you home quick. And then all of a sudden Dwight stood up and was like, "No!" Then what did he do? Well, you should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. Dunder Mifflin, customer service. This is Kelly. Oh, yeah, I can totally help you with that. Okay. Let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams? Hey, guys. Jan is ready for you. Okay. Okay. Bring it home now. And don't forget the new black-man phrase I taught you. Pippety poppety, give me the zoppety. Yes, sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me. All right. Yeah. I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise. I just can't help myself. Hey, man I'm sorry. Thanks. Can I, like, see you after work for coffee or something? I don't know. Please. I just got some stuff I got to say to you. Jim. Roy. Look out! Thanks, Kev. I'm good, though. Thank you, Hunter. Hello. Come in. Okay. Who is the boy toy? That's my new assistant. Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek? I have to call you the second I get a new assistant now? Be nice to get a memo. We are lovers. Hi, Jan. Hi, Toby. First First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear? Bippety, boppety. Right now, we can offer you a six-percent raise. Six percent? After all we've been through? Oh, God. I got you jade earrings. Michael. No. No. No. Michael. You're going to play it like this? You give me a good raise or no more sex. What are you writing, perv-ball? Just preparing for the deposition. This may the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest, scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial. I'm so sorry, Pammy. I mean, I wasn't going to do anything, but then I kept thinking about you two together. I just thought you guys were really good friends or maybe he was gay or something. Not that that's wrong. I'm sorry, too. I just I think that we both made some bad choices. So, you going to start dating Halpert then? No. No. He has a girlfriend. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute, you broke up our wedding for the guy. No. There were a lot of reasons. What, you're not even going to try to go out with him? I don't get you, Pam. I know. What's this? What's what? "Certificate of Bravery from the Scranton Police Department "recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man, "Dwight K. Schrute. " Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice honor. Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look, there's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. Didn't think you'd notice. Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart? This is me, Jan. This is me. Okay. Michael, please. You know, why don't we just take a break? Okay. This is This is going nowhere. No. No. No. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere. Okay, Toby, how about if you Sure. Great. What's wrong with you? I don't know. Was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then your assistant is all young and hot and I Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12-percent raise, but you have got to ask for 15. That's ridiculous. I'm never going to No, just I just need you to ask for it so I can record that you asked for it. Okay? Ah so. All right, Levinson, here's the rub. I would like a 15-percent raise. No, but we can offer you 12. But you just said 15. Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win, win, win. But, you know, life is about more than just salary. It's about perks. Like having sex with Jan Michael. So, you and Bob are looking at a historical house? Near the river. How many bedrooms? Four. Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading. Really? Tales of bravery. Good stuff? I was thinking tonight we could read it together. That sounds fun. I will never say a word. And now we are even. I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back, got a second chance and I'm not going to blow it. So, look out, Dunder Mifflin. I mean "look out" in a fun way. You know, not like, "I'm going to hurt you. " Hey, guys, guess who's back? Oh, God! No need to thank me. I'm not a hero. I'm a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro from Heroes. That's a hero. Also Bono.
Good morning, Pam. Oh, welcome back, Andy. Drew. I'm Drew now. Oh, Drew. Sorry. Apology not accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. But after five weeks in anger management, I'm back, and I've got a new attitude and a new name and a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies. Morning, Jim. Hey, Andy. How are you, man? Good. Drew. What's that? You can call me Drew. No, I'm not gonna call you that. Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do. Andy. Drew. Dwight. How's it going, man? Yes. I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned? Andy, Dwight says welcome back and that he could use a hug. Okay. Tell him that that's not true. Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks. Okay. No, Jim. You guys. Tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim, tell him! Andy No, it's too far. Damn you. Today is safety training day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. But I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation at the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity. Now, this is the forklift. You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. Quiz. Mike. Should you drive the forklift? I can and I have. No, no, no! I said, "Should you?" You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift. You understand? You're not allowed to drive the forklift. It's not safe. You don't have a license. Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. Pudge has driven the forklift. Madge. I thought your name was Pudge. No. It's always been Madge. Okay. Her. Her? Yes, "Her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay? Fine. Do you understand that? Yes. We do safety training every year or after an accident. We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled Hey, Darryl, how's it hanging? And I fell and busted my ankle and I'm legitimately scared for my workers. The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat. Yeah! How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler? Bale 'er? I hardly know her. Damn it, Michael, pay attention, man. Anybody want to take a guess? Five bucks says it's over fifty. You really want to bet? Anybody? Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored. How many? Okay. You're on. Ten people. Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them? No, don't worry about it. We'll just go double or nothing. On what? I don't know. I'll figure something out. Nice. What are you guys talking about? These are very dangerous machines down here and the upstairs workers Michael? should not go anywhere near them. Yes. Yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world It would be the worst thing in the world. It would. What the hell is wrong with this man? Very much so. It's a big red trash compactor. It's not a trash compactor! It's very dangerous, okay. Don't disrespect a baler, Mike. All right, all right, I got it! I got it! Only on the rarest of occasions would I go near No, you don't touch it! There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay? Toby now has the floor and he is going to try not to screw this up like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go! Okay, one thing you're going to want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a 10-minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're going to want to get up out of your chairs and move around for about 10 minutes every hour. Yes. Good. Fine. Like stretching and Yeah, your computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so it's also recommended that you step away for about 10 minutes every hour. Wow? That is That time really adds up. That's like a half an hour, every hour? Take them at the same time. Okay. You know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not? No. No. You always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort in case it gets drafty. What about a long-sleeved tee? That will work. Long johns? A shawl? You know, anything that warms you. Okay, you know what, I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. Sorry. He is very lame. Let's see. Seasonal affective disorder. A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter. Thank God we only had a baler to deal with. Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it? Okay. Guys, you know what? I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation. Actually, you did. Yes. Okay. Let's do another one. This is a good one. A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary lifestyle which can contribute Sedentary. Yes. Which can contribute to heart disease. Heart disease kills more people than balers. That's called having a fat butt, Michael. No. No, it's sedentary. Yeah, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from? You have fat butt disease, Michael? Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds. Yeah? Yeah. I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you? Ryan! Dude, please tell your girl to shut up. What? Kelly, you've insulted the gentleman. Please apologize. Are you kidding me? All right, we out of here. Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours, so Yeah, but ours was real, Michael. Yes. That's what we've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness. Nerf ball. You live a sweet little nerfy life sitting on your biscuit never having to risk it. Okay. What? So, Nerf isn't cool anymore? Darryl thinks he's such a man because he works in a warehouse. Well, big deal! I worked in a warehouse. Men's Wearhouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. He'd probably make them feel like wimps. Not me, I Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Wearhouse. We have a special on khaki pants today. This is one example. Ten. Really? Ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant. There's, like, Forty-two. I'm going to say 50. Don't be that person. Oh, come on. That is lame. It's a strategy. It's called being smart. Thank you. Oh, jeez. I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun. Ten. Ten's out. Damn it! Forty-seven, 48, forty-nine. Jim wins. That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours. Okay. Okay. No, constantly. Like for years. Okay. Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right? I don't understand the question. Working in an office can lead to depression, which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff. Yeah. Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler. And yet those guys are making fun of me, calling me a Nerf. That It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals. Yeah. You are so right. They have visual aids and all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball and your hair sticks up straight. And you know science. So, you're okay? Indubitably. They used props, they used visual aids and they just made us look like dopes. Idiots! God, what are we going to do? I don't know. I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression. Wolves. Depression. Visual aids. Yes. A quilt. A depression quilt. No time to sew a quilt. I got it. Get me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store. You may be asking yourself what am I doing on a trampoline? Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress and then move on with my day. Not. Here's a plan. Dwight is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys and we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh, my God, he is on the roof. And now I have got their attention. I tell them about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, "Hey, you ever seen a suicide?" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note, they might think, "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael. " But that's not why I'm doing this. Then I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner, ta-freaking-da. So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etcetera, etcetera. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome. And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see Love Actually again, but it's at the bottom of the queue. Oh, no, what do I do? What I do is this. I go online, I go click, click, click and I change the order of the queue, so that I can see Love Actually as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works? I guess I forgot. You're such a ditz. Ryan, well done. Two minutes, 42 seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win $10 because she said "awesome" 12 times. And Jim, you win $5 because she mentioned six romantic comedies. Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops! Maybe we should test this first. Letterman style. Throw a TV over or We measured it once. Go buy some watermelons. Seedless? Just Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato. Hey, Creed. Hey. Yes! Here you go. What? Nice! I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out. Ready? Let's do it. Drop that sucker. Yeah! Bingo! Deactivate the car alarm, clean up the mess. Okay. Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes. Got it. Also, take apart the trampoline. Stick it in the baler. We're not allowed to use the baler. Have Padge do it or the sea monster. I'm on it. I'm temporarily lifting the shun. Thank you. It means nothing. I need you to do something for me. Anything. Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house andlor castle. You mean a Moonbounce. What do you think? You've got an hour. I'm going to need petty cash. Shunning resumed. Do you want a drawbridge? Un-shun. Yeah, that sounds good. Re-shun. Oh, yeah, this is much better. It's safer. Excellent decision. Yes. Thank you for seeing that. When you land, try and land like an eight-year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults. I don't know if I want to do this. Want to do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk. No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing them, I'm not going to want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking. Right! Doing! Totally doing! Let's rock and roll! Rock and roll! Yeah! That's right, I'm not thinking! Yes! Yeah! Michael is awesome Jumping off the roof Bouncing on a bouncy thing Show them who is boss Rip a hole in the sun! I am ready to do this! I'm ready to make a point! Hey! Guys, listen up, Michael is up on the roof and acting strange. What's the situation? Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun. Okay, when is the shunning thing going to end? Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die. Is it nice outside? It's gorgeous. Let's go! Do I need my jacket? No, it really is. It's very nice. Come on! Will I be too warm in a long-sleeved tee? Everyone's going to be fine in exactly what they're wearing! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Hurry up, you guys! My life! Oh, my life! Michael, what's wrong? Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office has caused me to go into a depression! Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32,000 people commit suicide every year according to a 2004 study. Is that the last year the data was available? Yes. My head is in such pain and turmoil. Don't do anything rash. Dwight, where are the warehouse guys? I didn't I didn't think you needed them for this part. Okay. That's You said to just That's the whole point, dummy. Okay. I'm on it. Okay? Attention, blue-collar workers! What are the odds that this is in any way real? I'd say, like, 10,000 to one. Okay, I'd like 10 bucks on those odds. If someone gives you 10,000 to one on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude. Michael is up on the roof and he's acting strange. Oh, my life. Michael, what's wrong? Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office has made me depressed. Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? Dwight, you ignorant slut! Well, you know, the first performance was a little off, but I really think they hit their stride in the second show. I might even bring my parents tomorrow to the matinee. And that is why Oh, excuse me. It's my favorite part. I am going to jump off this roof! This is just offensive. At least we're outside. Hey, check it out, there's a castle over there. Oh, my God, there is a castle. No. There's nothing to see over there, people. There's nothing to see. They found the castle, Michael. Damn it! Oh, God. Oh, my God, he's going to jump. He's going to kill himself pretending to kill himself. Yeah. Excuse me. Hey, Michael, don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that 'cause you're going to get horribly, horribly injured. Hey, Michael, I have a present for you but you have to come down and get it. What is it? Come down and open it and you'll see. Dwight, find out what the present is. Okay, I don't see anything. She might be bluffing. Dwight. Dwight. It's a A Repliee-Q-One-Expo female robot. They're only available in Japan. Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really what is it? Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're going to seriously hurt yourself. You told me that I lead a A cushy, wimpy Nerf life. Yeah. But I never said you had nothing to live for. What do I have to live for? A lot of things. You What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's going good, right? It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be. Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well you got to be you. Do you really mean that? I couldn't do it. I ain't that strong and I ain't that brave. I'm braver than you? Way braver. You Braveheart, man. I Braveheart. I am. Come on down, okay? Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present. An office is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say, but yes.
It's kind of blurry. That's better. Question, what kind of bear is best? That's a ridiculous question. False. Black bear. Well, that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought. Fact, bears eat beets. Oh Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica. Bears do not What is going on? What are you doing? Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Four dollars. And it only cost me $7 to recreate the rest of the ensemble and that's a grand total of $11. You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So I thank you. Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year! Michael! Oh, that's funny. Michael! Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations? Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of it. Yes, I'm upset. Don't I sound upset? Okay. It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to be recalling all of that paper. We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24-pound cream letter stock. Five-hundred boxes has gone out with the image of a beloved cartoon duck performing unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan. Everybody in here, stat. No time to lose. Cri-man squa, F and C, double-time. "Cri-man squa"? Crisis management squad. "F and C, double-time"? Front and center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions? One more. Why are you talking like that? To save time, Jim. Actually, I think you could make the argument that it wastes time. Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it Okay, okay, okay it actually took up more time. You know what? Forget it! Where is Creed? Creed. Here. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on this one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy. Every week, I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens. We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today. That's not really our job. Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry. Kelly will be training you first. Kelly's training us? This day is bananas B- A-N-A-N-A-S This day is bananas B- A-N-A I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing. Jim. Big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High School, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids. Yeah, I got a call in already. No, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school in person. All right. I want you to bring a partner. I'll go. No, sweet cheeks. We need somebody who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go. William Dolittle at your service, a. k.a. Will Do. Yeah, I'm definitely going to go alone. No! No! I need two men on this! That's what she said. No time! But she did. No time! Guys! Get on this! Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference. Yes! You are entering the no-spin zone! We're having a press conference? No, Pam. The press is just going to find out by themselves. Not. Here's the thing, when a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J. I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here and meet with me for a personal apology. The press wants a story? I will give them a story. Oh, did the press ask for a story? Here is your headline, "Scranton Area Paper Company" "Dunder Mifflin Apologizes to Valued Client. " "Some Companies Still Know How Business is Done. " Okay? Battle stations, everybody! Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Yes. Hello. Creed Bratton, quality assurance, Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there, and I'm trying to remember who it was. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday the 11th. Perfect. The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did when I was a homeless man. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers. So give yourselves a round of applause. I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls. I know, right? Probably a lot. Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go? Okay, Angela, I love your enthusiasm! All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say, "Customer service, this is Kelly. " Except don't say, "Kelly. " Say your own name. Or if you're bored, you could just make up a name. Like, one time, I said I was Bridget Jones And I talked like this for the whole conversation. Oh! Can I be Australian, mate? Absolutely! Hello, mate! I like ice cream. I need a boyfriend. I like ice cream, too, mate! Alligators. Dingo babies. Beer me. What's that? Hand me that water. I always say, "Beer me. " Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's her name? You know her name. Who? Karen? Yeah. She's only one of my oldest friends. How's the apartment hanging? It's fine. Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold I bet. What about music? You have any music? Yeah, you should have said so. Give me the beat boys and free my soul I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away Give me the beat boys and free my little ol' soul I was thinking more like a CD or A CD? Your call, dude. My girlfriend made me an awesome mix. Beer me that disc. Lord, beer me strength. So, Tuna, when we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay? Did that really need to be said? Well, not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of a conversation. What the Why is my girlfriend here? Oh, she that teacher in the white? No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef. Which one is she? The one in the green hoodie. Wow. I wonder if she's like a guidance counselor or something. No. I don't think so. She's, like, probably a tutor Nope. She probably teaches No. There's no Okay, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice. On it. Okay, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair. First rule in roadside beet sales, put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow. "I need this beet right now. " Those are the money beets. Hey. Look sharp. Hey. Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute. Hi. And you must be from the Washington Post. Scranton Times. Chad Lite, Lighter Side of Life. And breaking corporate news. And obits. Oh, dear God. Okay. Here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance. Don't get too excited. That's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the pressroom shortly. Have a seat. Can I get you a beverage? Yeah, I'd like a Great. Oh. Andy, you know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably Jamie! Andy Oh What are you doing here? Andy? Are you a student here? Oh, yeah. You never told me you were in high school! This is weird. I got to go to Spanish. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I had no idea. Well, that's not going to hold up in court. We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. Sir Yes, you have a valid point Okay. and I'm sorry. Yes. No, I am so sorry. Really? Dixon City? I have an aunt in Carbondale. Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. Okay, first, I just want to say that you are doing so good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might want to work on is apologizing. When I went over Wednesday for the spot-check, I get a call from Debbie Brown saying she has an emergency dentist appointment. Emergency dentist appointment? Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would've caught this. Yes. I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye. Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Mrs. Allen is our most important client. Because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really. And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And as a gesture of gratitude for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check for six months of free paper or You look good in this. So, let us consider this matter ended. Well, it isn't ended. I'm very angry. I could have lost business. I know. I know you are angry and we are truly, truly sorry. I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying. Well, we are extremely sorry. I don't accept. I'll be with you in a moment. All right. Who was that guy she was talking to at her locker? Not important because you're not dating her, because it's a felony. But who was that guy? Probably another high school student. The issue with the watermark is very serious. Absolutely. We teach our students that character counts. And you should. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch. Know what? Andy is having a real rough day today. I want to take out an ad in your yearbook. Full page, two words. "Good luck. " That's not what I had in mind. Ask where he's from. Absolutely. Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? He's upset about the watermark. Okay, great. Now, just tell him that it was an unfortunate error and we are doing everything we can do to fix it and that you're sorry. It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back. And you're sorry. And the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. I think he had Tourette's or something! We are going to do everything humanly possible to ensure that this never happens again. Well, it doesn't help. Why? Because it already happened to me. The watermark, it's a one-time thing. I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having sex? May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling. Okay. I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doing a goat. Couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right. What can I do for you? All right. For starters, I think that you should resign. Okay. Well, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the paper mill You're the head The guy at the paper mill's No, no, no. You're the head of the company! I'm the head of the company? Yes, and that makes it your responsibility No, I'm a regional manager! and so you should lose your job! No What? Okay. This is insane. You can get out of here. Get out. That's insane. Fine. I will give this to somebody who will appreciate it. It's non-transferable. Doesn't matter. Out please! I'm calling the Better Business Bureau! Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Biatch Hotline! Did you get all that? Everything. We've gotta do something. This is all spinning out of control, Pam. This is just not It's just the Scranton Times. No, then Newsweek picks it up and then CNN does a story about it and then YouTube gets a hold of it. You know what? I really think the whole thing is just going to blow over in like a week or two. You're right. It will blow over. But it's not going to take a week or two. Do you know what this is for? Yes. Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch. Okay, I think that's good. Hello, I am Michael Scott, regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. By now, you're probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team to remove me from this office and maybe not even then. You could never withstand a SWAT team. That's how devoted I am to this job. I'm just saying I know. They would flank you, throw in a concussion grenade. I understand that, Dwight. You'd be on the ground Do you think you're taking it a little  blind, deaf, dumb. literally, Dwight? If you wanted to be And now we're wasting tape. I'm going to have to cut this all out. Can you say cut Cut.  so I'll know where to Cut. I'm asking Pam to do it, please. Cut. Okay. Ready? Kevin, what's four plus seven? Eleven. Yeah, well, you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form. Yeah? Well, at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oh, yes! Facial. Yes. You two are apes. I expect you to apologize for that, Angela. I'm sorry that you're both morons! Oh, but you still said, "I'm sorry. " I called you morons. Still said it. Still said it, so Five, four, three There is no way I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember, it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day. One day for what? That's They always give an ultimatum. Okay. Good? Cut? Cut. That was your best apology video ever. I thought so, too. I got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there. Unfortunately, she's got some children. I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card. Maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. It is just tragic. You want music? I don't care. Come on, man. Just give it a couple of days. I think you'll be all right. Yeah. You know what? I don't Sweet. Pam. Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today. I look like an idiot! Hey, Karen. Hey, Dwight. Looking sharp. Yeah, that's 'cause I'm your boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen. Wanna get together later and have sexual intercourse 'cause you're my girlfriend? Do you? No. Okay. I'm good. Thanks. Look at that. I'm Jim Halpert. Spot on. A little comment.
Hey. Hey. Oh, what's this? That is a demerit. "Jim Halpert. Tardiness. " Oh. I love it, already. You've got to learn, Jim. You are a second in command, but that does not put you above the law. Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions. Like, what does a demerit mean? Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those. Lay it on me. Three demerits, and you'll receive a citation. Now, that sounds serious. Oh, it is serious. Five citations, and you're looking at a violation. Four of those, and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that will land you in a world of hurt, in the form of a disciplinary review, written up by me, and placed on the desk of my immediate superior. Which would be me. That is correct. Okay. I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full desaggelation. What's a What's that? Oh, you don't want to know. Hey, Phyllis. Are you all right? I think I just got flashed. What? Really? In the parking lot. Oh, my God. Move! Okay, I'll call the real police. What happened? What can I do to help? Okay. I'll check the web. Thank you. The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls. Can you tell us what happened? I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out on the map. Phyllis. You're a married woman. The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss? If that's flashing, then lock me up. It's just, like, so creepy. Yeah. What's happening? Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot. Really? Is she okay? Yeah. Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down. Okay. Phyllis, you say? What is so funny? I mean, did he even see Pam? Or, Karen from behind? I'm guessing not. I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it. Not really. No. It's disgusting and demeaning. Oh, okay. Masters of comedy, a guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? Okay. He's back! Okay. Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the What? What's going on? Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response. Oh, come on. We're laughing at Phyllis but she's not even here. So, no harm, no foul. I don't think the women in this office Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher. I was at a parent-teacher conference. Prove it. Let's see your penis. I You know As that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong. In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time, she pretended she didn't hear me. Michael, come over after work tonight, okay? I miss your body. I don't know. I feel I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tools. Okay. I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser. That I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable. $300? Well I don't know. Look, whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka. Okay? Hunter, are you on? You got it, Jan. The employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better a thousand innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free. I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house. Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on. There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert. This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight. Look at that one. Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say. Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis, I think you know what I'm referring to, Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force. Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces? Answer. No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know what you're thinking. Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community? Phallus? Phyllis. Sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody. I don't often miss Roy, but I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's I'm I am saying a lot of things. I didn't really get a good look. That's okay. I don't feel like answering phones. Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup "or heels exceeding one-quarter inch. "Females are not allowed to speak to strangers "unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute. " This is ridiculous. Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen. Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting. Desperate times call for desperate measures. "Sleeves down to the wrists"? "Button-up collars and muted colors. " Nobody dresses like that. Okay. You know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put them in a burlap sack, and hit them with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that. Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect. See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight? Yes. Did you hear that, Michael? No, Dwight. Respect. R- E-S-P-C-T. Find out what it means to me. All right. You know what? That's it. Conference room. Five minutes. Women's appreciation. Wait a second. How are you qualified for that? Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one? Less than three. That is not current. You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual. Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls. Those are collectible action figures. And they're worth more than your car. You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women. I would like to apologize for all the men who thought this was a laughing matter. Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal? Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited. I don't remember doing that. What a surprise. Okay. No catfights. Please? Let's My point is My point is A penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie. Alien. What? Shut it. Shut up. Okay. So, what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So, what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. F.Y.I. Because I am so angry over all of this. If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models. Yes, Andy. Then, the fashion models could come here and work with me. What you're saying is extremely misogynistic. Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And it proves my point. Women can do anything. I'm saying that you're being sexist. No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist. That's the same thing. Michael. Yes. When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian. Because That was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut. And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods. I have to know whether you're serious or not. I wish I could menstruate. If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides. Can we just get back to work? Yes. Okay. Yes. This is not work talk. You're right. You're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? Steamtown Mall. Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car, so I can do that. Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible sales people making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior section. There are petite adults who are sort of smaller who need to wear, maybe, a kids' size 10. Okay! Let's go, ladies of Dunder Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. Let's go! Are you finished with the sketch? Yeah. Doesn't seem like the type. Phyllis got a good look. I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide. Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead. Thanks. I know how to drive. Oh. Yeah. You really shouldn't litter. My car. My rules. Hey, Jim. You want to go in the women's bathroom? No. Thank you, though. You aren't curious? Not really. I've seen a bathroom before. Yeah, but, it's every guy's fantasy. I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it. Yeah. I'm going in. Go crazy. Oh, my God. I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today. Of course you do, moonface. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So, start hanging these all around the building. This guy looks like a real deviant. No duh. That's why we've got to catch him. Start hanging those. Aye, aye, Captain. More like, aye, aye, General. I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it! It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot. Many women are competent drivers. Okay. Come on. This is what we know. Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool. Yes. Hey, where did you decide to take Karen tonight? Anna Maria's. What's the occasion? Six-month anniversary. What? Nothing. I think, we all kind of thought you guys were just, like, hooking up. No. We've been dating for six months. She might mention an e-mail that I wrote a while back. Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend. I figured. That's cool. I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship, anyway. All right. I hope nobody's on a diet. Thanks, Michael. Thank you, Michael. You're welcome. You're welcome. Okay. So. Let's dish. What do you want to dish about? Anything you guys want. This is your time. What is a Pap smear? Or is it shmear like cream cheese? Okay. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan? Awesome. Awful, I mean. But, sometimes awesome. What What do you think of role-play? It can be fun. Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy. That's a pretty common one. I just I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. Okay. I'm gonna be at the doll store. Sometimes the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So, I am forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls. Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with. Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex. Oh, my God. And then, watching it back right afterward to improve my form. That is not healthy behavior. No. It's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it. Michael, you need to get out of this. No. She's just fooling around. It's a woman thing. No. Normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. No. No, that's all right. I'm okay. I'm okay. You guys, what am I gonna do about Jan? Done. Read the pros first. Okay. "Jan is smart, successful. "Good clothes. Hot. "Perfect skin. Nice butt. " She does have very nice clothes. Okay, okay. Cons? Cons. "Wears too much makeup. "Breasts not anything to write home about. "Insecure about body. "I'm unhappy when I'm with her. "Flat-chested. " What was the last one? She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles. No. The one before that. "I'm unhappy when I'm with her. " Michael. You shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy. I'm happy sometimes. When we scrapbook. Or right towards the end of having sex. Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes. Yeah. That's smart. Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other. That sounds good, too. I don't know who's right. I just don't. I don't know. I don't know. I bet you know. Don't think. Just answer. What do you want to do about Jan? I want to break up with Jan. Wow! I want to break up with Jan. My mom taught me that. Wow! I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories. No one said it has no calories. Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item, on me. As a thank you. Come on. Get in here. Let's face it. Most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're cavemen. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing eight-inch heels. And to be wearing see-through underpants. But for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked. This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often. I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time. What are you doing in here? This is the woman's room. You're in here. I pay for that privilege. Okay. I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times, and I have paid dearly. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties, or Like, a thong or G- string, T-back? Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through? Push-up? Lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Anything. It's just You know what? I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear. Phyllis? What do you think? Too much? Jim's gonna love it. I'm kind of in between boyfriends right now, so I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe. Slower. Slower. Meredith. Slow it up. Oh, no. It's Jan. What do I do? Answer it. Don't answer it. Okay. It stopped. Oh, crap. That is pretty cool. Michael? You know how to change a wheel, right? Yeah. Yep. Can somebody grab me the lever? And I will Here. Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on? Yeah. Get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. There we go! Good. Yes. We have the All right. I think I've got it. Do you have a Crescent? A Crescent-Allen? I don't think we really need that, Michael. You know what? I'm going to You take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic detail. You know? I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. Coming! Think we'll find him? Yeah, I do. Because justice never rests. Halvsies? No. Wholesies. Listen, man. I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot. Natch. Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang up some of these posters around my neighborhood, schools, post office, et cetera. You know? I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. Okay. I am really going to do this. Good luck, Michael. You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. Okay. Remember. Be strong. I love you guys. No, I'm getting her voicemail. Don't leave a Hey, Jan. It's me. Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break. Permanently. And, I know everybody says this, but I want to remain friends. Or, at least, business associates who get along. Oh. Just so you know, it's not me. It's you. Okay, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. So, I'll talk to you later. Michael. I was I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I I just I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So I'm sorry. Thank you. So, we're good? Abso-fruitly. Oh. Hold on. Sorry. No. Wait a second. Oh. It's from you. Want to grab some dinner? Hey, Jan. It's me. Michael. Yeah. Okay. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break. Permanently. And, I know everybody says this, but I want to remain friends. Maybe some Italian. Or, at least, business associates Chinese? get along. Oh. Just so you know, it's not me. It's you. Okay, buddy Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall, and I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela a heart and for Kelly a brain. Michael. How can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them? You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all. Dunder Mifflin Paper I Sex Predator Hotline. This is Dwight Schrute. Hey, Dwight. It's Jim. Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy. No. You're not. I'm looking right at you. I'm hanging up. Don't. I have information about the sex predator.

Sometimes Michael? you just gots to get your freak on. Michael? Yeah? Michael? I am calling to see if you would come down and interview for a job we have opening up in corporate. Really? A week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who'd take over the Scranton branch. Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say. That's not necessary. May God guide you in your quest. Yes. Okay. Everybody have their towels and swimsuits? We've got an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now, and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Oh, I'm excited. Today is Beach Day. Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt. Oh, yeah. I packed it in my purse. Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume? I don't wear a Speedo, Michael. Well, you can't swim in leather pants. I'm just yanking your chain. Not literally. Anybody need sun block? I've got SPF 30. Oh. You know what? You're not going. It's Beach Day. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Toby, we Somebody has to stay here. I want today to be a beautiful memory that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby's a part of it, then it'll suck. Hey. You want my sunscreen? Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two-piece. Thanks, Toby. Hey, Pam. I have a very important job for you today. I thought we were just having fun at the beach. We are. We are. But I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. You know, not their hotness, per se, but their humor and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me. What happens to a company if somebody takes a boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head. You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities? I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day and then type it up in a way that is helpful. All right? I have the most boring job in the office. So why wouldn't I have the most boring job on Beach Day? This way to the party bus. I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted. And the night got deathly quiet And his face lost all expression Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy "You gotta learn to play it right "You got to know when to hold 'em "Know when to fold 'em" Yeah. "Know when to walk away Know when to run "You never count your money "When you're sitting at the table "There'll be time enough for counting "When the dealing's done" Everybody, may I have your attention, please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach. Oh, sweet mother of God. If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus. Excuse me? Or the front of the bus or drive the bus. Just We are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities. And there is a special secret prize for the winner. Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach. Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off. I hope there will be management parables. Well Hey, Pam. Did you get that down? Like what? Like everything I said and everything they did, and just I don't know exactly Don't Write it down before you forget it. That's You've just been drawing pictures. I can't stay mad at you. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. Watch out for snakes. Everybody, put on sunscreen. All right. Find a cozy spot. Everybody, settle in. Okay, everybody up. Circle around. Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton, America's eighth-largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, fourteen strangers who work together, but only one survivor. What? Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy, and Stanley. Yes! Choose your tribes. Except for Pam, not Pam. Jim Halpert. Karen. Pros: Smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: Not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in half an hour. So that should tell you something. I choose Michael! I'm not playing. Okay. Temp. Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot. We are going to choose team names. Dwight. We will be called Gryffindor. Really? Not Slytherin? Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort. He Who Must Not Be Named? I wouldn't do that. Voldemort. Voldemort. Okay, seriously Voldemort. Voldemort.  you really shouldn't be saying Voldemort. Voldemort. Idiots. Idiots. Okay, okay. Stanley, your team name? I don't care what you call my team. Then I will name your team the Red Team. No, the Blue Team. I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done for America. We will be Team USA. Very good. Pam, please, take a note that Andy is patriotic. Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy, he gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him. It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist. There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon. The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please, put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. All right, ready, set, go! Come on, Phyllis, you can do it. Thank you so much. Phyllis is out. Yes! Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving, keep it moving right this way. Looking good. I don't want to hit the big rock. Don't worry, you're not I know I'm near the big rock, I just know it. Nowhere near the big rock. Andy, I don't wanna get hurt by the big rock. What are you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified. I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard. Stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Move it! Just step over the hole. Move your ass! Yup. Come on, lazy-bones! Move it! Come on! Perfect. Just made it. Okay, turn left. Come on! Come on! Andale, Andale! Arriba! You have to stop this right now or I'm not gonna do this anymore. What are you saying? You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race. Okay, I apologize for yelling at you. That's what being a good captain is about. I'm trying to bring team spirit! It's about listening to your team. Whoa, stop. Another hole. Take a big step. I am not hysterical. I am explaining Yes! Oh, my God. You ass. There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf and diligent note-taking. Pam, you're missing things! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on, you bastard! What the Damn it, temp! Great job, everyone, that was fantastic. Okay, Pam, I have another little project for you. Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs? Smart as a whip! Yes. These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it. When's the contest? Like, 10 minutes? How am I supposed to get Thanks a bunch. A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success. Okay, who's hungry? No, no, no, do not touch the food. Please, not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog-eating contest. Oh, God. For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow. And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so that each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, okay? All right! The team that eats the most hot dogs in 10 minutes will be declared the winner! On your mark, get set Can I have a turkey burger? No. I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? Turkey is a healthy meat. Yeah, it's very good for you. I don't eat meat, Michael. I'm not gonna eat this. It has L-tryptophan. Guys, guys. Come on What's L-tryptophan? Please! Let's just Okay, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark, get set, eat! Is there any mustard? No mustard! No mustard! Just eat it! Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily. Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize. What is it? I can't say. You can't say? Or you can't pronounce it? The winner gets regional manager salary for a year and a Sebring and the feeling that they're making a difference in the world. Can we just take those first two things? The winner of today gets my job. Okay? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people, and I'm the most qualified, and I'll probably get it, all right? You're leaving? I didn't wanna tell anybody. I didn't wanna cast a pall over our fun Beach Day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend, because, frankly, nobody's stepping up. I am so hungry. Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis? Word. Here we go. Let's see it. I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on. Come on. Come on. Four seconds. Three, two, one Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard Team USA! with 14 hot dogs! One came up. Thirteen hot dogs, everybody. Damn it! Nobody told me we were gonna have hot dogs. Sabotage. What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me. It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. We don't have any safety mittens. Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's all right. Here we go. Get him, big boy! And go! Come on, Jim! Come on! What are you doing? Come on! Stop. Nice, Stanley! Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight. Yeah. No. Good. Okay. Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes, ever. I thought that I might die. On Beach Day. Come on! Come on! Come on! If either of these guys are put in charge of the office, I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kind of looking for a way out of that relationship, anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. One, two, three! Yeah! Yeah! Excellent! Gryffindor! Gryffindor! Come on! I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work things out with words. That's not why you lost. Yeah, it is. I totally could have kicked your butt. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right! Come on, come on! God! How do you like that? Help. Help! Angela! Angela, hey. Oh, thank God. Go tell somebody. What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them? Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously. I don't understand what you want from me. Angela, it's pretty simple. Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody it! Sorry! Bye, Andy! Angela! I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Jim is not taking it seriously. Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Who's ahead in points? I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim 10 points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs-up. And I don't really know how to compare those units. Well, check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. I really doubt it, Michael. Please, just check. Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you. And here is Karen Filippelli. Bye. Hello? Yeah, hi, David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. "In well"? As well. How would that work, in well? I just want to know. Yes. Wait a minute. That would be fine. If this job is in a well, I don't want it. I don't. What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. How so? I mean, sure thing. That sounds smart. I can't do this anymore. I'm going to sit in the bus. Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have a super-fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory walking through fire! Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. Are you gonna try it? I'm not gonna walk in the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through. Angela, it is a million degrees. I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? No, no. Not you, Pam. You have to keep score. I'd like to try it. Pointless. But I'm not kidding, I really wanna do it. Okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. Nope. Why not? Come on. Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned. You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. That's harsh. Who's next? Andy, where is Andy? Andy is never here today. Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello? Why don't you go, Michael? Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on the George Foreman Grill. That is not the same at all. If you're gonna ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself. All right, okay. All right. Fine. Okay. Okay. Go. The mind has to wrap around the foot. Okay. You want us to count to three? Yes, count to three, please. Three, two, one! Three, two, one! Count the other way. Go. No, no. Count one, two, three. Okay, okay. Not three, two, one. One, two, three. One, two, three. Go! Do it! Go, Michael. Wait. Am I going on "go" or am I going on "three"? On "three". On the "go" that's after "three". Okay. One, two, three, go! One, two, three, go! No! It's okay. I will do this, Michael. Don't, Dwight I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager! Wow. Yes. Dwight. Dwight. Dwight. Keep moving if you're gonna walk there. Keep moving! Keep coming. Give me the job! That's enough! Give me the job! I'm not going to give it to you! Don't kneel on the coals! Oh, my God! Michael, do something! God, that stinks! Dwight, stop it! Being a boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just I don't see the connection between a fire walk and management. Worst $75 I ever spent. You know what? If I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. Outside Hire. Or Mrs. Outside Hire. Yeah. True. Look, I don't I don't wanna leave this branch that I love to an outside hire. Therefore, we're going to have a 100-point, winner-take-all, sudden death, Tribal Council round to test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. Who's Bob Hope? God. He's He's a comedian. Oh, like Amanda Bynes. Who's Amanda Bynes? She's from What a Girl Wants. Oh, I love that movie. Yes. Kelly is right. The person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor. And they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So, without further ado, Jim and Dwight. Show us what you've got. Hey. I know what you're looking for, but I gotta be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. You are being too modest. Michael, on Thursday, I'm gonna drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. Okay, that is not funny. I am deducting 60 points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight, your turn. Wow us. The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act. " And the man says something really, really raunchy. And the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats. " I mean, truly repulsive acts. That is a very, very funny story. Hey. I wanna say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately, and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk. Just I did it. Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss. Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just, like, weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford. And I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's fine. It's Whatever. That's not what I'm I'm not Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim, and to everyone else in the circle, I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am gonna go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day. Pam! That was amazing! But I am still looking for someone with a sales background. Flintstones. Meet the Flintstones They're a modern stone age family From the town of Bedrock They're a page right out of history Let's ride with the family down the street Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet When you're with the Flintstones You'll have a yabba dabba doo time A dabba doo time You'll have a gay, old time! Wilma! Nice.
David Oh, Michael Are we all set? Isn't our interview tomorrow? Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood. Thought I'd drop in and say hello. Just happened to be in midtown Manhattan? Thought I'd catch a show. In the middle of a workday? No. You know what, since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. Okay. How many people are you interviewing? We're only interviewing branch managers and some lower-level company people. Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity, are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have or manages more people? I don't think so. Great. One more question. When you merged those branches, who did you put in charge? I believe we put you in charge. Ah, great. No further questions. Okay, Michael. Okay. I'm really looking forward to our interview. And I'm really looking forward to working with you. I have got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. Hey, Pam, yeah, I forgot what day the interview was. I drove to New York accidentally. Be, like, three hours late. See, I have 600 Yeah, I don't have Hey. Hey, Kev. What's different about you? You look worse. Thank you. You got a haircut. It's sexy hot. Oh. Turn around. No. Come on. No, thanks. Do it! Look at that do! What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. Andy. What is it, Big Haircut? No. Sorry, I can't hear you, Big Haircut. Yep. What? Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow, so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless. Hey. I think it looks great. Thanks, Pam. After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship, too, and I would always mean a lot to him. And I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarrassed at all. It needed to be said and I said it and it only took me three years to summon the courage. So, thank you. Yeah? You wanted to see me? Yes. The time has come to name my own replacement. So Please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. But that's my name. "Dwight, congratulations, a-wipe. " "Don't screw the pooch. " Thank you. Okay. All right. Thank you, Michael. Okay. Thank you so much. Hey, stop crying. Thank you. Hey. Hey. About the beach It's okay. We all say things without thinking. Oh, no. It's not that. I've actually been thinking that for a long time and I'm glad I said it. I just am sorry if it made you feel weird. Oh. Okay. Pam is kind of a bitch. Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit? I just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it. So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early because we wanted to spend the night in the city. Why, so you can do it? Whoops. No, well, I was thinking that, actually, we can all leave tomorrow and do a convoy, you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger. Moon each other. We're going to go tonight, but we're going to see you there tomorrow morning, right? All right. All right. Your loss. Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving? Cruise control. Oh. So, Jim, who do you think is hotter, Pam or Karen? Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. Pam is taller. You sure? Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. Wow. But I think Karen has a prettier face. What else? Well, I mean, Pam's face is really pretty, too. It's a very tough call. Really tough call. Yeah. You know what, why don't you take the rest of the day and figure it out and then come back and tell me what you've got. Will do. All right. Yes. Hey, Pam, I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. That's very funny. I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. Are you kidding? I would never have done that. It was Patheticville. No offense, Pam. You know what, don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. I remember. I blogged the whole thing. Www. creedthoughts. gov. Wwwlcreedthoughts. Check it out. Last year, Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain, I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the Internet, it's pretty shocking. There they are, the accounting department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. Do you think it's going to be weird working with Jan in New York? No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up. And I think if she had something to say, she would have called me. Maybe you should talk to her before No, no, no, no. You know what, it's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. Michael. What? Why? I'm sorry that just doesn't make sense. Yes. Why Who gave you that advice? Yeah, Michael, you should never I sell your condo. I have to buy another place. But you said you were in debt. I'm not. You're not sure that you have the job. I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated as was I. It went for 80% of what I paid. Sold in record time. How would you like to spend the night with the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton? No, Dwight, I don't care if that's how they consolidated power in ancient Rome, I'm No, no. Not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job. Not now. Goodbye, Kelly Kapour. Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. Oh, hey, Dwight. I am going to be your new boss. It is my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check-in time is now. Checkout time is never. Does my room have cable? No. And the sheets are made of fire. Can I change rooms? Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. Can I have a late checkout? I'll have to talk to the manager. You're not the manager? Even in your own fantasy? I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan. Okay. Just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy, you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the Devil. Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. Go. $80,000 a year. Once I am officially regional manager, my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable, fictional, and overqualified. I will see you at the interview. Yes, you will. Who is D. Abramson? He's from that company in Pittsburgh. Michael. Why are you here? How are you? I'm good. How are you, Janet? I'm I'm great. It's good to see you. Can we Can we talk privately for a minute? Why privately? I just I don't I don't like the way that we left things. Okay, sure. Fine. Why don't you wait in my office? I have some important business matters to take care of. Okay. Okay. Pam, DEFCON 10. Houston, we have a problem. What do you want me to do? I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room, Phyllis, Angela, Karen. What about Meredith? No. She's an alternate. So, how you been? I'm good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I I tried calling, but I kept getting voicemail. Weird. Yeah. I didn't get both of your messages. So, Michael needs us in the conference room. Oh, is it Jan again? Hey, before I leave tonight, would you mind making half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? Sure. Thanks. I really hope you get the job. Thanks. After you ended everything with us, I went on a vacation to kind of clear my mind. Sounds good. Sounds fun. It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I should just Get right to the point, you know. Okay. I I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time, and I've made some big changes in my life, and I miss you. I want us to get back together. Would you excuse me for a second? Oh. DEFCON 20. She wants to get back together. What are you going to do? I don't know. That's why you're here. Help me. Please. Would you want to get back together with her? No. No. What do I do? Just don't get back together with her. What if she makes me? How can she make you get back together with her? She made me do a lot of things I didn't want to do. This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. I wasn't. You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. You're right. You are absolutely right. I need to go in there and tell her that we can't be together. Right. Wow. Do it. I'm in a very good place right now. Okay. Thank you. Go. Okay. Jan, we need to talk. Jan is in a different place right now. And it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I'm going to hear her out. Oh, my God. Yeah. Bigger actually. That's crazy. Oh, my God. Can you believe that? Unbelievable. Wow! She could put the cup right there. I know. No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around that one time. I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than to the front. I love fake boobs. Oftentimes you find them on strippers. I find it offensive. Au naturel, baby. That's how I like them. Swing low, sweet chariots. So, there are a lot of things I would like to do differently. Yeah. I feel like when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities. First stop, priorities. And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation. Let's get back together. No. No, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is emotionally magnificent. Okay, everyone, listen up! Time to begin the interview process. Andrew Bernard. Save the best for first. All right, you guys, see you later. Wish us luck. No. Hey, hey, do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael. Good luck, you guys. Good luck. What did I say? Good luck. Thanks. I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche sounds cliche. Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care because I am what I am. That's Popeye. I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color? White. Because it contains all other colors. Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table? You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. What is the capital of Maine? The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York where I went to Cornell. Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't want to hear about it. Forget your personal history and learn the history of this company. Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say? I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has, my brain, which I use to my advantage when advantageous. Time! No, you failed. Damn it! This interview is over. I'll let you know. Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. Totally. No problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way? My assistant? Or Oh, you know, I'm going to have a congratulations Karen party tomorrow night at a friend's house. Oh, wow. That sounds fun. Is your friend named Karen, too? What did she accomplish? No. I'm sorry, I should have been clearer. It's for me. Oh. Because I'm going to get the job. How remarkable. Thanks. Wait, wait a second. Oh. Let me check one more thing. Okay. Very good. All right, well, I have to get back. But I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? Yes, indeed. Good luck with your interview. Thank you. Bye. So I guess we're getting back together. What happened? Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly, we didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery. So, we have all night. Where do you want to go first? I don't know. How about the UN? How often do you come here? Every time my sixth grade class was on a field trip. I think you're really going to enjoy this, adult Jim. Hey, everybody, the next time you see me I will be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, I would like to start saying my goodbyes. For everything you've done You know I'm bound Okay. I'm bound to thank you for it Good night and good luck. Who's ready to work? Yeah. We went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh, and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. That wasn't him. So what's going to happen with us when I get this job? Oh, you mean, when I get the job? Well, if you get the job, then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid, okay? I was at the beach. We don't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. You mean, Kevin? Exactly. No, but you get it, right? I can't stay there. Yeah. I do. Come on. How are you guys doing? Need anything? No. We're good. Thanks. I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is. Know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. Well, who's that? That is Beardy. Beardy? I'm going to introduce myself. No, no. That's not his real name. That's just what I call him. So I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like kid actors tagging along with Daddy on the big audition, hoping to be discovered, except Daddy is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep. Michael is gone. Hail to the chief. My first order of business, make Andrew Bernard my number two. My first order of business, accept. As if you have a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime. Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. Hey, Hunter. What's up, my brother? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire. Administrative assistant. Jan in yet? I think she's coming in later. Could you give her a message for me when she gets in? Sure. Just say I want to squeeze them. It's code. She'll know what it means. Okay. Oh, Hunter, could you tell her also? You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk, even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession. Thank you. I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated. You wouldn't understand. I want you to be assistant regional manager. Really? Well, in a sense. Although, publicly, I am going to retain the assistant regional manager position. You will be your own assistant. Correct. I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped off its pomp and frills. Okay. So you would be the regional manager and the assistant regional manager, Andy is your number two. I would be the secret assistant regional manager. Let's call it secret assistant to the regional manager. Do you accept? Absolutely I do. I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you if you accept something secret, you reply, "Absolutely I do. " Hello, hello! Michael, good to see you. Good to see you. Have a seat. Here are the post-merger performance tests that you asked for. Great. I've been meaning to thank you, by the way. You didn't lose a single customer in the merger and you still managed to trim the budget. That is nice work. So, let me ask you a question right off the bat, what do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager? Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard, I care too much, and sometimes I can be too invested in my job. Okay. And your strengths? Well, my weaknesses are actually strengths. Oh. Yes. Very good. There you go. Very good. Dwight is our new boss. No, Michael's not going anywhere. Then who do you think will get the job? Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pantsuits. I think it's going to be Michael. Do you really think he's qualified for that job? No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now and he got that one. Yeah. Listen up. Come to the center of the room, please. This is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks equals an extra five minutes for lunch. What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? Excellent question, Pam. One one-hundredth of a cent. So, 10,000 of your dollars is worth one real dollar? Just Zip your lid. Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work-related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded do-goodedness. No longer. No more meetings. Amen. Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. Do we have to? Yes. Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices and his name is me. Conference room, 10 seconds. All of you! I literally cannot wait until I see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here. What do you think we can be doing better? I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like Paper Great or Great Paper's Our Passion. We're great. I don't know. It could be good. Or Super Duper Paper. It's super duper. I don't know. Something like that. Okay. Okay. Thanks for coming in, Michael. Thank you. It is always a treat when our paths cross. It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh, before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, Jan and I are back together. So I may need to fill out one of those love documents again. You're back together. Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her. Or on top of her. That's not sexual. Just We're all professionals. Okay. Well, I thought it was clear in the description of the position. The job you're applying for is Jan's job. I don't understand. So we're going to tag-team it? No. We're letting Jan go. Listen up. Let's start from the ground up. Where does paper come from? Trees. Trees. And where do trees grow? Soil. Forests. Right. We have in front of you here seven different types of Pennsylvania topsoil. Now, what would you say is the most important element in the production of aboveground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? Wrong. It's nitrogen. Absorb this information. Good. Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley, when rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state? Liquid. Very good. You have earned one Schrute Buck. I don't want it. Then you have been deducted Make it 100. Well Don't you want to earn Schrute Bucks? No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks? The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. Okay. That's it! Class is canceled. Everybody out! No, wait, what are you doing? I'm punishing them. No, no, no, no. Class is not canceled. This is so stupid. Hey! Come on! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation. What What are you winking for? Zip your lid! So that's my basic five-year plan and then after that who knows? Okay. Now, this may seem like an odd question. Yeah? What do you think about Michael Scott? He's a very nice man. And he's very well-suited for the job he has now. This is off the record. He would be a disaster. Hey, you. Hey. How was your interview? Pretty good. Yeah? Could have gone better, I guess. Oh. Well, I will put in a good word for you. Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later. What? Let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica, live in a bungalow. You have some savings, right? You can pay off my debts. It would be fine. We'd have fun. What's What's the matter? What What happened in there? I can't tell you. Tell me what? You son of a bitch. Jan, this isn't the time. I'm in an interview You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off? Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic. Erratic? Recently you don't even show an interest in your work. You smoke constantly in your office, you spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days, always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you Is it because of these? Whoa, hey, whoa, Jan. Come on Is it No, I want to know! I want to know! Because if it is, then Then I will see you in court. It's not. It's not. No. Because he likes them, okay? He likes them. And that is That is all I care about. The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable. Hey, you're unstable. Yeah. No. We're all unstable. Okay, do you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. David, I did not tell her. It's like I'm staring into my soul when I look at this wall. It's like outer space without the stars. It's so black. This is going to look so awesome. It's so intimidating. Anyone who comes in here is going to have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope ye who enter here. Totally! Bye, Hunter. Bye. Good luck with your band. Oh, thank you Don't let them change you, okay? So long So I am going to give her a ride home. Let me know about the job. Actually, Michael, I think we're going to take it in another direction. Good. I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions. No, we're not giving you the job. You know what? That is actually good because I don't think I could take my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal? I do. Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though? Yes. Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two, either one of them, excellent candidates. Wow. That was some serious, hardcore self-destruction. Yeah. I kind of feel bad for her, though. Don't. She's nuts. Oh, man. You know what, this might take a while. You really don't have to stay if you don't want. Okay, good because a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch and I was going to meet them. So All right. Just call me when you're done. Sure. Good luck, Halpert. Thank you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure. Oh, God. I mean, I just don't understand. It's just so rude, you know. I know. I know. I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy. I am sorry about that. That was terrible. Oh, just No, actually, I think it's good. You know, it's fine, actually. I do. I really think it's great that it happened because, you know, my work has always been the thing that's gotten in the way of my happiness. So Yeah. Well, it's No, don't cry. It's going to be okay. Oh, I know. I know. It's just I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Oh, they make my moods totally unpredictable. Wow. What am I going to do? I don't know. Well, I guess you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Oh. I would probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile, but Live together. Actually, wait a minute, this could be great. This could be perfect. You know, my full-time job can be our relationship. I can wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. It could work. This could work, really. I'll be back. And I am back. How did it go? No, no, Pam. I'm back for good. Kevin Nealon. Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you, I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoo-in. Well I got down there, I nailed the interview and the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black? To intimidate my subordinates. That's stupid. It was Andy's idea. You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management. Good thing I'm back. Ryan, coffee. I don't do that stuff anymore. No. It's for me, bimbo. Kids. So I'm back and I am never, ever, going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place is like the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home and my graveyard for my bones. Did Karen get the job? Back to work. Still waiting on that coffee. Pam, hello. Dwight, hello. I wanted to thank you for helping me when you held the title of secret assistant to the regional manager. You served the office with great dignity. No, I don't know what the future holds. But I'm optimistic and I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I are just too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But, you That is a You know, not A man. A man version. But until then I can hold my head up. I'm not gay. I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan. I should leave. Now, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy. Thanks. Always hit your numbers, personable. You make a great impression on everyone you meet. I'm sorry, wait. So is the question, how did I get to be so awesome? Because I don't have an answer for you. Oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers Yes. Absolutely.  and questionnaire? Sorry to make you fill that thing out. Oh, no. Absolutely. It's just a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here. He's probably the only person you're not going to like. Kendall. So, first up. There you go. How do you think you'd function here in New York? What's that? Oh, great. You know I just I really appreciate the buildings and the people, and there's just an energy that New York has. Not to mention they have places that are open past 8:00, so that's a bonus. You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. What have you liked most about that place? The friendships. Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So, long haul, where do you see yourself in 10 years? How are your feet? Medium rare. Thanks. The real reason that I went to Stamford was because I wanted to be Not here. I know. And even though I came back, I just feel like I've never really come back. Well, I wish you would. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Just one moment. I'll transfer you. I haven't heard anything. But I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified and smart. Everyone loves him. And if he never comes back again, that's okay. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just We never got the timing right. You know, I shot him down and then he did the same to me and But you know what, it's okay. I'm totally fine. Everything is going to be totally Pam. Sorry. Are you free for dinner tonight? Yes. All right. Then it's a date. I'm sorry. What was the question? So I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty, but after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. Great. I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here. I'm excited, too. Okay. Bye. Who was that? Nobody. You and I are done. What?
Okay. Well I did not get the job in New-York. But I got the real prize domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning. Well, she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it. That's what I have to come home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours. This is going be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protégé Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Andy and Dwight are rocking the sales team. I feel very blessed. Generally it's not a good idea to click on any internet offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer? It was for a video. Yeah, well, what kind of video? A cebrity sex tape. Really? What kind of celebrity? - Not relevant. - How much you paid for it? - You paid for it? - It all happened so fast! I broke up with Karen after the job interview. And, uh It was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me very clearly that just because we were broken up doesn't mean that she was going anywhere, because she had worked really hard for her career. But the next day, her desk was empty. And as for me and my current romantic life I, uh I'm single now and looking. So if you know anybody Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his breakup. It's really nice to be good friends again. Are you kidding me? Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile. They're just keeping it a secret. Right? I don't know. There is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. Could other things. Are you kidding me? And sunday, I'm thinking of going to that flea market at the drive-in. Oh, that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on sunday in montage mountain. - Cool. - Yeah. Well, have fun with that. Ladies and gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car. - What? - Where? It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital. And the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could. And she is going to be okay. What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? - So she's really going to be fine? - Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture. But people have survived far worse. Thank God you were there. Yeah. Did you see who did it? No need. We can just check the security tapes. Yeah, kind of a good news/bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her. Who was driving? Oh, Michael. One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then. - It's only Meredith. - Yeah, it's only Meredith. Thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something. - Why did you it? - It was an accident. - Was she talking back? - No. Just got sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances? Hey, guys. We're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers. Who's we? You and Jim? No, me and Stanley and Phyllis so far. I bet Jim goes too. I haven't asked him yet. - I bet you ask. - I was planning on it. I bet you were. Angela? Are you coming? I can't. Sprinkles is sick. She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking. No one asks about Sprinkles. I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her. And who will she eat lunch with? Can't your other cats keep her company? There's bad blood. Jealousies, cliques. Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this. It's your job. All right! - My lord, my lieg. - Yes, Michael? So Ryan got promoted to corporate where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton, I'm still top dog in a fairly large pond. So whos the real boss? The dog or a fish? So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back. Back? Why is that, Michael? Well, I ran down Meredith in my car. - Did you do this on purpose? - No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. - But she will - It happened on company property? Yes. It was on company property with company property, so Double jeopardy, we are fine. I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.  Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is "we're fine"? People keep calling me a "wunderkind. " I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means. It means very successful for your age. So I guess it makes sense, but It's a weird word. - Hey, D. - Hey monkey, what's up? Can you do me a favor? Go to my place and give Sprinkles her medicine? Sure. I have to visit the alkie. Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what? I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some worker's comp. I wouldn't put it past her. - So what do you need me to do? - I wrote it out. There's a diabetes shot. Roll the insulin in your hands, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal. But put her right in front of the dish, or her cataracts won't let her see it. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine. And you wanna give that to her And there's a fungal cream, because she has this infection under her tail. So you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base. Okay, I have an announcement. You pushed Darryl out the window? - You shot Dwight? - No. No, that is not funny. I love my employees. Even though I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look, I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy and on to more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree. Oh, good. That means we don't have to work. We're leaving for the hospital at 1:00. So, like, a freedom tree. - I can take 3 people. - I can also take 3 people. - Separate cars. - Pam? We'll get a card at the hospital, and we'll sign it outside her room. Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly workers can go at lunch. Okay, good, good. So we'll just all go down there together at lunch. - Excellent. - I was thin - Good work, Pam. - But if you All right, since im the boss, I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun? You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning. Everybody inside the car was fine, Stanley! Guess what? I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes, I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally, I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me. No, don't sue me. That's the opposite of the point that I am trying to make. I hate hospitals. In my mind, they are associated with sickness. She looks like an angel. She looks awful. No okay. She always looks like that, it was not my fault. I think she's awake. She's in the coma. I brought all your friends from the office. - At the same time. - Yep. - Hello, Meredith. - This is weird. Brought you some balloons. Why don't we Here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes. Oh, for God's sake. - Nurse! - No, don't bother the nurse. Just put it back in. I am going to be sick. I'm going to puke. I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it. - Don't touch it. - What are you doing? Just gimme that. Thanks. Does it hurt terribly? No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers. Really? What kind, codeine? Vicodin? Percocet? Fentanyl? Oxycontin? - Palladone? - I have no idea. Well, it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office. Okay, wait up, wait up, guys. Guys, guys, hold on a sec. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody. I'm not gonna do that. 'Cause you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to godliness. No, that's not - You cracked my pelvis. - Look, I jus I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug. You're not forgiven. Come on. Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not, like, this compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised. Hey. hey, monkey. Any problems? Well, you left the TV on. And your cat is dead. - What?! - Sparkles, the white one, is dead. Sprinkles. That was the sick one, right? But I thought she had more time. Did she look When you saw her, how was she looking? Really dead. Like a, just a dead cat. So Hey, come on. Don't be sad. Just Okay? Just - She's in a better place. - All right. Actually, the place that she's in is the freezer. Because of the odor. It's gonna be okay. Okay, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis. A tiny, little crack. And she's gonna be fine. So let just Michael, Angela's cat died. Sprinkles? I'm sorry, Angela. Man, what a day, huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then Sprinkles! God! That's three things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed. And we need to do something about it. Well, I am taking responsibility. An it's up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not supersticious, but I'm I am a little sticious. Did anyone do anything involving an indian burial ground? - Like what? - Like park on it. Or dig up a body. Toby? Do you have anything you wanna tell us? No, I did not violate an indian burial ground. In fact, I had some good luck recently. Alfredo's pizza picked my business card out of the basket, so I get a week of free pies. - That's cool. - Yeah. Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan. Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God, in your infinite wisdom, how can you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish. It is only a cat. You never You don't like them. Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat. - Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith? - No, I have not. Well, I think you should go to the hospital and pay your respects. I do not respect her. But I will go. All right. I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs. Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs. Satan is the master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite. All right, well, then you can ask about religious beliefs. Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright, let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in. - Catholic. - Okay. - Presbyterian. - Oh, me too. - For real? - Same religion. I'm a lutheran, and bob is a unitarian. It keeps things spicy. That's why we're cursed. I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader. Kelly, you are hindu. So you believe in Buddha. That's buddhists. Are you sure? No. What are you? Well, if you're gonna reduce my identity to my religion, then I'm sikh. But I also like hip-hop and NPR. And I'm restoring a 1967 corvette in my spare time. Okay. So one sikh, and As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity used to keep Meredith alive, we could power a small fan for two days. You tell me what's unethical. Blink once if you want me to pull the plug. Don't pull any plugs. How are you doing, miss Palmer? - Better. - Excellent. Are you a doctor or a male nurse? I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor. Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy, but she did, or at least, she got time off for one. So that is where her uterus went. Your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago? Yes. Dwight here trapped it in a bag against my head. Just doing my job. You also were recently bitten by a raccoon? And a rat. Separate occasions. Spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. And it's not even one of the popular ones. Everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense. God is dead. If there was a god, then Ryan and I would be married by now. Maybe believing in god was a mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice to. Like a giant buffalo. Or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer. With the body of a porcupine. I will do some research. - Okay. - I can help you with that. So just to be safe, they are giving her the rabies vaccine. God, rabies? I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that? Is that like an STD? - No. You gotta be bitten by something. - This place is so cursed. Actually, the doctor said she was lucky, 'cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in. Lockjaw. I know a lot of you are very upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her with my car. But it may make you feel a little bit better to know that before that happened Dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head and it had a bat in it. Six of one, really. Turns out, Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is, like, ten times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me, she went to the hospital, and that saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken, people! Oh, there is a god! And he has a plan for us after all. So go home, get some rest. Very, very good work today. Got a lot accomplished. Is there a god? If not, what are all these churches for? And who is Jesus' dad? Oh, well. If they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together. Like PB & J. Pam Beesly and Jim. What a waste. What a waste. I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like, when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it to is a camera crew or my coworkers. Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever wanna be. Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know. Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure, this is Pam. Pro-am. Pro-am race for the They hung up. A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has been largely eradicated in the U.S. But not very many people know that. No, rabies. Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime? Hi, Stankley, how many sponsors so far? Zero. Come on, man. You gotta step it up. It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500. Isn't that your money? That is for a good cause. - Phyllis, how the rabies quilt coming? - Oh, it's coming. Oh, look at that! Three. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis. You can't make me run. It is not a real charity. It's stupid, Michael and I'm not gonna do it. You didn't run for me when I thought I had skin cancer. I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts. Well, back in olden times, a large, fat person like this was a person of power. A person who had money, who could buy food. A person of respect, like the regional manager of the day. Whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was somebody who worked in the fields, and I was a peasant. I just don't wanna run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes. You're gonna have to run or you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore. I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts, is a vicious circle. You have sensitive nipples, they chafe. So they become more sensitive. So they chafe more. So I take precautions. Hey, Angela. I'm sorry about your cat. This is Sprinkles. She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year. Just a couple of kittens. Out on the town. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you could give me some advice. What's wrong? I have this crazy thought that I know is crazy that maybe Dwight killed my cat. When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her. But all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds! Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy. Angela, I'm sorry. Did Roy ever killed one of your cats? I'm more of a dog person. So what's your strategy for this race? I'm gonna start fast. Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle. Then I'm gonna end fast. - Why won't more people do that? - 'Cause they're stupid. What? Oh, um, no, that's not - I mean, that wasn't - Yeah, that was, um I mean, I can see how it would seem a bit like we, uh How it looks like, um But nowadays, you can edit anything, right? I mean, you can edit anything to Look like, um, anything. - So - Yeah, I gave him a ride home - because - Right. We're dating. There it is. Uh, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. Right? It is going really great. Shut up! You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger. Oh, really? You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression. I am not depressed. I'm in grief! We have raised almost $700, most of it from me and Jan. When do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later? Well, a giant check costs about $200 to make up. I have a print shop standing by, but What do you think, Michael? That's over 25% of our funds. It's a tough decision. I always imagined it with a giant check. Yeah, I mean, I personally am definitely on board for the giant check. Giant check it is. I don't know. On the other hand, it does leave less money for bat birth control. Bat birth control. This money's going to bat birth control, right? That's what you told me. You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. - How's that going? - Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700. Or $500 if we go with the giant check. - Which we are. - And also There is no such thing as a rabies doctor. How about a rabies nurse? - I don't think so. - You know what? I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour. For parties and bachelor events. That's possible. look into that. Great, it's gonna cost 200 bucks. And actually, more with tips. Maybe we should skip the ceremony and just set up a college fund for Meredith's son. Have you met that kid? I'm not going to college. not 5,000 miles. Come in. - My god! - What're you doing?! - You said, "come in!" - No, I didn't. Just - Oh, my god. - Please, get out. So I closed the door but the image of his - Baguette. - dangling participle still burned in my eyes. I can imagine. Come in. May I enter the room? Yes. Or "come in. " See how I did that? That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and wait for the all clear. You couldn't undress in the men's room? Yes. But I have an office, so why would I do that? On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? - Just ballpark. - European offices are always naked. - They're so not. - Besides, my shirt covered most of it. I only saw where it ended. - Gross. - That's not gross! It's the human body. What is your problem? Pam, you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. Okay, you know what? I don't want this to detract from what we really need to think about today. It's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? Okay. Let's go have some fun all right. They say if you're nervous around someone, you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on. Or a funny coat. I'm sorry, is this a working office? And not a french beach? Okay, name, please? Creed Bratton, 75+ division. - You're over 75 years old? - 82 november 1st. - How much is the prize money? - There's no prize money. Well, is any of this real? Check that out. Look at me, I'm Toby! I'm stretching. I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here? So I heard that you were peeping on Michael. What? No, it was not I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, okay? So hands off. Okay, everybody, listen up! Thank you for coming. Before we get started, I want to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Meth: three americans every year die from rabies. Fact: four americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming, barking killer. And it is something that Darryl! - What're you doing? - I give him a peanut. No, don't give him Just Did you hear anything I said? - Look how happy he is. - He's happy because he's insane. That's a perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? - This is the reason we're here. - Hello, Michael. Oh, hey, I know you. - Elizabeth, right? - Yeah. Very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check for $340 made out to Science. Make sure that that gets into the right hands. You got it? Okay. Fettuccini Alfredo. Time to carbo load. Just remember, folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing. On your marks! Get set! On your left! You're doing great, Michael. Look at you go! That's my boss! - Yeah, baby! - I'm fast. I'm very fast. I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. Oh, yes, I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause. I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. The key is drafting to eliminate wind resistance. Yeah. Oh, we're in last place. - Oh, would you look at that? - Darn it. Water! Water. - Water, babe? - No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water. Solidarity! Michael, that's irrational! Rabies victims have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So least I could do. Oh, god. My nipples! It's starting. - Can we get another round? - Okay. Thanks. So we've got what? Another 20 minutes? More or less. That fettuccini is hitting my stomach like a rock. You got nothing to worry about. I put imodium in Toby's coffee before the race. Excellent! Simpsons! Wait, imodium or ex-lax? I'm making great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break halfway through a race like this, but not today. Ooh, an estate sale. Want to go in? I'm really committed to winning. Okay, but what if I told you that all the money you spend here goes to preventing a disease already cured. - Yes. - That's what I thought. - Yeah. - Right? Let's do some good. You have reached the offices of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  Currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael scott D.M.S.M.P.M.C. Rabies awarness pro-am fun run race  For the cure.  Leave a message.  Oh, god. Oh, Alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. God! Watch the nipples, Kevin! Back off me. You're feeling better? No. Well, you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat. The vet's removing Sprinkles' organs right now and sending them to the lab. - I am a farmer, Angela. - What does that mean? When a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do. You did kill her! I sang her her favorite songs. You put her in my freezer! It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep. She barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out. I'm not responsible for that - It's nothing! - I'm robbing her! - It's nothing! - It's nothing! It's fine! How could you do that without telling me? I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat the best way I knew how. Cat heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized. I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuff. Well, he's not great, but he's pretty good. You don't understand. Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit. Or we can have her buried out at the east field by mother. - Huh, Angela? - Don't touch me, Dwight. You like it? It's kind of designy and cool. It was $8. Oh, and I get to carry it. And the winner is Toby Flenderson! Have a seat. I'll write it down. Where are we? I don't know. Like five kilometers from the office. He couldn't have made it circle? I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies. Rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. - Pictures of the dog all around. - Yeah, probably What are you doing here? Did you come back for us or I can't finish. I feel so weak. I just - You're probably dehydrated. - What do you want me to do, Jim? A glass of water would be a start. There are people all over the world with all sorts of problems and afflictions and diseases. They're deformed and they're abnormal, and they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it. I can't, you know There's just one of me, and there's thousand of them. And rabies wins. You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day. I'm still having a nice day. - You are? - Yeah. Hey, Michael, look at this lamp. $8. That's a good deal. And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not gonna get it anytime soon. So you don't really have to think about it too much. Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done. Yeah, but there's other better people out there who are helping. You just don't think I am capable of making a difference. I know you, Michael. I saw you naked. You don't You don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference. Remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this G.D. 5k. Finishing that 5k was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more Fettuccine Alfredo and drank less water than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit. Today, I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart. And while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that. Hey, Michael. Hey, Mer. - How you doing? - Better. It's ironic, isn't it? I mean, I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water. And you're in it for a disease that causes a fear of water. I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I want to say I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore. Thanks. I'm not mad at you anymore. Want to share? Sure. I'm not really sick. I'm good.
- Hey, I got you one. - Hey. Thank you. I was gonna grab some chips, you want some? No, thanks. We're still having lunch today, right? I guess. How dare you? Hey, Toby? What's this? I just wanna remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA, - or public displays of affection. - Yes Some people in the office have complained. - Oh, really. - About other people engaging in PDA. And you know, just wanted to remind them it's not appropriate to do that. Is this about me and Jan in my office? Because I'll have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think anyone heard anything. We're very discreet. And most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do, is roll up the memo real tight Okay, look, the memo was not out you. For the record, I've never been involved with anyone at work in any capacity. All right, everyone, look. All right, the complaint was about Jim and Pam - No way. - What? You guys are together? Yep. Yes, we are. - Tuna! - Awesome! I knew it! To the two of you. Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us? - Yes. - Okay. Mind is exploding. Get over here. Come on. Come here. Okay, stand up. Here we go. Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today is the day that Jim and Pam - become one. - Actually, we're dating for 2 months. I love you guys so much. - Phone's ringing. - No, no. Pam, let'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder-Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is really good. This is really good. My heart soars with the eagle's nest. I don't see it. I think they both could do better. It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress. Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?

Blowing up balloons, I thought. You might wanna trim it a little? - Michael. - Oh, is Ryan coming back today? Yeah, he is. Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream. What do you want? To give you this. - What is that? - It's a ferel barn cat. I trapped him and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed. Her name was Sprinkles. And his name is Garbage. Most calls him Garbage 'cause he likes to eat garbage. Don't you, Garbage? I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles, before she's even in the ground. You haven't buried her yet? Don't rush me. I'm grieving. Garbage can be very helpful, okay? He's a useful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. Look at him. I don't want Garbage. I want Sprinkles! Hey Toby. Hey, Pa - You two. - Hey. So now that we are dating, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those "we're dating" things for the company. Oh, well, you know, those are only for, you know, relationships. So if it's just a casual thing, there's no need, really. Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but it's, like, pretty official. Sorry, so do we need to sign one, or Let's just wait and see what happens, you know. - What? - Well, let's just wait. - Oh, okay. - Okay. Great. - Hey, Ryan. - Hold on one sec. Hey, Pam. It's great to see you. Is Michael in? - Hey, there he is! - Yeah. He's back! And he's with a beard. He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, M. Sonny Crocket. I'm Tubbs. Okay. Should we get started? Yeah, let's get started because, uh, yes. - 'Cause this is very serious business. - Yeah, exactly. This is a business meeting. - Fire guy! - Stop that! That's right! Fire guy! Don't start any fires, Ryan. Fire guy! - You weren't here for that. - Here for what? - When he started the fire. - Look how big he is. Look at you! You are so mature and old and little man now. - You're like our little man. - Little old man boy. - Michael, everybody - Bearded like man boy. Let me say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I'm your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me the same way you treated Jan. - So - That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way. - I think Ryan has a gay crush on me. - Enough, okay! This is inappropriate and it stops right now. - Do you understand? - Yes. Everybody, come on. Settle down. Let's get serious here. Ryan has a very special important presentation to do which we will be doing in the conference room in ten minutes. - Perfect. - Sound good? Okay. All right. Yeah, Ryan snapped at me. Bu there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on which said, "Dude, we're friends. "I'm doing this for appearances. "I'm the big boss now. "And I have to seem like an ogre. "But you know me "and you trust me, "and we like each other. "And we'll always be friends. "And I would never take you for granted "in a million years. "And I miss you, man. "And I love you." His words. Dunder-Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business to business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains. Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder-Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger, sleeker and more agile with the way that we adapt to the marketplace. Essential personal will be issued blackberries for company use. Gimme, gimme. I'll stick around for a while to help you set them up. Any questions? What if we don't wanna use a blackberry because they are stupid and pointless? - This's company-wide, Dwight. - Got it. You should call it Dunder-Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together. Any other questions? Can we speak privately about our relationship? Thank you, everybody! Ryan Howard everybody! Good job! That was some fun stuff. When's the website go up? As fast as possible. We wanna start re-training people ASAP, to hit the ground running with the new system. Cool beans. - We're screwed. - Who is? Us, you and me. The old timers. I am not old. You are old. You are, like, a 100. You're over 40. That's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system, youth. I'm telling you, this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this, or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners. I swore I wouldn't tell anybody this, but in the interest of revealing secrets Oh, my god, this is gonna make your brain explode. Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months. Swear to god. This is great. I was gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun. No, they have been dating for, like, two years. Since before your barbeque. Wait, what? You knew. And you didn't say anything? You didn't say anything to me. Fair enough. We should have started dating, like, a long time ago. Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here. - No, we're just sitting here. - I couldn't see your hands. Oh, hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Okay. And that is why we waited so long to tell people. - Okay, what's up? - Yeah, okay. Um, I was just After the presentation, wanted to make sure that vis-a-vis me in the office, everything is business as usual. Well, it's business but not as usual. Yeah, no, I understand. We're making great strides and you're updating. - But business as usual, no? - No. We threw out the playbook, we start from scratch. We're implementing a brand new system. - Good, so we're on the same page. - No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and manpower are waisted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself. We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's what I thought he was. Um, and then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I just spent the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like: a fake brother who steals your jeans. So - How are you? - Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys. - Good. - A lot. Black guys, mostly. What? Wait How do you touch just one of these buttons at a time? I don't know. Did you even try? If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him. I can't see half the things. It's too little. Use the phone. I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want. Kelly, I'm your boss now, okay? Stop talking to me like I'm your boyfriend. Oh, big strong man. Fancy new whatever. - You never cared about me. - I never cared about you? Six months ago, Karen Filippelli sent me an email asking me out. I said no because I was committed to our relationship. Well, I hope you're still committed, because I'm pregnant. And guess what buddy? I am keeping it. - You feel prepared to raise a baby? - I ca I can't talk about this right now, okay? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, okay? We have a date! - Hello. - Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight. Really? Yes. I'll make a reservation. No, no, let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side. I would prefer a public place. See you after work. - Hi, Pam. - Hi. - Is Michael in? - In his office. Go right in. So, elephant in the room, I have your old job. Well, not exactly my job. - A different title. - Oh, well, excuse me. Same office. Same responsibilities. Different salary. You'll get there. Don't worry. - You look great. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Scranton seats you. Best decision I ever made. You were let go. You know what? Love the beard, keep it forever. What is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles? What? I don't wanna grow weird sperm in case we ever wanna have kids. So what's Ryan doing here? I don't know. They're launching a big new business plan, a new website. He's being a real twerp about it though. It's all about youth, and agily, and streamlining. - Try to squeeze out the older people. - He's such a snake. Hope he gets them an ageism suit. What is that word? Ageism? The companies, they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Two years ago, we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit. So, we had to back off. So older people have just as many rises as younger people. Yes, Michael. They do. - Creed? - Yes, sir? - Everything okay? - Everything's cool, dude. I'm 30. Well, in november, I'll be 30. Another meeting's scheduled? I was gonna do the blackberry tutorial, in here. Michael told us to wait in here, we don't know why. Oh, man. Good, we're all here. - We can get started. - Michael. Have a seat. Have a seat like everybody else. Okay, this is for everyone's Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well new ideas are fine. But they are also illegal. Because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the age discrimination and employment act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees I did. Technically, he's right. Hey, shut up, Toby. Why do we as a society hate old people so much? - Because they're lame. - No! Creed, no, they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like, "Where's the beef?" - Yeah. - Why the big picture's up again? You used that when you burned your foot. We were using the Ben Kingsley too. I was going to put up some new pictures, but, all of the ink in the printer was gone. - Michael Scott? - That is me! Come on in. Whis this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street, out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder-Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Oh, yeah! Yes! - Michael, can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure thing. Excuse me. - We've actual work to do. - Fine. Then I'll call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. Bob, how old are you? - I'm 87. - 87 years young. And still tive. That is great. Did you know that Bob is still a member of the board of Dunder-Mifflin? Well, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I send a proxy. Still sends his own proxy. Good for you. I'm going to live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Mannheim is 103, and still puttering around down in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah foundation. I started this company in 1949. Back then, it was an industrial supplier of metal brackets, mostly for construction. Oh, boy. And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later, but I knew Mifflin through the rotary club. Great. He was He was at dinner with Beverly and her husband. What was his name? Uh,`jerry. Jerry Trupiano from South Jersey. And he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys. Great. That's great. Thank you for coming in. Robert Dunder, everybody. Thank you. That was wonderful. - Do you have a ride? - Well, I came here in a cab. - Perfect. - Well, could you give me another Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Because it's illegal and you will go to jail. I should help him get home. No, no, don't help him! He doesn't need help, Pam. What a nice guy. Good night, guys. Well, today was a fantastic waste of time. I disagree. It think it was very valuable. Michael, technology helps business, okay? You shouldn't resist it. This is the way the world is moving. I happen to think that old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it. - Okay. - I look forward to hearing your ideas. - Where do you wanna go? - Some place romantic and expensive. Kelly, come on. You know what? You're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous, anyway. So we can just skip it. Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles? Very much. How is your meat? Dry, delicious. - I heard a joke today. - Oh, that's funny. Yes, it was. Are you enjoying your mineral water? - I can't do this. - What? I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes, I see Sprinkles' stiff, lifeless body. Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here. It's an old sales trick. I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could. No, please don't do this, monkey. I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. Smell that. You smell that? - Dry rot. - No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I've done here, is I have collected the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer. - Sweet, chocolate turtles. - Yes. Nope! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our ex-clients. I'll explain later. Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and I.M.S. But I think he is forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attached to baskets of food. Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these receipts for these gift basket items. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Is that all? - Yes. I miss you. Elevators. Dwight, you have to listen to me. We are not seeing each other anymore. Can you accept that? Fine. Then I just wanna be friends. Good. Plus a little extra. Also, I love you. I don't understand what the big deal is. - You lied about being pregnant. - Right, so? You really don't understand why that makes me angry? - No. - We're never getting back together. Why not? All right, I just have to ask. Now that we're public is the magic gone? It's funny you bring that up, because yes, it is. I knew it. Oh, man. - Just like that, huh? - I think I mean, I don't-- I don't know what it is, but - Be honest. - I now find you repulsive. That's honest. All right, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted, though, wasn't it? Yeah. For me it was. Okay. All right. Hey, boss. I didn't know you were coming in today. What's, uh, going on here? I am glad that you asked. Listen up, everybody! In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, - and we are going to win them back. - With gift baskets. With peanut brittle. With macadamia nut cookies. With chocolate turtles. With raspberry jam. And a little bit of fat and salt. Because you know what? That's what people like. Ever since I was a kid, people have been telling me that I can't do things. "You can't be on the team." "You can't move on to second grade." Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually hated second grade. And I was the biggest kid in class. Okay, we're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis; Stanley, Dwight; me, Andy. I'm not driving with him. - I'll go with you, Stanley. - Or him. - Why don't we just go by ourselves? - Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmenship. This is stupid. What-- okay. That's not helpful, Phyllis. How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back? Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can receive. What about cash? Cash can buy whatever you want, including a gift basket, so it's kind of the best gift ever. - What about a gift basket full of cash? - Yes! Cash basket! Nice work, Tuna. Fine, I'm just gonna go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself. Because this is important to me. Michael, wait. Let me go. No, this is my quest. Please let me go. I need to win those clients back. - Please. - Fine. Then god speed. To both of us. Good luck, Michael. We don't need luck. Yeah. But thank you, that was really nice of you to say. Business to business. The old fashioned way. No blackberries, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people. Yes, I understand that, David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly, and then outsource customer service to India, which a lot of companies Yes, no-- Yes, Kelly is indian. I understand that's confusing. Hey, brah. Been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull. Am I right? Later, skater. Sweet ride. American made. What happened to the sebring? It is in the body shop. I had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith. - That's a pain in the ass. - I know. - So who's next? - Larry Meyers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot. Proceed to the highlighted route then route guidance will begin. Why do you use that thing? It lets them know where you are at all times. Who? The government, spy satellites, private detectives. Ex-girlfriends. Next night, I'm out at a bar, 2:00 AM. I figure I'll get a sandwich. 'Cause you can get a sandwich any time of the night. I run into Vince Vaughn. - No way. - Literally. Dude, you are so money. But you dot even know it. But you do. - Later, guys. - Yeah - Later, dude. - Later, man. How awesome is Ryan now? Yeah, he's definitely something. - What does that mean? - That whole lifestyle his whole vibe? You find that appealing? Tuna! He has a killer job. He's rich. He smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like. He wears really cool rich guy cloth. And he can get any girl that he wants. So, sorry, Tuna, but if you don't know why that awesome, then you need awesome lessons. Tuna, check ya later. 'Cause he's so money that he doesn't even know it. Those things are heavy. There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps? You know we closed our account, right? - Yes, we do. - We're with Office Depot now. - Yes. - Yes, we know. - But we just have not gotten over you. - Well And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service. - This is true. - The best personal business relation We can if you ever decide to come back to us. Okay. I don't think we're coming back. - Please come back. - Okay, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch. Remember what we had, Larry? I mean, really, it's about money. Well, just enjoy the gift basket. - Okay, than. - All right. I mean, their website's really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us. That guy was so st How can't they know how much better we are? I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and make you miserable. That is true. Like Angela in accounting. Yes, she is nuts. No, she's wonderful. At accounting. But she drives me crazy. Make the next right turn. How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive. Hey, Pam. I haven't settled on a final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity. And I know you're into graphic design. You wanna give it a shot? - Maybe try and design the logo? - Uh, totally. Cool. That would be great. Can you do a couple mock-ups and I'll take a look? - Yeah. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Cool. - Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock-ups and then turn those into thumbnails. Maybe do some, uh, splash frames. I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm excited. And the last guy says, no, Harry Body. You know I have heard it before. Well, it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke. Your daugther Emily. How's she doing? She's great. Thanks for asking. Great memory, by the way. She gonna be, like, 11 this winter? They grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want someday. I don't wanna take any more of your time, you're a busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies. And to ask you to reconsider. Oh, okay. Okay? Okay! So you'll reconsider? Okay, thanks for the goodies. Is that all you have to say? It looks delicious? I don't know. You don't know? Look We want you back. Can you offer lower prices? - Well, no. - Then we're not coming back. - He's not coming back. It's over. - No, it's not. - No, he's right. - Accept it, why would he come back? Why would he come back? I'll tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products, and you're not getting the same customer service that you get with us, are you? That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it. Look We're also coming out with a website soon. It's a staf-the-art thing. It'll be up and running. It's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much easier. Well, okay. Well, when it's up, i'll check it out and if it really cuts costs, maybe we'll come back. Great. The magic of the gift basket. That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up. Okay. Good. Don't let Emily have any of the almonds. She's allergic. Proceed straight. Well, we're 0 for 6. Last chance is the Elmhurst Country Club. Other side of the lake on the southeast side. I don't get it. I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I threw everything I had at that guy, nothing. That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything, and everything falls apart. And eventually you die and no one remembers you. That is a very good point. Make a right turn. Wait, wait! No, no. It means bear right. - Right there. - No, it said right. It said, take a right. No, no, look. It means go up to the right, bear right over the bridge and hook up with 307. Maybe it's a short cut. It said, go to the right. It can't mean that. - It's a lake there! - It knows where it's going! - This is the lake! - The machine knows. Stop yelling at me! No, it's up there! There's no road here! Remain calm. I have trained for this. Okay. Exit the window! - Here we go. - Make a U-turn. If possible. Look out for nature! Michael! Are you okay? Swim for it! I got you! I got you! Michael! Let go. Let go off me! I've got you! I've got you! Come on! Come on! You sure you're okay? Fine. Good. That is what's most important. Did you get the rental insurance? 'Cause that is pretty important too at a time like this. What a disaster. This whole thing. I'll call a cab. These people just don't realize what a gift basket means. They don't get it. Look, still works. Old fashioned cell phone. Yeah. What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk I don't even know if I want it. Their website, so easy. Yeah, well, you can have your technology, jackass. - Look where it got us. - Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton. At the end of East Mountain Road. - In the lake. - Hang up. You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office. And we are going to re-claim our gift basket! We're going to take what's rightfully ours. We're gonna take a stand, Dwight. - We're gonna take a stand! - Take a stand! So plays on the infinity thing without being obvious Yeah, definitely. I'd love to do, like, a color version. Just bring a little color I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good. You've a real talent for this. - Thanks. - I'd love to talk to you about it more. - That'd be great. - Do you wanna go out to dinner tonight? - Oh, is it - Wear something nice. - No. - What? - I just wanted to have dinner. - I'm sorry. I'm dating Jim. You're kidding. We're together. That's great. That's awesome. Yeah, great. - So let me - Yeah. - Let me look at these. - Okay, great. Great. I guess he can't get any girl he wants. Do you forget something? What happened to you guys? Give it back. The gift basket. Give it back. - What is this? - It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket. Maybe you should leave. Yeah, maybe we should. Maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave. But before we leave, my wet friend and I are gonna wait for our cabs on your nice couches! Can you call us a cab, please? I'm gonna-- Oh, sorry! - Look. - My clothes are so wet. Nice leather. My shoes are so muddy! All right, here you go. Take it back! - It's open. - Yeah, it was mine. What's missing? The turtles. Where are the turtles? Come on. Get out of here! Where are the turtles?! - Where are they? - I've an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with pecans. And we will not be leaving the premise until we obtain them. Hand over the turtles now! I ate them, okay? I ate the turtles. They're gone! We'll bill you. May I have your attention, please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now. That is not correct. Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well, guess what? I just drove my car into a lake. - You did what? - I drove my car into a fing lake. Why, you may ask, did do this? Well because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it. I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology. - And look where it got me. - Into a lake. Exactly. Did you get any clients back? Maybe. Maybe not. Time will tell. But I will tell you one thing, those gift baskets never endanger anybody's lives. Game, set, match. Point. Scott. Game over. End of game. Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me, the choice is easy.
And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They're unreadable. They're just numbers, and boring, and black. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic. Like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud. And, when we have a good quarter fireworks. Or a race car. Doesn't have to be a race car. Use your imagination. There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day. And sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits the wall and bounces away. We are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay I believe she thinks she saw it. I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing. Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that? I saw it! We have a lot of colored paper here. Why, oh, why, do we keep printing this on white? No! Come on! Yeah. I know. I know. It's bland. - It's never gonna happen. - Dude, you've gotta believe. Maybe we could have some sort of riddle - Wait for it. - Like something that you have to look for Sort of a Where's Waldo? All r- All right. Let's quit while we're ahead. - That was so awesome. - That was awesome. Thank you. Some days, I am just on fire. What can I say? Episode 4x03 "LAUNCH PARTY" Hey, there he is. Hey, Meredith. How you feeling? I never thanked you for coming. Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well, we all came, so Well, I real appreciate you coming. I'm singling you out. Anyway, I have this sharpie. And I was wondering if you could sign my cast. - Can you write where I can read it? - Yep. I'll read this when I get home. All right. Michael, this is the press release I told you about. Ryan wants you to share it. Oh, does he? He does. Okay. Attention, earthlings. I have some news. Today's the big day that I'm heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anybody has an interesting anecdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you. Was that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us? And "Today the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website officially launches. " Well, the website is the brainchild of my brainchild, Ryan. It is my brain grandchild. And, to celebrate its birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties which will be connected via web cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at a very exclusive nightclub. And that is where all of the VIPs, including yours truly, will be partying with new york city's finest. And I do not mean policemen. "The company is projecting record high sales "and that by 6:00, the website will be the new best salesman in the company. " Watch out, Dwight. That's ridiculous. I'm not gonna be beaten by a website. - Actually, it sounds like you are. - Really? 'Cause Ryan says so? That's from Ryan? Does it mention if he's seeing anybody? No. I'll find out tonight. Yes, please let us know. I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today. - Waste of time. - What's tha pipsqueak? Waste of time. The website's going to win. - You believe a computer can beat me? - I don't care, but yes. - I'll prove you wrong. - I don't care, and you won't. - You'll see. - I won't be watching, and I won't. Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who were both already prone to unpleasantness. Stanley, you're dancing. No, I'm not. Yeah, I created a website. Look. At the end of the day, Apple's apple is flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company. And I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest. I told you I don't want you doing these things. You can use your own office or do it in the hall. Convergence, viral marketing. We're going guerilla. We take it to the streets while keeping an eye on the stree, Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buying paper just became fun. And this is where I will record your sales. Very nice. And then will say something positive like "kudos" or "job well done. " Or zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah. - I can't tell if he's mocking me. - Just ignore him. Can't do that. It's really hard for me to let things go. I was. Mocking. Thank you. I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale. - Yes, like a chime or a bell. - Or a gong. Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside, you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me. Yes! Isn't 7:00 P.M. a little late for a lunch party? Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party. What is wrong with you? Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I googled "how to deal with difficult people," and I got all of this. So we're gonna try out some new things today. How do you feel about the fact that the banner says "lunch"? I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid. I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be awful. It is awful. You've made this day awful. Maybe you could just change the "u" into an "a". Then it would say "lanch" party, Kevin. Would it be better if it said "lanch" party? - Lunch party. - It's supposed to say "launch. " Easy, booster seat. Nobody cares about this party anyway. I care! Plan a party, Angela. Oh, and the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65 for your budget. And here are 4 idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh, and your cat's still dead. - 20 seconds to go time. - Got it. Carb up. Really? Power gel? Hey, you wanna win, you gotta fuel like a winner. Okay. We start as soon as I make this shot. What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working? What? - He goes through a breakup. - I'm aware of that. But he's also being super-annoying, and I'm not a perfect person. - You got one! - Three reams! In your face, machines! What kinda prank are you thinking? What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure, I'll hold. Who am I? You tell me. Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I'm programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper. How do I know this isn't Jim? What is a Jim? It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please! The computer should be scared of me. I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last february that corporate gave me two plaques in lieu of a pay raise. Yes, it's too tight. Way too tight. - Really? - This is why I'm here? Why is it so tight? It's a european cut. It just looks bad. What's hanging? - Setting up the web cam for the party. - Oh, good. Okay, cool. How many pounds I could lose by 7:00? Depends how much you've eaten already today. I had Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Just one second, we're in a meeting. I'll see if he's available. It's Jan. Why don't you wanna go tonight? What- All your friends will be there. My friends? Michael, I was terminated. Just. - Is it that important to you? - Yeah! - All right. - Thank you. Go by yourself. No- No. No. If I go by myself, everybody'll think I'm a big loser. - Well - I've your permission to invite Carol? - What? Jesus, Michael! - I'm sor- I'm sorry. It's just the first girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with. Nice! Website check, please. You, my friend, are winning handsomely. Oh, it just made another sale- You, my friend, are in a very close second. - 402. - Okay, why don't you just lay off? What you want me to do, not announce it? So, this is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now, like twins. - Sure, we'll go. - All right. Fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy, but boys' night out is also good. Oh, I'm sorry. What? - One of the tickets is for him. - Just let me know who the winner is. - Not it. I won. - Not it. Nope. Definitely not. If anything, it was a tie. Tie goes to the girlfriend. No, I realize you normally reorder in november, but what I'm suggesting- You did what? Oh! No! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damn it! Why reorder from a computer when you could have the personal touch of a salesman? - How's it going? - Fine. Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You look a little worried. - I do not look worried. You do look worried. "Here's a suggestion, computer. "I assume you read binary. "So why don't you 011-11-011-011?" Um, while you were typing that, I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything And mastered the violin. Oh, and sold more paper. I asked for assort cutlery, and I got back spoons. These are worthless. I want to understand what you're saying, but it's difficult for me when you use that tone. Phyllis, these are spoons. Spoons have round tops and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks which have prongs or tiny spears on top. And we need knives which have blades. Do you understand me now? Yes. Goody. - Hey. - What's up? - What's going on? - Paper delivery. - Oh, yeah? - Kelly ordered this online. What are you doing? I'm in the fight of my life against this computer, and every sale counts. But when you put paper in the shopping cart, it says, "Thanks for shopping with Dunder Mifflin. " Damn it, Kelly, it knows! It knows what you did! - Who knows? - Return it. Return it now. Hey How about instead of yelling at our sweet Miss Kapoor over 500 sheets of paper, you get back to your desk and start selling multiple reams, like a man. You don't understand. Okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible. Who's "it"? - Here you go. - Thanks. You still missing Ryan? Not so much anymore. I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me, but I never intended to use them. What did intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them. Yes, Mr. Galliatto, how would you like to pay 10% less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. - Good. - All right. I'm ready to go, and I'm calling shotgun. - I'm driving? - Yes, thank you. Let me just say good-bye to Pam. Oh, yeah, you better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Good-Bye. I love you. I love you- Okay. I'm leaving inside Jim's car I don't know when I'll be back again Yes, I do Tomorrow I'll be back I'll be back tomorrow So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight? Because there's a party. A party for the web site I've been planning for two weeks. If you are not this tall, you may not ride the roller coaster. - See you tomorrow. - Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples. I'm sorry, so sorry. Yes, could you repeat that? Yes! Ten reams for the U.S. district court! Did I mention the 40 reams for the battered women's shelter? No! Stop it! Give me that! Give it! - Did you see the board? - There's still an hour. You ever read this? Yep. A long time ago, but I liked it. I got it for Ryan. I wanted to get him "Oh, the places you'll go," but they were sold out. It's the same sort of stuff in here. It's not, but it's a good book. What was that? Leaving Pennsylvania. Two kisses. - One for me, one for Jan. - Gotcha. You should come for dinner. You and Pam, that'd be fun. - That would be fun. - Wanna come over friday? - I can't. - After work, you guys- Oh, no, because- Let me know when we're close. Yes. Actually, I will tell you right now. It's a club called chat room, and there's a password to get in. Which is actually "password," so Okay. What are you doing? That is an invitation to an online party. No. I'm sure that's not- Are there three "Ws" at the beginning of the address? - Yes. - Yep. Well, the invitation says "VIPs only. " Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me that I have to drive back to Scranton to the satellite party, I am going to throw up. Okay, I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan. You know that is is like? I will tell you. This is like when the freshmen would throw a party, and wouldn't let any of the seniors go. Doesn't it piss you off sometimes that little twerp got the promotion over us? Oh, actually I withdrew from consideration. Yeah, I withdrew too. Four, three, two, one! Yes! After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in its path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping 52 - reams! - Reams! Say it again- Announcing it. - 52 reams! - No, no, the first part. Dwight has defeated the computer! Hey. So What do you think? I did it for you. I didn't ask you to do it for me. You didn't have to. How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary? - Hello, Pam. - Hello. Hey, do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man. I'll get back to you. Let me know. You beat me. You are the superior being. All right, who wants to party? - Why aren't you in New York? - Oh-ho, what?! Oh, I think I faked Oscar out. You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early. I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving, and that he could go home early? Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Well, who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton. Thank you. No, no. It's gonna be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good. And everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight? - He beat the computer. - Oh, hey, good for you. Good for you. Scranton power! You know what? Angela, I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with, and to write on. Good. It was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face. To realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive Who I'd cared about. But you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home. - How we doing on time? - The party starts in an hour. Good, these are some things that I would like to have happen. "Beer, light beer, streamers, orchids, better lighting, something made of ice. " It's just things. This is how I want it to feel. "Pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pi- " I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important- "Chocolates, someone famous, cool music, confetti, go-go dancers"? I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web cam and say, "How did they get Al Roker to come?" - I can't do this. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't 100% believe it. Who else could do this? - Okay. Okay. - No, seriously. Anyone else could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza. What do you think of Angela? I think she's efficient. No, not like that. As a woman. W- O-M-A-N I hadn't noticed. You hadn't noticed she's a woman? I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right? I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with. - Isn't that part of the fun? - No. I think you should date Kelly. She works here too. How is that any different? She works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby. Okay. - Good news. - We get to go home? Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo? Wait Alfredo's pizza cafe Or pizza by Alfredo? - Same thing. - No. I don't understand when you all talk at the same time! Oscar, talk to him. Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients and in overall taste. Which one did you order from? Pizza by Alfredo. All right, you know what? Okay, okay. What is better, a medium amount of good pizza, or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? A medium amount of good pizza. Oh, no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage. You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this. It should take you no time if you put the care into it that you normally do. That seemed to shut her up. You looking for dinner and a movie? You're not gonna find it in that box. It just so happens I know where you can find it, but again Not in the box. Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying? What? Hello. I worked on a party for 3 weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've to organize a whole new party. And my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the ice made thing. And my upper back itched all day, and I can't reach it. And Kevin had greek food for lunch again. They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates. - Yep. - The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here. - You don't have to say it like that. - I said it normal. - Hey. - Hey. Uh, $63.50, and that's not including tip. Right, I've a coupon, so half of $63.50, and half the tip on $63.50 Half-off coupons only apply to orders of two pizzas. No, I told them on phone I was ordering eight pizzas. I don't care what you told them on the phone. That's our policy. You didn't think that I was gonna spend 60 bucks on pizza? It's not pizza. It doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's your policy, it should say it on the coupon. What do you mean? - Not my problem. - It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half off, end of story. Great story. - $63.50, and that's not including tip. - I'm not giving that to you. Then, you're not getting your pizzas. No, no, you're not- You are not going anywhere. You're going to stay here until we figure this out. - What? - You know what? This young man needs to learn that that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow-through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now. - I'm not going in there. - Yeah, you are. And you'll come out when you decide to give me a discount. Please. Thank you. This is stupid. No, you don't even know what stupid is! It's about to get all stupid up in here! You find anything? We think it's a straight forward kidnapping. Stanley, could you look up "accomplices?" Why can't you guys do it? Because we're looking up "jail time. " Fine. I've seen this kid, he sneaks onto my farm and steals my hemp. Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed. - You ready to give me my discount now? - No. What have you done in here this whole time? - What kind of business is this? - A paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world! Dwight, knock it off. You'd better think about what you're doing. Think about what you're doing. No. I'm an adult. I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid. You're a little snot-nose punk kid who thinks he's better than everybody else. Because he's some hotshot. And you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay? - Sales? - Yeah, sales. You sell pizza. - That's called sales. - You're such a loser. - What did you call him? - A loser. - What did you say?! - A loser. Okay, stop it. Stop it! Stop getting him to say it! - You just made this worse. A lot worse. - I can make him talk. We are accomplices. Stop talking all at once! - You need to let him go. - Let go of little jerk boy? Before he has learned his lesson? - Yes. - You know what, Jim? World would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions. Yes, but not by kidnapping them. I'm not kidnapping him. I'm keeping him until I get what I want. As a hostage. - You over-think it. - You under-think it. Yes, is Alfredo there? May I speak to manager then? Okay, could you tell the manager that I am keeping his delivery kid until I get my discount on the eight pizzas I ordered? Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also, I would like him to throw in two- three pizzas just for our - Ransom. - trouble. Okay. All right. - What'd he say? - He said no. - So we should let him go. - No, no. Listen up, kid. I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights. I have to hang these. Why are you looking at her like that? Hey! What's going on? Michael called the pizza place with demands. Mr. Overdramatic. What's up, Kev? We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza from Alfredo's pizza cafe while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end. I needed another hour. It could have been done in another hour. I think it looks good. That's why you're not in charge, Meredith. Here you are, my dear. One thing made of ice. How did you Where- Where did you It's just ice. It'll melt all over the floor. - Will you help me put it over there? - Yes, I will. Excuse me. I stole it. Thank god. Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself. I'll just wave and introduce myself. - Quick question. - Yeah. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof? - I'm all over it. - Okay. What do we got here? - Good pizza. - Yeah? - Cheese, or do we have other flavors? - Different stuff. Which one's this? Perfect. Do you remember what you said to me on my first day at work, just before you walked me over to my desk? "Enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time "before you met your desk-mate Dwight. " And that's when I knew. You? You came up to my desk and you said, "This might sound weird, "and there's no reason for me to know this, "but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. " That was the moment that you knew you liked me? Yep. - Can we make it a different moment? - Nope. Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start. And now, from my old hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott. I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer. So take that, asshole. Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear. If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor. What are you doing? You said your upper back itched. - I didn't ask you to scratch it. - Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and because up until and possibly including now, I've repulsed you. - But I like you. - I'm not dating you. So Angela is stubborn as a mule. She's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested. But do I like her or not? Because if I like her, then I can't back down. If you're going number one, you've got ten more seconds! Hey, have you seen Jim? I guess he wanted get out of here before the cops find out. What are you doing? Scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're gonna do something to him. - I can hear you, man. - Shut up! Or I punch you in the throat! Stop it! Stop it! No. God. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I kidnapped a kid. You had to. What other choice did you have? I've gotta pay for the pizza. Well Yeah. Oh, my god. - This is Michael. - Hello, Michael, this is Ryan. - First off, thanks for the shout-out. - You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Why's there a kid on your web cam saying that he's being held against his I want you to go in there and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip. No more than 10%. - What will you do? - I will open the door. - Yeah? - And hopefully, he will walk out. And the rest is out of our hands. So I'm paying full price? Yes. Here we go. $65. You know what? Here's two more. See ya. Drive safely. Okay. Now what? Now we wait and hope that nothing happens. All right. I assume I'm going to be reimbursed? Not now, Dwight, please. Not the time. A toast. Better make it good. To avoiding a class 2 felony charge. Hello? Hey. Hang on a second. Hello? Hang on. If you change your mind I'll be first in line Honey, I'm still free Take a chance on me If you need me let me know Gonna be around If you got no place to go If you're feeling down If you're all alone When the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free Take a chance on me Gonna do my very best And that ain't no lie If you put me to the test If you let me try Take a chance on me That's all I ask of you, Angela. - Hey, how'd it go? - Yeah, what'd she say? I don't know yet. I've to call you back. - You gotta give us- - I'll call you back! I have to go clean up after the party. What a horrible day. Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York-style sushi today. And you know what? - What? - I'm gonna get it. Cooper says calamari. There's only one place to get New York-style sushi. - Tokyo? - New York. You wanna go? - Yes! - All right, you drive. Okay! - Nice! - Here we go. I'm sorry- You guys are gonna have to leave. Hey, you know what? Come on. Come on. Let's go! Hey, you're the Scranton guy. - Guilty. - I liked your statement tonight. Okay. Thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer. Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that. Yeah. See you later. Later on. I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would. Because it didn't work out for me. I'm very embarrassed. I have egg all over my face. And I'm 12 years old. I spent so much time in Scranton, but I never sold any paper. I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot. I started a fire with my cheese peeler. And dated an indian girl. I started a fire. Now I got a beard. And I have new shoes and I'm your boss. I'm hot. I'm so hot. - That- That's why everybody- - I don't get- I don't understand that. That's part of it. It's just Wanna head back? Yeah, let's go.
Coat! Michael just rent The Devil wears Prada. He has his netflix sent here to the office and he watches them in pieces when things are slow. Steak! Where's my steak? He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character. Get me Armani. A suit? On the phone. The main company number? 'Cause I'm gonna have to Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You're not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. I owe you an apology. - You finished the movie. - Yeah, it was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you. No, go ahead. Meryl Streep is the bad guy. You never see it coming. Anyway, if I was mean in any way to you, I'm sorry. I just want what's best for you, Minushka. Macushla. He's watching Million Dollar Baby. He's gonna try to kill me.

People said I have very pretty eyes. - You do. - I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine. Well they both go with the carpet that I've ordered. And if we go with the brown leather sofas, they go with that too. - We already have a sofa, so why d - A futon's not a sofa. It folds up. You've only seen it flat. - I know what a futon is, Michael. - I Okay. How much is it gonna cost? - It costs what it costs. - No - It doesn't even mean anything. - We've gone through this. Yes! Money has been a little bit tight lately. But at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No, I'm gonna be thinking about how many friends I have and my children and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well, money-wise. It's just, you know, you say it's gonna cost what - Yeah? - Michael, it's Ryan for you. Conniving little runt Put him through. Put him through. Yes?

Sure, I can hold. Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. Schrute farms. Guttentag. How can help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh, no, I'm sorry. No king beds. No queen either. We make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Auf wiedersehen. - Hey Dwight. - None of your business, Jim. - You running a bed and breakfast? - It's not a B & B. Agro-tourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfast. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them breakfast. - Department of Health know about this? - I am not telling you anything. Permits are pending. Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin. - I'm looking for a room. - Okay, this is a misuse of company phones. It says here you cater to the elderly. - Where did you read that? - Trip Advisor. Trip Advisor is the lifeblood of the agro-tourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you may as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn, one of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see. How many in your party? Two. We offer our tours of the fields and of the barn. Perhaps you'd be interested in Mose's table-making demonstration. So, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight. Actually, I need the car. Why? For improv? Why don't you just pretend that you have a car? Good practice in case you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car. Used to have two cars. Tred 'em in. Now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car's a Porsche For her. One cardigan. One sleeping cardigan. One sleep apnea mask. What about my cherub figurine? You took that with you. No, I left it on my night tab Your night table by the lamp. You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories and I didn't see it there. Fine. My girlfriend and I broke up recently and I must say I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition where when the male has sex with another woman he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his doorstep by his parents. You can use those oats to make oatmeal, bread Whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats. The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it is so important that you all come and applaud only for my band, Scrantonicity 2. Not Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. - Michael, can I count on you? - You cannot, I have a thing tonight. Damn it. - What? - That reminds me. If the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight. Oh, no. I've a thing tonight. - That stinks. - Darn it. Shoot. - How about this weekend? - No, can't. We only had tonight free and we really wanted to spend it with you. Damn it to hell! - All right. - What do you got going on tonight? You wouldn't understand. It's a secret. I wouldn't understand or it's a secret? You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret. I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate you've expressed interest in losing some weight. What if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in five minutes? How would that sound? Amazing, right? Well, it won't be that fast but it will It will be that easy. I can't believe this place is real. I'd heard about his beet farm for years, - but I never thought - The beets motel. The beets motel? - That is - Thank you. Borscht Hotel. The Embassy Beets. Radish Inn. - How are you doing this? - I don't know. Oh, my gosh. I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do enough of it as a manager, so I took this second job, kind of as a hobby. Some people have golf or relaxing. - What's going on here? - Hey, I just got off the phone and I was gonna make another call. We're a legit operation with a license from the city. I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commission. They're with me, so This is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars. We have three rooms, each with a different theme. What are the themes? America, irrigation, and night time. - Irrigation. - Yes. I'll put you down for irrigation. Now then, do you have any special needs or dietary restrictions? Yes, we will be requiring a bedtime story. No. - Not even Harry Potter? - Jim, come on. - But you promised. - Mose, bags, now. Here we are, irrigation room. A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we're completely wireless here at Schrute farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty. Everybody in the conference room in five minutes. These meetings are useless. I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Been proven to work. So make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it? Very inspirational. We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales, okay? - Or woman. - Or a trained seal. You can make jokes when you've made a sale there, rookie. Okay? I'd say one in six. What? I thought you asked me what are chances were of being murdered here tonight. You know, I just realized this is Pam's and my first night away together. I used to play it over in my head and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a nice hotel or a romantic dinner. Wine but wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure. Just less. This is beet food. Mose, what are you doing? No, Mose! Put the Put the manure down. Put it down. Do not throw it! Do not Yes, is Mr. Hudson there? Yeah, who is this? Well I'm just calling because you responded positively to Stanley? Why are you calling me here at home? Señor, are you happy with your long distance, sir? Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home? Have you con Have you considered satellite television? Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. - All right. - Why are you calling me here at home? When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats, drinking some red wine, watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole godforsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael scott. Your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy that the coach won't play him, frankly. My office. You bet. Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say the words exactly. Got it? I don't know why we keep having this conversation. Look, I know sales and I had that sale. I just needed a few more minutes. A few more minutes is a waste of our time! - It's not a waste of time. - It's a trading game. You give a quick pitch. You make the sale and move on. - That's how Vikram does. - He doesn't have my people skills. Good for Vikram 'cause he out-sells you every night. Well, I hope this conversation has helped. "And Harry saw "the white hand raise its wand "and felt Voldemort's surge "of vicious anger. "Saw the frail old man on the floor "writhe in agony. "Harry. "It was over as quickly as it had come. "Harry stood shaking in the darkness, "clutching the gate into the garden, "his heart racing." What did you get tonight? Oh, it looks like mixed marsala, eggplant, and rice. Oh, that looks good. And what about you? A peanut butter flavor again? I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening. - Enjoy. - Thank you. I was a surgeon back home. - Really? - Yeah. - Wonder what I would've been back home. - This is your home. I know, but I mean, it's so competitive here. What's the dollar worth in your land? Medical school must've cost, like, 40 bucks or a donkey or something. No. I would've been chief of surgery. Or a cowboy. - Wait, you're going out there? - Yeah. Coward. Oh, my god! What century is this? Here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard 1, the original, John McClain is just this normal guy, you know? He's just a normal New York city cop who gets his feet cut, he gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter in the air. You know? He's invincible. It's just sort of lost from Die Hard 1. It's not Terminator. Dude, you should review movies. Oh, my god, yes! - Yeah, you should! - I actually wrote a movie. - Really? - Well I'm writing one. - What's it about? - Sort of spy thriller. Hey, what's so captivating? I love captivating things. And this must really be captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean, time is your money. That's how I know how captivating it is because of how much time you've spent talking. He returned. Come in. Did you have another nightmare? - I thought you were Mose. - Does Mose have nightmares? Oh, yes. Ever since the storm. Is everything satisfactory with your stay? Yeah. - Yep. - Great. Just that I'd heard crying or moaning or something in here. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff. Good night, Dwight. Hey, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. - You wanna come? - We'd love for you to come. Thanks, no. I've to work in the morning, so - All right, next time. - Okay. See you guys. Hey, how are you doing? You drive. I had too much wine. Okay. - How was yoga? - I didn't go. - Why? Why not? - I just didn't. How was improv? - Good night, Vikram. - Night. - Congrats on the bonus. - Thank you, Michael. I'll nab it one of these nights. If you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah. - Good night. - Good night. - Morning. - Hi. Hey Dwight, how are you? Pam. You okay? I'm better than you have ever been or ever will be. Hey guys what's happening? How's my favorite branch doing? Michael, why don't you start us off. That wasn't much of an introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, your boss Michael scott. Still lame. Okay. All right Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay Today, we're going to be talking about Powerpoint. Powerpoint, Powerpoint, Powerpoint. Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation and yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation that he'd given me. But you know what else would've been nice? Winning the lottery. And the best way to start is to hit "start". And up comes the tool bar. That's what she said. What we have to do here is go to "run". And then, you look up to Powerpoint and we are in. We are going to register. You hit "register". "Updates are ready." I should update. "Estimated time 12 minutes." So it should take about 5 or 7 minutes. Is this the first time you've opened Powerpoint? Why? You didn't prepare it, did you? Know what? I had really rough night. And my boss can back me up on that. - I'm your boss. - My other boss, Mr. Figaro. You've another job? What I do beetween 5:30 pm and 1:00 am is nobody's business but mine and my other businesses. Are you a cocktail waitress? You cannot have a second job - if it affects your work here. - It won't. - It did already. - Okay. Honestly, it is unlikely that I was gonna figure this out anyway. - You're so funny. - Why is Darryl here? - He works in the warehouse. - I invited him. It's not a party. Darryl, downstairs, this isn't information you need. This information here? Yeah, you're right. I don't need this. Hey, come on. - See you later tonight. - I got plans later. Okay, bye honey. How long to get this presentation ready? Why don't you do the presentation? - I mean, you know how to do it. - What I really want honestly, is for you to know it so that you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. What? - It's whoever, not whomever. - No, it's whomever. No, whomever is never actually right. Well, sometimes it's right. Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students. No, actually whomever is the formal version of the word. Obviously, it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly. - Not a native speaker. - I know what's right. But I'm not gonna say because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night. - You know the correct one? - I don't know. It's whom when it's the object of the sentence, and who when it's the subject. - That sounds right. - It sounds, but is it? - Ryan use it as an object? - As an object. Ryan used me as an object. - Is he right about that? - How did he use it again? It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object. - Thank you. - To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object, which is the correct use of the word. No one asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull. Hey, this doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job or you're fired here. I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life, so You are filming history. Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full-time jobs. One here at the lipaphadrazone diet pill company. - Lipaphedrine. - The other, I was regional manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin. - Never heard of it. - In this dream, I did both of these jobs beautifully. And I loved it. And everybody loved me. The truth is - I can't do this. - Are you quitting? I am. Come back anytime. Don't forget to disinfect your headset. I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I trieto have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American Dream is that you can just go to sleep. And try it all again the next night. So What's up? Me, all night, dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body. - You're being gross. - Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her. I know she told you she's looking and she's totally not responding my moves. What moves? I've moonwalked past accounting, like, ten times. - Can't believe it's not working. - Yeah. I don't know if I really see you two together. Really? Well maybe you should look in the small part on your brain. - She's very religious. - Okay, well I come from a line of W.A.S.P.S. so long it leads back to Moses. Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously. She could be kind of severe. Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall. - That's right, you did. - Yeah. Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight or Angela or Andy. Hey Kevin, you're a gambler, right? A rounder. You play the ponies, tall horses. I do gamble, Michael. I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it and then doubling it, several more times. I don't know. Kind of just for fun. I was thinking Do you have any tips or ideas about sure things? Like a boxer who is gonna throw the big fight, you know, like he's tied in to some crooked dealings and maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that? The mob. Do you know anybody in the mob? Okay. Oscar I'm gonna need another advance on my salary. - What do you mean you've plans tonight? - I have my daughter tonight. We're renting Charlotte's Web. Well you have to make a choice. - It's either your daughter or me. - My daughter. Okay. I see how it is. That was cold. He's always been terrible with money. I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poorhouse. Yeah, women be shoppin'. I can't believe he has a second job. - He's not even good at his first one. - Hey guys. Whatcha talking about? Okay, I know what's going on. Talking about Jim and Pam. If they're having sex, what it looks like I know. Michael, are you having money problems? Monkey problems? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems? - I know you heard me correctly. - Oh, I hate monkeys. What's going on? Why do you have a second job? I don't have a second job. Maybe I am having an affair with Suzanne Sommers. - Jan has no money? - I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It's rude and unsexual. True, it's best to hide our money problems from women. I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems. All right, you know what? Watch this. If I had money problems, would I do this? - You just put it back in your pocket. - Yeah. Yeah, but I destroyed it. It's not even usable anymore. Hey, let's call this what it is. It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited everytime I see that little dude walk through the door. Well I just need to know where this is going. Hey, I like you. All right? Why's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side. Otherwise maybe this thing has run its course. Don't you dare walk away from me, Darryl Philbin. You're the most selfish person I've ever met Slow down. Think it over. Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking. What kind of game is that? Hey, cuz. - Heard you're having money problems. - No, you didn't. Listen, I got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems away. Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider. How would that help, Creed? In monopoly, you go bankrupt, you lose. You don't go by monoly, man. That game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "Get out of jail free" cards. Those things cost thousands. That is a good point. Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start. It's a clean slate. Like the witness protection program. - Exactly. - Not at all! I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start. No debts, no bagage. I've already got my name picked up: "Lord Rupert Everton." I'm a, uh, shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life. I declare bankruptcy! Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word "bankruptcy" and expect anything to happen. - I didn't say it, I declared it. - Still That's That's not anything. This is a lot of credit card debt. Yeah, tell about it. You know, Jan has my credit cards and she's using 'em as if I'm made of money. She thinks I'm a human ATM machine. Okay. $125, Amazon. Oh, Best of the Muppet Show on DVD. Classic. $1200. What's a "Core-Blaster Extreme"? That is by far, the best way to strengthen your core. This machine You sit on a stabilizer ball. You put your feet into the power stirrups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod. And you twist and you twist and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, your The marine corps actually uses it. I think that's how they got "corps." I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it 'cause I found it outside vance refrigeration all alone. And I told her in the note that the cat came to find her. That they were destined to be together. I got game. Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need. Like a car or a house. That is so cool how you have my name at the top. The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainments, things like that. This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment. How do you do this so fast? Is this Powerpoint? Oh, man. Angela really had a hold on him. Angela. Michael, I'm gonna set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator. - You meet with this guy - No. We're leaving Jan out of this. - She has to know. - We will find another way. We'll ask Powerpoint. Michael, this is a presentation tool. You're a presentation tool, if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this. - I'm done. - No, you're not Just You're not a tool. Look, I'll tell her that it's bad. But it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial footwork I was able to cut it in half. Jan is smart. She poses. Dwight, how's the hotel business? Stupid. You checked Trip Advisor recently? No Maybe you should. Maybe you should Whatever. We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote: "The natural aroma of the beets "drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times." "The dawn goose walk will tug at your artstrings." "Table-making never seemed so possible." "You will never want to leave your room." "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beetfarm." I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. We really did. It was fun. So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt. You're bro? How did you get that from what Oscar's saying? That's not I mean Michael, how did this happen? Where exactly did your money go? I I don't I don't get this. I really don't. I don't I don't understand how you could be so irresponsible. I mean It is astounding to me, really. - I don't know what more to say - Jan? - Yeah, what? - Michael left. - Okay, where did he go? - I don't know. Well is he coming right back? I don't think so. I'll be right there. What am I doing? I'm blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you'll call it. I'm running away from my responsibilies. And it feels good. You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign. No bars, no patios, no vegetables. And no seafood. Dwight. Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well It was all about Pam. Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it, Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. And then weird stuff, like, food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. And it is something that I would wish on my worst enemy. And that includes you. Hey, I was thinking about dinner Dinner Let's see, maybe we should try the new italian place where was the dry cleaner. - Okay. - Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Jim's just really passionate about italian food. Yeah, I'm very passionate about italian food. In fact I'm in love with italian food. - Jan, he went running that way - Okay, great. Thanks. Runaway train never coming back Runaway and I'm never coming back Michael? Hey, Jan. What's going on? Not much. - What's up with you? - Why are you sitting on a train? - Where are you going? - I'm out of answers, Jan. What does that mean? I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you. Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything, you know that. - I don't know that. - Creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world. - Electronically. - I'll stay off the grid. Michael, come on. Come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad. Yeah, it is. It is. I really messed up. Well When When my life fell apart and they And they screwed me in New York and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk me on the advice of council and my friends were just waiting for this to happen. - That's really nice of you to say. - Michael, no. What I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean No matter how badly I treat you or what l'm going through you just You are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So where's this train taking us? I don't I think the engineer left. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder Mifflin, and according to our records, you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, I can take care of that right now. Don't sell your implants, please. I'm keeping them. I know you like them. - They're kind of uncomfortable though. - It's nice though. - My nipples aren't as sensitive now. - Looks cute though.
Yeah, everything! It's all good! Phyllis. - Dancing babies! - Dancing babies. I love it! We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some airtime in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity, and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later, so it's not too shabby. Best ad ever?   Gimme a break     Gimme a break     Break me off a piece of that   I am totally blanking. What is the thing? - Nobody tell him! - What? No Why? You got it. You're so close.   Break me off a piece of that     Bre apple sauce   Break me off a piece of that apple sauce. I don't think   piece of that chrysler car   - Nope. -   football cream   Okay. Football cream. It's football cream. All right, so anybody else? I'm taking a computer animation class, so I could try to do a logo. Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good. Hello, hello. - How you doing? - Michael Scott, regional manager. - Nice to meet you. Us too, man. - Excited to talk ideas. You know what? I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know? Youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing. - That sounds great. - All right. This is what we have to work with. I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'nard dog. Who let the 'nard dog out? He gives the best back rubs in the office. That's true. I give a mean back rub. I also do good aromatherapy. Not! You just got 'nard dogged! Now this gentleman right here is the key to our - urban vibe. - Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you? Stanley's hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban aunt Jemima. These are our accountants. And as you can see, they are very different sizes. What you might wanna do is kind of a papa bear, mama bear, baby bear thing. - That might be kind of fun. - Mama bear. Who else? I think it's great that the company's making a commercial. Because not very many people have heard of us. When I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or And frankly, all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide. Episode 4x05 "LOCAL AD" - You playing that game again? - Second life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores. It doesn't have winners or losers. Oh, it has losers. I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my second life, I was also a paper salesman, and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same, except I could fly. Little girl in a field holding a flower. We zoom back to find that she's in the desert, and the field is an oasis. We zoom back further. The desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further. The hotel is actually the playground of the world's largest prison. - Zoom back further - Okay. I can tell your time's valuable. Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you. I get paid by the year, so That all sounds really ambitious. Yeah, I know. Why don't we show you what we did with the national branch. Okay. That's what national came up with? That sucks! That's what we came up with. We can do better than that. The main part of the ad must stay the same, actually. Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we've some leeway. The waving? Well no. You won't be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping, sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. I mean, this is where you really get to be creative. I need some advice. Been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. We've been necking, but only necking, right? Not actually kissing our mouths. Just a neck on neck. It's just like rubbing/nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not gonna lie to you. But it's a little weird. But you seem like a guy with answers. So how do I fast-track this, get to first base? We cannot talk about this, because someone might hear us. We'll use code names. Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight. That's not different enough. Dwike? You have a call from Eddie Murphy. Hello? Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello, Ry. - What? - Okay, calm down. I just have a small problem. I told you not to call about small problems. Well when I call about big problems, you don't like that either, so make up your mind, kiddo. Here is the deal. The ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box and sort of ignoring my ideas. That's good. They're creative, you're not. I'm creative, Ryan. It's not part of your job. It's like, maybe you can cook, but that doesn't mean you should start a restaurant. Well, actually I can't cook, and I'm starting a restaurant. "Mike's Cereal Shack. " I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store. I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skill set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right? But I'm good - at managing people who do sales. - Are you? I don't think you're doing such a great job here, suppressing ideas and creativity. All right, let me ask you this. Tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows and had a huge spike in its head. I was five. Five years old. Couldn't even talk yet. Hey, guys. You know what? We cannot shoot this ad today. - Okay, when should we come back? - How about never hundred hours, sir? - Wait, we were sent here to he - I'm not gonna argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck, dude. - Hey thanks. Thank you. - Thank you. Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people? Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again. - I'm on, Michael. - What's up, my brother? Listen, David. I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning. Take a look at it. If you don't think it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here and we'll do it on my dime. This is weird. I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it. Okay. I'll see it tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay. And thus Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative. " Yes. Well, they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. Who you talking to specifically? I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be kool-aid man. Younger, I always wanted to be an actor in commercials, then I realized I had a brain. I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around. We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write, so let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do make-up. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design obviously. I'd like you to look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area. Sue Grafton is at the steamtown mall! She's doing a book signing right now. Phyllis, this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe, people, all right? - Do not take no for an answer. - Okay. Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? - I mean, is she hot or - She's crazy hot. Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. - Would anyone notice? - That's not happening. I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated. - Light it up! - Get her, Phyl.   Out of paper Out of stock     There's friendly faces around the block     Break loose from the chains that are causing your pain     Call Michael or Stanley     Jim, Dwight, or Creed     Call indian Kelly for your business paper needs     Dunder Mifflin the people person's paper people     Dunder Mifflin the people person's paper people   Time out, time out. I thought I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap. What's rap? Okay, Darryl You need to learn about your own culture. I'll make you a mix. Great. News flash. I got some juicy updates on operation fallen angel. Remind me to tell you later. Hey. Eh, no talk. I'm animating. Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. Okay, this is Dwight's second life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Oh, my god. He's really in pain. Who's that? Oh, it's just my avatar guy, whatever. He looks a lot like you! How much time did you spend on that? Not much. - It's just for tracking Dwight. - Right. You're a sportswriter in Philadelphia? Nice build too. Yep. You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar. I Why don't we go back to the animation? No, no! I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim. Ah, show me how this works. Oh, boy.   Out of paper     Out of stock     There's friendly faces around the block     Break loose from the chains     that are causing you pain     Call Mike and Stanley Jim, Dwight, and creed     Call indian Kelly for your business paper needs     Call Dunder Mifflin     people person's paper people     Dunder Mifflin     people person's pape   Stop, stop, stop, stop. This is not me. This is not This is not my music. You're right. It's better than you. It's us.   Dunder Mifflin people person's paper   No, no, no I hate it! I hate it. I don't hate it. I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible. - You're on your own, Mike. - Okay, you know what? Hold on, Darryl. - You just said you hated it. - No, I said I I hate the style.   Break me off a piece of that lumber tar   -   Snickers bar   - Okay. This looks terrible.   break me off a piece   Andy, Andy! It's a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're gonna lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now? God, what? What, Phyllis? Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book. On my turn, I asked her if she wanted to be in the ad, and she said "No, thanks," but I wasn't supposed to take "no" for an answer. - That a girl. - So I kept on asking, and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends. Did you or did you not get Sue Grafton? No. Can somebody give her a tissue, please? Hope you're not killing yourself on it. 'Cause I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one. Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet. Okay. Do you want me to stay? No, no, you can go home. I'm good. Pam is staying late tonight to achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her. - Unfortunately, she was my ride home. - You comin'? I Piss or get off the pot. - Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. - Good morning. Yeah, sorry. I looked away for a second, and Creed snatched your hash browns. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide. Let me pour you some bubbly, because somebody got to a whole new level last night. Andy, I can't hear this right now. No, no, this is good. You know how we haven't gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night that changed. We're making out. I'm kissing her neck, and her cheek, and her earlobe. And she's not really kissing me back, but she closes her eyes and she's, like, "Oh, D. Oh, D." She called you D? Yeah. D for Andy. Oh, D. Oh, D. I'm about to send the ad to corporate. And it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I would. Okay. - Yes? - Pam, please clear my phone lines. Certainly. Okay, clear. They could call any second now. Oh, god. I better call. Well, it's been tough. The geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial. And tonight they are airing the brain-dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of corporate crapfest! - Hey, seemed like a big hit. - No, people are stupid. People like waving. Waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad. The real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full of heart. And it was real. Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the dvd player? Hey, everybody. Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial. The Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it. It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. Because ideas spread. They change, grow. They connect us with the world. And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time and bad news isn't always what it seems. Because when push comes to shove, we all deserve a second chance to score. Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world. Really good. Animation? All her, by the way. - Really? The animation was cool. - Thanks. You ever been on a motorcycle? Michael, that was fun. That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people.   Claude Van Damme     Hair for men     Poison gas     Nutrasweet   It's gotta rhyme with "piece. " Fancy feast!   Break me off a piece of that fancy feast   It's a cat food. Nailed it.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call. Yeah. - He's on line one. - Thanks, Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton? I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else. Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye. For the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay? - This is perfect! - He looks like your twin. This is a dummy, a la "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone. - I will know. But you will not tell anyone. I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah. Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay? I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here. - Just go out, and come back in. I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it. What? Hey, everyone, can I have your attention, please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her. Oh, I don't think that is what's happening. Well, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us? I think it's because of my sales record. That could not possibly be it. You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming. - How can I get you to stay? - Money. Yeah, we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so Tell me why you're really leaving. - Money. Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this: If I were - Money. Oscar, did you bring it? To be Edwardian. His best work. Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware. Sure thing Pam, can't wait. Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive. Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me. So tell me again why I can't be part of your club. Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny. - Oscar? - Some people. - Hello? - Fillipellers, how's it hanging? - Michael - To the left? - To the right? - Listen, I'm, I'm - Okay, enough small talk, go ahead. - You called me. Yes, listen You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this. I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him. No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby. Toby's not a salesperson. You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That was a bluff, Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours. - Goodbye Michael. - Okay, goodbye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople, please? Your best one? I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica. - Hi Ben, Michael Scott. - Hi, Michael. I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you 3 wishes: To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend. Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car? Get out. Yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby. Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately? No, I fired them, and you're next. - So what do you say? - Seriously? What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool fun branch. We're like Animal House. Found him! We're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it. - So what are you going to do? - What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. - Corcroan dropped Staples. - Did they? Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove what the hell is that music? - It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things. - That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? Oh My God, that's why people are leaving. I have no words. - We just passed the exit for Corcroan. - What? What? We did? Surprise! Look at his face! Look at his face! What are we doing? What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing? Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today. We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing. We're going to Utica? - I'm not going to Utica right now. - Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim. We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you. Utica! Utica! In your face. I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend. - Are you calling Karen? - No, I'm not calling Karen. - He's lying. - Yep, get it. What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight! Are you kidding me? No communication with the outside world, Jim. It had to be done, it had to be done. Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot. Hey, Dwight, he found it. You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here. Alright, you'll miss the best prank ever. Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing? - Do you really wanna know? - Oh, God. Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought. We brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs. - Or real bombs. - No, no, not real bombs. Yeah, come on, it will be so badass. Maybe, maybe, I don't know. - No. It could be badass. Yeah, it will. - No, absolutely we are not doing this. - Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas. it's going to be so badass! Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this in the trunk the whole time? Teach her to offer Stanley more money. So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache. So, why did you and Karen break up? - Was it the sex? - What? I can't imagine the sex being bad, - I mean her body is awesome. - Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about? - Okay, I will start. "A." "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell Damn it! What do we sell? Doesn't matter. - I'm trying to think of what we could sell. Doesn't matter. What is that? That sound The air-conditioning leaking or something? That doesn't make sense, couldn't be. What is that? Dwight, are you peeing? - I'm peeing in this empty can. - Oh my God! That is disgusting, Dwight! Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go. - Michael, watch the road! - Hey, you're making me spray! I'll kill you, man! - Michael! Michael, pull over! - That is just so disgusting! I think I cut my penis on the lid! Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside? I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic. And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right? - Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit. - What are you doing? Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious. I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club. The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety. Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading. Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club. - Why can't I be in the club? I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening. Believe it. - Afro wig, do you want the afro wig? - No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car. Alright, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I Guy's going by. You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. Then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place. And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk. No, no, you won't do that. Nope. Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes. Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please? Okay, Jim. Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go. Let's move! Move, move, move, move! - Shut up! - This is the dumbest thing we've ever done. I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention. Damn it! To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh - Yes! Damn it! Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer. - Very brave. - Very brave choice, I thought also. And George, his youthfulness. His, um, freedom. Evokes, um, feelings - What are you microwaving? - Popcorn. Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis? Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn. So, Stanley, are you really outta here? Yep, looks that way. I'm gonna miss you, man. You've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch. - We are in a stairwell. - We are climbing some stairs. - I'm breathing heavily. - Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me. - Well - There's a guy, there's a guy. There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof? Oh my God, that was very close. - I can see the security guard's eyes. - No, no, don't do anything to them. I have to do something to his eyes. The eyes are the groin of the head. Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home. We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier. - Isn't that thing huge? - It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running. No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this. - My hip bone! - We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ow, my leg! Jim, leave us. - Save yourself! - Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all- - Dwight, you gotta move! - Damn it guys! - Dwight, could you move over a little bit. - I'm losing control of my bladder. Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back! Did you say Karen? Take her to a motel, make love to her, Jim. No, I'm not doing that. - Just say you wanna get back together. - No, I'm not doing that! It doesn't have to mean anything. Just do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something. Host the Dundies. Hey, Karen. What are you doing here? First of all, hi. What are you doing here? You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier. Copy that. I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform felt pretty good. Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted? Listen, lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people. I'm taking Stanley. Then we will burn Utica to the ground. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. - Jim, hang on a second? - Yes. So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh? Yeah, trying to quit though. If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult. Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy to be seeing you right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you I mean, it's just that You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see you. Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you. - Alright. You are welcome. I'm going to go because of the traffic. - Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic. I will We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away, sweet little bird, fly away and be free. I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad. Wanted: middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart. I can't do this. A word? Of course. I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job. Really? I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? Sometimes I say crazy things. I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility. Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club? Come on! Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I. Did you get it out of your system? Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was a fun read. Fun? - Really? - Yeah. What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins? No, that wasn't fun. - Did you even read it? - Of course I read it. - How does it end? - Who was the main character? Angela. Nope. The ashes.
I really didn't think I was gonna have a good time but I did. I love camping.   Anything can happen   Well it wasn't camping. It was more of a wilderness retreat. - Morning. - Michael. Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him. Did you sleep in cabins? Under the stars. It was really beautiful. You should've come. Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited. - Who went? - Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany, and Ryan obviously. We had so many s'mores I finally had to say, "no more s'mores, no more s'mores. " Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point so just wrap it up. Michael wasn't invited. Episode 4x07 "SURVIVOR MAN" Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping And you know what "hypothetical" means? - Not real. - Got it. So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, - would you go? - Absolutely, yes. When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes. - Really? - Yeah. Do you wanna go today? And I am always busy. Oh, can't go today 'cause I'm donating blood. How often can you actually donate blood? Is there a limit? I don't Your body only has a certain amount. Well is that it, or Yeah, just this whole Toby camping thing. I don't know. It seems a little lame. - How so? - A bunch of guys in a tent making s'mores? - What's that? - Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. Here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself in the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys if your plans change. - Not gonna change. - I want to do it myself. I want to go and find out something about myself. I want to get out of here. All the cliques and the office politics. Fluorescent lights and the asbestos. - I thought we had that looked at. - I'm sick of this place, Jim. When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called Survivorman, and it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out into the middle of nowhere and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed. Okay, I will only need two things: a roll of duct tape and a knife. - I'm on it. - Okay. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipt. - Hey, what - Let's see if any of these will work. I keep various weaponry strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the workplace. " Well I say it's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally than by a stranger on purpose. Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day. Do you want me to ask where you're going? - No. - Great. Dwight'll be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. - The choice is yours. - No. The choice is actually yours. - Are you sure you wanna do this? - Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. - Don't try to follow me. - Great. This is a very personal, private experience in the wild that I wish to share - with me, myself, and I. - Yep. When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being. That'd be great. Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostel environment? Let's put it this way. No, I do not. This is what a true survivorman does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You can only wear the clothes that you have on. And you can only use the stuff that you have in your pockets. Now in this case, this disaster is a serial killer, creepy guy who's abducted me, and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape. Well yes, I would and I would survive. I'Id make sure that you were dead, believe me. Then I'Id remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you couldn't be identified. And they would call me the overkill killer. You are as creepy as a real serial killer. - For real. Okay - What are you doing? I'm putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we - What are you doing? - It'Id be better if you're unconscious. God! Dwight, stop it! Stop it! Do you want to do this right or not? Please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life? Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. Wasn't it just someone's birthday? Yes, Kelly's was last week, remember? - I do remember, yeah. - It's birthday month. Creed's is today, Oscar's is week after next, Meredith's is at the end of the month. Michael usually goes with red an You know what? I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party? What? There are 13 people working in this office. So 13 times a year, Michael gets a cake and balloons and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. And there are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are. Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug. And the other is something inappropriate or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to Happy birthday. And he is a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even arguably, possibly to a fault. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! So I think, yeah I think getting these out of the way might be productive. We can just have one big fun party. And everybody's happy and nobody wastes their time. I don't like it. You're shaking things up a bit, huh? - It's a pretty good idea, uh? - You think it's a good idea? No I think it's a great idea. We're here. Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. Here we go. Just the two of us. Here we go into the wild to the mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature? Keep going. You're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets. Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. Try sending them another invoice. - Okay. - All right. Oh, did you see my memo, by the way? "Let's be honest. As fun as birthday's are "we all could use a break from the constant cake. "So let's celebrate birthday month in style today. " This is really cool. - Right? - Yeah. I was just think No, totally. Totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. Right! Exactly. I knew I could count on you. This is as good a spot as any. What are you doing? - Stop it. Dwight, just stop it! - I'm just Spin I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction! Behold. Good. Thank you, Dwight. - Here's your knife. - Thank you. - And here's your duct tape. - Good. - All right. - Very good. Okay. Yep. - Good luck, Michael. - Thanks for the ride. Okay Leave me be, Dwight. Hey Jim, can I have my own cake? - What's that? - I really prefer devil's food cake. Oh, sure. - Yes, awesome! - Okay. - That was easy. - People like me I guess. Jim. - I hate devil's food. - I think Meredith Screw Meredith. It's not fair someone else pick the cake on my birthday. - Everybody's birthday. - Today is my birthday - and I wanna pick the cake. - What you want? I want pie. I want peach pie. I want a nice cobbler. I'm gonna talk to Angela to see what we can do. No matter who you talk to, make it happen. - It'll be Angela. - You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means. Day one. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape in case I need to fashion a shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant which would make it about Really beating down on me now. And I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. Okay. Oh, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my carotid artery here. I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support. But I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity. There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts. I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. See this is a beautiful piece of material. This could be used for all sorts of things. Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable. - Tuna. - Andy. Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? - "Fudgey the whale. " - Not your birthday. Well I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a fudgey the whale. All right. Gonna look into it. But the answer's no. Wow, okay. Harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. Hey Andy, I have some calls to make. - Loud and clear. - All right. - Pizza rolls. - I'm gonna go into this office here to do some work so I will be in here. Mushroom caps. I am totally alone right now with only my thoughts. I love it.   I'm lovin' it   I can literally say anything I want. No one is going to hear me. Wish I could've gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I- have-hemorrhoids! Doesn't even matter. Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. But I hope he finds it. Lunch. Well it is a little chillier than I had thought so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in. It's time for me to find some nourishment. Now these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like squirrels. A nice, juicy rabbit would be delicious. About two more minutes. I have made this spear with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. Starting to feel it a little bit. It's Creed's birthday today.   Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday dear Cre-ed     Happy birthday to you   Happy birthday, buddy. What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday. So what if there's a lot of them. Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break. I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. - Why don't you have an apple? - Why don't you mind your business? Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago so he doesn't care. - I think the power went to his head. - Hey, Jim! - Hey guys, what are we talking about? - Nothing. Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. Come on, gang. Well if you take a look at this I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper someday. Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is on. - Hey, Jim. - Toby. Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. Oh, thanks, man. Yeah. Is there anything I can My birthday was two months ago. - Oh, okay. - There was no party. - What? - Well there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. Mmm, I remember that. I just thought, maybe you could - include me. - Seriously? I just thought you could add me in. I don't know what the harm in that is. Toby's great. He's great. But sometimes he can be a little bit much. "I don't see the harm in that. " Well it's a cake, Toby. So, come on. You know what? We're gonna throw you in because the more the merrier. No, no way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't change plans willie-nillie and expect this little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devil's food, peach cobbler, "fudgey the whale," mushroom caps I'm allergic to mushrooms. That's a bummer. Okay Then we need to Hey, everybody. Hi, how are you doing? Can I have your attention? We've to talk about this birthday thing. - Conference room? - Yes, conference room. Five minutes. No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're gonna talk about it out here. So who has problems with the birthday thing? One, two, three Everybody. Okay, so then we just shouldn't do it. What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie? - Ooh, I'll take 'em! - Well nobody's touching my cobbler. Hey Michael I mean Jim. Yep, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact. Under this tree, I think I struck the motherload. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say, these little buggers are damn tasty as well. No! No, Michael! No! Give 'em up!   Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday to you     Happy birthday dear Creed     Happy birthday to you   Yeah!   Skip around the room     Skip around the room     We won't   Okay, all right. Yike, don't to that. You're gonna break something. Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he like to have warmth and clothing and television and hamburgers and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air because I have the freshest air around: A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky. - Hi, buddy. - Hey. Word up. Sure glad you're back. You are relieved. You have no idea. So what did I miss? Well I tried to put all the birthdays together at once. - So terrible idea. - Yeah. Okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. - You did do it? - Yeah. Just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. Well I don't think I'll be here in ten years, but That's what I said. That's what she said! - That's what who says? - I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension when things sort of get hard. That's what she said. Hey! Nice! Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again I'll call back. You never call back. Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a post-it note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is, he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every ten minutes. Tell him I'll call him back. - You can't just work 200 days a - Sorry. No, no. I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. So You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this. I can get you a tutor if you need This is a very important client. But I have the most important client sitting right in front of me my boss. - So I'll call him back - No. Customer service is obviously priority one. - You take the call. - N No, money isn't everything, Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't wanna be rude. Take the call, friend. I refuse. No. My house, my rules I insist. I insist you take your work calls. Okay. All right, Pam, would you put the call through. Hiya, buddy.

Yeah, I hate that. So here's the deal. I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination lawsuit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs. And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behaviors. Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? My - I'm feeling a little queasy. - No, I want it up. My hair. Remember, it's not just a pattern. It's a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behaviors. Disree. My friend Disree got new specs. Disree spect. My friend Inapro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor. - Does this work for you? - Yep! Tell 'em how much you're gonna get if you win. - Michael, that's tacky. - $1 million! - That's 4 million. - $4 million! Man! That is a lot of guacamole. Lot of green. Lotta green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers. And I've also thrown in some ers and ahs just to make it seem like it's not memorized. Perfect crime. Stop saying ridiculous things. He's gonna tell the truth. The truth is very, you know, complicated. So we went over it carefully, and just not to leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment. Could we please pull over and pull down the top? - I don't feel good. - I told you. I'm not putting it down! - I'm gonna puke. I'm gonna throw up. - Fine, just a second. Hold on. Schneider, real quick. What is a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff? A good start. And I think it's "busload." Yeah, but rich lawyers took the bus. Where'd you find this guy? - Hey, there he is. Hey, hey. - Hey, Michael. Jan. I'm glad you're here. I need to talk to you. Can we talk off the record? As friends. I would love that. Jan has put the company in a very tough position here. You're with us for a long time. Over ten years, right? We just wanna be sure you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand? Abso Really, yeah. I'll I'll do anything for the company. Good. That is great to hear. It is. Game, son! Okay, let's run it back. The warehouse got a ping-pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes, I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12. What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping-pong? - Hi, Kelly. - Guess whose boyfriend it is? - I don't wanna guess. - I'll give you a hint. It's not my boyfriend. I think it's the guy over here. I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is all hypothetical, like, "Your mom is so fat, she could eat internet." But smack talk is happening, like, right now. Like, "You're ugly, and I know it for a fact, 'cause I got the evidence right there." Jim Can I see you for a second? Sure. Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You've to get really good and beat Darryl. I can't beat Darryl. Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl's beating you. What? Seriously? What is she saying? Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball. Jim couldn't hit a ping-pong ball of the size of the moon. Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping-pong? So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly? Sorta, yes. - Bring me players. - Okay. Hi, everyone, Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel. Hi. No, no. Absolutely not. What is he doing here? Are you renewing your divorce vows before my deposition? Michael, I'm your H.R. rep. I'm on your side. No. I want him gone. - I don't talk until he leaves. - Michael, just relax. I think they're ready for us now. - Okay. - Thank you. Mr. Scott, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? "Yesh." Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination? Well, it was not just a termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior. Very good. Well put. People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater. Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you. - About what? - He needs help balancing some travel receipts. Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts. Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room. Awesome! How long have you known the plaintiff? I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen The Firm, and I plan on renting The Pelican Brief. How long have you known Ms. Levinson? Six years and two months. And you were directly under her the entire time? - That's what she said. - Excuse me? That's what she said. Ms. Levinson told you that she was your direct superior? - Why would she say that? - Can we move on to another question? I don't understand. Who's on record as saying this? With all due respect, I'm the middle of a line of questioning. Now, Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position? Come again? That's what she said. I don't know what If I may, he was telling a joke before. So can we move on to another question? - Are you sure? - Yes. Can you go back to where this digression began? Mr. Schneider: "And you were directly under her the entire time?" Mr. Scott: "That's what she said." Well Delivery's all wrong. She's butchering it. Yeah, that's what I thought. Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired? She thought it had to do with the twins. - That's what I call them. - Can you be more specific? Who are the twins? To be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. - They make milk. - You don't need to go any further. - Her breasts. - Yes. She thought it had something to do with her recent breast surgery. Yes, and, frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant. What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination? Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules. Interesting. How so? Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to H.R. And I have the proof right here! Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, - if that's okay with you. - I will allow it. Would you mind, please, just taking a quick look at this photograph, please? That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica. Is that correct? And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to the start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the time line here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin? Well, depends on how you define "began." If it was from the first time we shook hands, it's like six years ago. The first time we kissed, it's like two years ago. - Excuse me? - From the first time we kissed sober, it was four months after that. - Could we take a short break? - No. Are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in february, as you previously testified to here? - Line. - I'm sorry, what? He asked for a line, like in a play. "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes." "Can I go to the bathroom?" "I really have to. I've been drinking lots of water." "You went 5 minutes ago." "It wasn't to go to the bathroom. "but to get out of a question." "You've to answer it." "First, can I go to the bathroom?" "No." Good game, Meredith. - Don't patronize me. - All right. - What is going on here? - Dwight! Thank god you're here. It turns out one of our biggest clients is a ping-pong master. And I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice? - What the hell? - I told you. All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wong Tao, Jorg Rosskopf, and, of course, Ashraf Helmy. I even have a life-size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go to the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba. Jan and I had an on-again, off-again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case. And I am sorry. But I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition. Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know. Wait We'd like to enter in the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal. What are you doing with my diary? This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated January 4 of this past year. "Just got back from Jamaica. "Tan almost everywhere. "Jan almost everywhere. "Hee hee. "Oh, diary, what a week. "I had sex with my boss. "I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. "Jan was very specific "that this is not going anywhere. "That it was a one-time mistake. "But we had sex six times, so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie." Irie. Irie, sorry. "More tomorrow. Xoxo, Michael." It would appear that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word, is that correct? We'll need to see a copy of that entire journal befo I don't think anyone in this room has a right to read my diary. Basic discovery. We've the right to review it. Okay, let's make ten copies of this diary. Could you make it 11? And we'll break for lunch so everyone can have a look. Can I sit here? You know, I I know a little bit about what you're going through, in a way. When I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody. And they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know. I didn't want them to get divorced in the first place. I loved them both so much. I just wanted How could you give up my diary? I had to. I'm sorry, but I need to win this. We need to win this. How'd you even find it? It's under my side of the mattress. I don't like the lump. I'm really upset. All right, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You e-mailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. - Let's call it even. - Fine. I love you. I love you too. Mr. Scott, who is this other woman Ryan, who you refer to here as "just as hot as Jan, but in a different way." Not a woman, just a cool, great-looking best friend. We're trying to determine whether Michael and Jan were engaged in a romantic affair. Not Michael and this Ryan person. - Excuse me. - All right. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan. And, yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly did not consider me to be her boyfriend. - So her actions're completely rightful. - Okay, Mr. Scott. It's admirable, the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you. Thank you. You didn't have to say that. Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews. That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce. And she was drinking a lot. Okay. Of water. Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind reading the date on that, please? March 17th. And that would be a month after your relationship became official. - Is that correct? - Yes. You may read the highlighted portion out loud, if you want to. "I'm out of carrots. "I'm out of sticks. "Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself "to be an unmanageable employee "and a poor branch manager. "I recommend he be removed from that position and reassigned to sales, where he belongs." After hearing that, wouldn't you say that Ms. Levinson's judgment is at least very seriously flawed? Mr. Scott? How's it going? Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable. Check this out, though. Spin serve. Wow, it works, like, Nice. So should I schedule the rematch with Darryl now? I'm ready. I'll make the call. Wait a minute. Darryl is the client? Oh, no, no. He works here, dumb-ass. Right. Spin serve. How could you do that to me? You can respond, but remember, it's going into the record. Michael, I'm not the enemy, okay? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy. Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect with loyalty. They were going to give me your job, and I should have taken it. Wait Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, okay? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition. Starting at paragraph six. Counsel: "Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott, "was he a contender to replace Jan levinson?" David Wallace: "Yes." See? I was number one contender. I was being groomed. Counsel: "Was he your first choice?" David Wallace: "Michael Scott is a fine employee "who has been with the company many years." Counsel: "Was he in the top five of contenders?" David Wallace: "What do you want me to say? "Come on. He's a nice guy. "I considered many people." Counsel: "Was he being seriously considered for the corporate job?" David Wallace: "No." I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees? Absolutely not. Yes! Way to go. See that? Yeah, the floppy-haired girl you date won a point. Nice, baby! Nice one!   Hey, hey, you, you     I don't like your boyfriend     'Cause, 'cause     'cause he sucks at ping-pong   I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me! - What? - Let's go. Pick up a paddle. - Okay. Bring it on. - I am. - Think you can handle this? - In my sleep. Okay. Volley for serve. P. O. P. O. Do you wanna go play on the table upstairs? Yes. Michael I'm very sorry. No biggie. Just No. No, no, no. Hey, this was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry. Hey, David Yeah? I think you're a nice guy too. Thanks, Michael. Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York. So You expect to get screwed by your company. But you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend. What do you wanna do for dinner? How 'bout chinese? We should really try to save some money. Get something cheap. That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion. Wanna do fast food? Fine. Fast food's fine.
This is ridiculous. Do you have any idea what time we get out of here? Nobody likes to work late. Least of all, me. - You have plans tonight? - No, I don't. Remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we were working? Yes, I remember. This is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am gonna call corporate. Enough is enough. I'm God, I'm so mad! This is Michael Scott, Scranton. We don't wanna work. No, we don't! It's not fair to these people! These people are my friends, and I care about them! We're not gonna do it! Everybody, I just got off the horn with corporate, and basically I told them where they could stick their overtime assignment. - Go enjoy your friday. - Thank you, Michael. - I think we dodged a bullet there. - I think you did. I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa A little dinner, dancing, drinks? - Oh, I - You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said. Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least nine times. An every time, we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit. He got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate. Michael, what time should I be arriving? Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses. So it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim. And Angela and Andy. Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?

Except for one flower, which is for my flower. What am I supposed to do with this? How'bout we do the short tour, and then I'll start dinner? Oh, I can help starting dinner, if you need it. The osso buco needs to braise for about three hours. Everything else's done. Three hours from now, or three hours from earlier, like 4:00? You know, Pam, in Spain, they often don't even start eating until midnight. When in Rome. You have a preference? Upstairs first? - Whatever you say, babe. - Follow me. All right. How'bout a toast? Shall I? Here's to good friends. - Cheers. - Cheers. Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth. What was that? So music? Should we turn some music That sounds good. Do you guys remember my old assistant, Hunter? He is an excellent song writer. Wait to hear this. Okay, here we go. You took me by the hand Just made me a man That one night You made everything all right So raw, So right All night, all right Oh yeah! So raw, so right, All night, all right Oh yeah! You know what? Hunter was a terrible assistant. - That's why Ryan fired him. - He's probably just as reliable as Pam, because it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me. Sometimes I think she olds on to faxes. I don't care what they say about me. I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for. At a dinner party. - Cow. - No, it's a hump. There's a hump. - Joe Camel. - Yes! Okay, yes. First name of that animal, and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital. Montana. - Joe Montana? - Yes! Yes! - Time's up! - All right, two pieces! Why don't say 49ers quarterbacks? All right, my my My my turn! My my my my turn! My my my my turn! Babe, can you just, like, really - You're just, like, really - What? - What? - Could you just simmer down? - I'm just making people laugh. - No. - Yes, I was watching Jim's face. - I was watching Jim. And he was laughing. No smile. Look at him. He's laughing. Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game. And it's called, "Let's see how incomfortable we can make our guests." And they're both winning. So I am going to make a run for it. I just got a message from my landlord. Apparently, my apartment flooded. - Something with the sprinkler. - Oh, no! Pam, we should probably get going to see the damage. - Okay. - You don't need two of you to do that. That's true Dinner sounded delicious. Pam, I'll see you at home. Thank you so much. Oh, Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself. I don't know, everything I own is there. You can buy new stuff, but you can't buy a new party. That's true. That is a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends, and we're not gonna think about all your stuff being destroyed. All right? - Michael, you're up. - Here we go. This is gonna be fun. - Ready - Go! All right. First name is Tom. No, no, no. No names. No names, no rhyme no soundalikes. All right, okay. You're getting into my head! First name is blank, and he goes on a cruise. He goes on a caribbean cruise. - I don't know. - Katie Holmes. - No, but he's married to her! - Oh, Dawson's Creek. No, it has to be a real person Jim. Come on! No, no, I'm gonna pass. I'm gonna pass. - Rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger. - No rhyming! Not really a rhyme. Another clue! Okay, he's the governor of California. - He is the terminator. - Those aren't helpful. - Tom Cruise! - Time! God! Does anybody read the paper?! Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The, um sliding glass door shattered. - So - It's okay. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it, babe or should I tell it? - I don't like that story, babe. - Come on! It's a cute stor Michael ran through the sliding glass door because he thought he heard the ice cream truck. Stop. Stop it! I mean, I like ice cream, okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue. She loves lawsuits. You know, honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible. You are so right. You are so right! Because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges. And I moved in and I cleaned it, so I guess that makes me the devil. You are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! - I'm burning. Help me. - You shouldn't joke about that. - Is there more wine in the kitchen? - I will get it. I will get it. What kind of hostess would I be if - It's okay - No, no. In fact, you know what? Girls' trip. Angela, come on. Girls' trip. Oh, not even close. So you keep a very tidy house. You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath. - But I don't need to tell you, Pam. - Oh, yeah What? Oh, don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated. Oh, are you joking? Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him. I have never, ever dated or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever. I've noticed how you look at him at the office. So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand. So, Jim, I noticed you checking out Jan's candles. Oh, no, she just put it in front of my face. Yeah Did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan." - What do you think about that? - Thought about it. I'm in. I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company? I'm sorry. What now? Coming. Hello. What are you doing here? We came here to eat dinner and to party. This is a dinner party, right? - Awesome! - What is he doing here? - Yes, what are you doing here? - Dwight is friend. We weren't invited? You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person. Fine. Whatever you want. Just like always. Whatever you want. Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. - It's fine, Michael. - When I wanted to see Stop and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see? We saw Wic When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said that you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then, when you said that you might wanna have kids, and I wasn't so sure, who had the vasectomy reversed? And when you said you definitely didn't want? Who had it reversed back? Snip, snap! Snip, snap! Snip, snap! - I did! - Okay You have no idea the physical toll that three vasectomies have on a person! And I bought this condo - to fill with children. - I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world. - Okay? But look - Sorry too. If you want to have kids, then fine, you win. Let's have a fuckin' kid! You mean it? You wanna have a kid? I hate my life. So can we come in? Great turkey leg. Okay, I'm just gonna check on dinner. Angela, would you like some of my beet salad? I hate beet salad. It's actually really good. I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times. The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit. Pam I hope she didn't do anything to the food. Like what? I can't prove it, but I think she might be trying to poison me. - Hey, looks great, babe. - Yeah, it really does. I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table, wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover. Can you not do that? It's disgusting. You know I have soft teeth. How could you say that? Excuse me for a second. So How do you guys know each other? I was his babysitter. And now you guys are dating? It's purely carnal, that's all you need to know. Would you write down your email? Because I have just so many questions. Email? Never mind. All right. There we go. There. - That's nice. - Everybody enjoy their meal. Hey, babe. How'bout we take the beer sign down until our guests leave, and then we can discuss it? No I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together. Okay. Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good. At least he's an artist. B.F.D., I'm a screenwriter. And I'm a candle maker, but you don't hear me braggin'about it! No, all you do is you get me to try to work on my rich friends. For an investment opportunity! Man, I would love to burn your candles! You burn it, you buy it! Oh, good, I'll be your first customer! You're hardly my first. That's what she said! That is a $200 plasma screen TV that you just killed! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! - I'm gonna get going. - Fine, get out of here. It's getting late. You know what, she'll be out of the bathroom soon. Of course. Get out of my way. I'll take care of this. Okay, what seems to be the problem, officers? Not now, Dwight. We got a call about a disturbance? No. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party. Your neighbors heard shouting. Yes, there was screaming, but My girlfriend threw a dundie at my TV. A plasma. - You want to press charges? - Would she get into trouble? Yeah, she'd be charged. I will take the fall. - I did it. - You don't have to press charges. You could just try to be more quiet. - Michael! - Yes. What what are you doing to him? Sir, do you have any other place you could stay? Maybe with one of your friends here? Michael can come home with me. Jim, Pam? - Oh, my apartment's on fire. - Flooded. You people! - Come on, you're sleeping with me. - No. - I'm gonna take you home, Michael. - No. Come with me. All right. Bye, babe! This is the best burger I've ever had, babe. Babe, I should have told you, but I did something bad. I stole this. For you, babe. I love that.
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their cruise are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get. So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there. Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today, Jim. Oh, today we saw a junkyard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken. Nature. I've been here 9 years, and suddenly I'm supposed to park half a mile away. I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar. I will quit. As God is my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed. Some of us like the walk more than others. It hurts like hell. Episode 4x10 "CHAIR MODEL" Did you pick a new chair? It's been a while. Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. But instead you found something to distract you from picking out a chair. Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these: I really want it. - Have you ever seen this woman? - Her? The one in the really great mesh, black, hi-back swivel chair? Look at her smile. It's the eyes. Look at her eyes. She's got I don't know what it is exactly. She dresses like a professional, and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch. Or in a great chair. Yeah, maybe, but Remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women? I definitely remember your dinner party. I think what I meant was that I am completely swearing off one woman: Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. Actually, I put the catalog in your hand 'cause you have to pick out a new chair. What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic, because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results. Ladies and gentlemen, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85? - Yo, is this his new chair? - No, he hasn't picked one yet. When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go. I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So FYI, for those of you who're thinking about fixing me up, with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all. I left my cell phone in my car. Call us when you get there so we know you're okay. Listen, man I am completely over Jan. So would you set me up? If I had somebody to set you up with, Michael, then I'd take her for myself. - I thought you were engaged. - Nope. Stacy broke up with me. What? God, that's terrible, man. She's crazy. Um, are you still on good terms with any of her friends? Not anymore. It's a bitter situation. Yeah She's You don't deserve her. All right. Hello, Oscar Meyer weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl-type friends who trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em 'cause of your condition. - Michael? - What? I have a friend who's single. Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality too. Feisty So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer? No, she's a professional softball player. - Catcher or in field? - I don't know, Michael. Is she a dress-wearer or a pants-wearer? Could we share a rowboat? Could a rowboat support her? What are you asking? I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average-sized rowboat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you're not answering the question. No, all right? She can't fit in a rowboat. Damn it! I knew it! I knew it, Phyllis! What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them, and they're just hanging me out to dry. Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me but it is, and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well fine, here goes. - I don't think that - Now okay, I know that this is probably not appropriate. But I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens, I need to get laid. And before that happens, I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear, "I don't know, I can't help, na na na." No, no, I am a catch, and I am not going to be the one who got away. So this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards, and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour, or you are fired. Write legibly, people. Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot. - It's, like, a 10 minute walk. - No, 30. Look, I have an assigned parking place in front, so All right, all right. Let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.

No. I did this for the little guy. For Joe six-pack, the guy who wakes up every morning in his $400 a month appartment, wonders how he's gonna pay his mortgage this month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how am I going to pay my kids' orphanage bills? That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park. How did she die? I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and ploughed into the sight of an airplane hangar. - God - Yeah. She was so innocent. She was stoned apparently. You know, I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me. But now I know that that's just silly. Because she's dead. What do you do? You wait till next year's chair catalogue comes out and find someone who's still alive. - You move on. - Yeah. Where do you wanna go for dinner? I don't know. I kinda hate all our regular places right now. You know what? That one Hey, Pam. Will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? - I hate you. - What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh, my god! You thought I - No, no, no. - How could I have thought that? Bye, bye, miss chairmodel lady I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice We had lots of kids Drinking whiskey and rye Why d'you have to go off and die? Why d'you have to go off and die? You believe in rock'n roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And then, can you have to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym - Kicked off both her shoes - Turned off her shoes - No more rhythm and blues! - No verdict was returned! Rhythm and blues. This will be the day that I die
What's wrong, Michael? I got gum in my hair. - You do. - This just stinks. Don't touch it. Please, don't touch it! - You got a ton of dandruff. - Okay, let me be. How'd you do? I was walking in and I noticed something shiny under Stanley's car. And I gone under seeing what it was and I messed up my hair. All for a stupid piece of tinfoil. But, best-case scenario, you thought it was a quarter. Kill me, right now. We have peanut butter in the kitchen. I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich. Nope, not for you, it's for your hair. And it's 9:00 AM. Dwight, not the good peanut butter People are gonna get mad. This is my hair we're talking about. Smells good. - Taste good, too. - Oh, don't, that's disgusting. Lot of calories. Well, just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging, please. Yeah, that's nice. Episode 4x11 "NIGHT OUT" Hey, Michael, how was your date last night? I will be honest. The dating has not been going well. Look Men are visual creatures. We crave beauty. Like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists. Or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude. That, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are Not that they aren't nice or that have great personalities. They just They just lack a certain Crawfordness. I am livid. Absolutely livid. It's ridiculous. Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one saturday so they can reenter sales that they made on the phone, as sales made by the website, which they should've done in the first place If the website had been working. My favorite branch. How's everybody doin'? Man, you mind if I run something by you? Love it! Go. Well, I kind of feel like what we had going for us is our customer service. And no matter how much we change this up, I don't know that a website's gonna be able to replace that. I can tell you've thought about this. I appreciate that. - Thanks. - David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right? - I I don't - You did, yeah. Watch your back, Jim. I'm just kidding. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he's the reason we've to come in tomorrow. However, I swear to God, if any of you hurts him in any way, emotionally, or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half-beard Okay. Thanks, Michael. I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder-Mifflin Infiny - and fill in your questions. - Question. Why am I being forced to pretend a website made sales that I made? This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site. I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website. I'm not seeing commissions on that. I hear you, Stanley. That is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we'll launch Dunder-Mifflin Infiny 2.0. - When will that be? - TBD. Did the police solve the problem with Yes, yes, they did. Yes, they did. Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators. I don't understand why our website needs to have social networking at all. I've to agree with Dwight on that one. It's all about creating a one-stop consumer experience. All right? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music. About the election. All of it is happening in our virtual paper store. And then an older gentleman asks you, "boxers or briefs?" I don't get the big fuss here. I like the site. If I had created a website with this many problems, I'd kill myself. - You've a question, Kelly? - I've a lot of questions. Number one: how dare you? Ryan has done a very good job. And I'm not applauding sarcastically. Think about it. A month ago, nobody would go on this site because we were worried out getting molested or loosing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of these problems will be in the past. You done good, kid. You done good. Well, it has been nice seeing you again, my friend. You too. Oh, Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. Michael, let me go. Let me go, Michael. All right. Do you know many girls in New-York you might wanna hook me up with that might be interested in a guy like me? - Nah. - Nah. - Sorry, man - Well, you tried. But, seriously You should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city. - Unreal. - They sound great. Bye, everyone! Stay real, Scranton, all right? Peace! - Would you have sex with Meredith? - What? - Do you think she'd keep it quiet? - I'm gonna go to my desk. Jim, it's not the horniness, okay? It's the loneliness. That's I know. - Let's go to New-York club with Ryan. - I can't. You can. You're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome. - I'm not single. - Who are you dating? - Pam. - That's still going on? Okay, Dwight, grab your stuff. We're going to New-York, to party with Ryan and to meet girls. - Yeah! - Oh, yes. Count me in, dudes. I am in serious need of some bro'time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately, - if you know what I'm saying. - I'm right here. No, singles only. Singles only. Also three is unlucky. - Curse of three. - Sorry, Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, saturday morning. Probably wearing the same clothes that I'm wearing right now. If you catch my drift. We get it. I am going to go get laid. Good-bye! With sex! You know what? If we stay 2 hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in all tomorrow. So I caught everyone before they left, and I told them my idea. And they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas. The one time a year they hear one. Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative. This place is packed! Fire hazard. Packed with beautiful babies! Swingers. Classic. Jon Favreau, tall guy from Dodgeball. Women look like white slaves. No, they're just hot. Hotties. I don't know. When you think about it, Cabo is really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty, you know? You go there to get some glamour - What are you doin' here? - Well, you know, just taking you up on your offer to party so That is so awesome, man! All right! - And you brought this guy! - Yeah! Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight. I know it's you guys! I'm so psyched you're here. Well All right! - Let's get a drink! - Let's do it! Thanks a lot, guys! Good job! Later. Nice job, everybody. Great work. Did you not tell the security guard we were working late? Nope. I didn't. Then let's go inside and I can call him right now. We can't. I locked the office from the inside when we left. Perfect. You guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in 1 hour, you're both dead. There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "what if you die, Dwight? How will we get into the office?" He said, "if I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks." Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine. This is Troy. - Nice to meet you. - How're you doing? Hi. Dwight. You resemble the Tolkien character. He basically is, man. He's a regular banking wizard. No, no, not a wizard. A hobbit. Model's service's here. Okay All I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour. We don't serve food here. Okay. Then just bring me two cups, one with olives, and another one filled with maraschino cherries. Do you live in a regular-sized house? Yeah, he's a normal guy. He's cool. You really don't have his number? I told you I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number? I might have it in here. Wow, that's great, Toby. It's so random that I have it. Toby, you're the best! When I put it in, I thought it might be a waste of time but it was worth it. Great. It's under here as "security guard - home". Did you not get his name No. It's ringing Anybody have his name, quick? It's Eddie. It's not It's not Eddie. It's Evan or Hank. His name is Hank. No, guys, his name is not Hank, it's Is it Hedgar? Elliot. Is it Elliot? Hey Chief. This is Jim Halpert from where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk. You're the the african-american guy. I mean, you're Who have I got here? Dwight Schrute, man. How're Schrute farms? - Good. - This guy owns his own beet farm. Insane! Well, it's weevil season, but we were prepared. "Weevil" What a crazy word, man. I don't even know what that means? What does that mean? They lay their eggs inside the unripe beetroot, then, come springtime, the babies eat their way out. - Crazy! - Crazy! That's too much for me, man. I'm gonna head to the bathroom. - You've already been several times. - Yeah? - Maybe you got a bladder infection. - I don't know. Maybe. - I'll order you some cranberry juice. - With vodka. You're the best! Do you have powers? Oh, thank you, Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. All right, so Hank is gonna come down here. He's gonna let us all out. He said it should be just under an hour, so We did it. We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas. Sorry, guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's. Neither did I. Jim was supposed to collect it. - Way to go, man. - Now he's never gonna come. By show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? Phyllis I thought about getting a tatoo on my back as well, at one point. I was thinking about getting Back to the Future. "Back" because it's on my back. And "future" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something. You know? And it's my second-favorite movie. I've never heard of that movie. Back to the Future?! Well, you should take a film education course. - How old are you? - 40 I'm in my 40s. That's so cool. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go back to my group now. Oh, okay. - Thanks for the drink. - You're welcome. This place is like a like a sexy preschool. You wanted to meet older women? I would love a place where we can meet older girls. Hell, yeah! I'll hook it up! That's dangerous. Excuse me. Yeah? How did you find each other? We're the Jersey Varsity basketball team. North east regional champs. Amazons! It's off. It's not the dude I know. But some other loser who won't let us in without chicks. - You're kidding. - Let's bail. Wait, wait.

What are you doing, man? It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. Nice try! I've never met anybody who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool. That's one aspect of small pet grooming. What do you do? I am a bank teller. Ryan told me to always tell a woman you work in finance. - Cool. - I think so. Yeah, I have fun. I'm just gonna use the powder room. - All right. - So I'll see you soon. Very perfect. This needs to be shared. She washes dogs! - You doin' it. - I know! I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom. Hey, man Do you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust? And after all the major nations are destroyed, there'll just be tribes in the jungles that rise up and survive? That jungle warfare is gonna rule the world? Yeah, maybe. It's inevitable, right? Please don't pick up. - Hello? - Hank - Is that you? - Yeah. - Still haven't left the house yet, huh? - I'm getting ready to leave. Good. Please hurry. Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks. Will do. I'll stop calling. I am. I am getting out there. Well, no, I've asked a lot of girls to dance, mom. They're just It's not Listen to me for a second. Yes, I shaved the back of my neck. Oh, my god. Mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls! Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow. Why? I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like scrambled egg saturday. More like, "Hey, everyone, let's get your boss laid" saturday. I have an announcement to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home then. - Those girls really welled on you bad. - Why wouldn't they let me dance? Okay, I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital. - Pretty weird. - Do you have to go with them? I do, I have to go. - Stay, please. - Okay, no. I have to go. Good luck against Con-college. Call me. I'm not gonna call her. - I don't wanna go back in. - I know. Here we go. Cleaning people. Oscar? All you need is explain what happened 'cause I think they can help us. Why are you assuming they only speak spanish? I just If they speak spanish. Good evening. We locked ourselves in. Okay? It happens they speak spanish. Lucky us. This is a one time thing. You know that, right? - This is it. - All right! This is where the magic happens. - Nice! - Very nice. One of you can have the sofa, and one of you can have the floor. - I got the sofa. - I got sofa. Dwight, I got up the sofa I'm the boss. - I got floor! - If anybody needs to go to the bathroom I don't wanna get my head stepped up. Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me - when we were sick? - No. - Leave him alone. - It's a lullaby. Ryan? - Why don't you take your clothes off? - No! Guys I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do? I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend, and that you're going to help him, and that everything's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs. And then you get that guy and you flip him. You turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people really, really bad. I've been watching The Wire recently I don't understand a word of it. I wanna sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, okay? Okay. Good night, Ryan. Good night, Ryan. Best night ever. Like I said, it's not about the horniness. It's about the loneliness. And how can I be alone here with my boys? Like a famous person once said, "boys on the side." But I don't I disagree. I say, let's hear it for the boys. Son of a bitch.
Everybody, everybody, listen up. I need your ideas now. Ideas, please, right now. Go, go! - Come on! - What you're talking about? Wet cement outside, it's drying fast. Come on, this is a lifelong dream. What do I write? Michael, you could put your initials in it. M.G.S., no. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't Once in a lifetime opportunity, people. - Come on! - Well Here we go! Phyllis, yes? - When I was a little girl - Okay. Okay, do it! Come on, great, let's hear it! - We found some wet cement - It's drying, it's drying. All right, Phyllis, come on! - Come on, Phyl! - What did we write? Aah! Come on! - Draw a picture. - No! - 'Cause that says so more than words. - No, no! Come on, give me something good! I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the chinese theater, - and, oh, my god, he looked so good. - Pam, translate. She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in cement. - I love it! - A real star would put his face in it. - I love it more! - Michael, that doesn't seem safe I love it! Come on, let's go! We are here today not to immortalize a man, but an idea. Maybe the idea of a man. Hurry, please. Greatness is only skin-deep some people say. Well, that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside and in this case, that's also not true. Go! Force it in as deep as you can. That's what she said. Today's a very special day for me. And it's really not about me. It's about my grandkids. It's about my great-grandkids. I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look, kids. Your daddy left that facehole." I don't know. It's a good feeling. Episode 4x12 "DID I STUTTER" (1.00) Okay Adjective. Tall. No, no, uh, nice. Good one. Okay You ready? "The tall man entered the nice building, "to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith. "Can I interest you in any good cat food?" It's a man eating cat food! What about a cat eating man food? Andy and Angela seem very happy. I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them. Yeah, I slept over at a friend's house, and I forgot my contact solution, so I had to wear my back-up glasses. Shut up. All right, everybody. Oh, my god. Pam Those make you look so ugly. Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction. - I don't have my contact - Blah blah! I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. We're gonna have a little brainstorming session in the conference room. Energize. You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly Don't, don't. If you propose to me during the Michael meeting, I will say no. Well, it's too late, 'cause I'm proposing that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly and make me the happiest man in the world. Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam clearly has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we need to get things going. We need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas what we could do? Any suggestions? Yes, Andy? What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message so it just had a little more zing and a little more pep? Zing and pep. Those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim. What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep? Now we're cooking, I like this. Maybe a whole theme. - Like a rap a rap rhyme. - An urban thing. An urban Yeah, Stanley, you wanna help us out with that? - Stanley! Earth to Stanley. - Not me. Yes, you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down - and join the group. - No. - Stanley, we're having - Leave me alone, damn it. We're having a brainstorm session Did I stutter? Good. This is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water. Can I talk to you a second? What? I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning. What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened. Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate. - That, in the conference room? - Yeah. We were joshing around, the two of us. And he said, "Did I stutter?" And I said, "wh-wh-wh-what, dog?" It was joking, Toby, all right? He didn't seem like he was joking. Well, you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another. "Hey, um, you're poor." "Well, hey, your mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's You're so white. All right. Well If you really believe that Stanley was joking - Why don't we go ask him that? - Okay, I will. I'm not feeling very well right now, though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today. You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school. Well, sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office. So it's probably psychological. You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stop light and look over and there's an Xterra next to you, they're always driven by chicks. So there's your ice breaker. Scratch! That's a racing stripe. - Bumper's sagging. - Hmm, I doubt that very much. This car is crap. I will buy it for next to nothing. - How next to? - Well, here are your options. You can sell it for parts. Drive it off a cliff. You can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or you can sell it to me and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey. - I have to pick one of those? - Yes. - Can you go over those options again? - You know what? You knock $1,500 off the price right now and I will take it off your hands. It's gonna be now. - I have the blue book value - Seal the deal. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one. - Can I think about it? - Five, four, three, two, now. - Let me think about it. - Say it. Do it now. Do it now! Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand. Yeah, all right! What? I see that you gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly. So thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal. What are you talking about? Well, you know, the thing that you said earlier that you didn't mean. And that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned. So we are cool. I am not going to apologize to you. It's like I used to tell my wife. "I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong "and if you don't like it, you can leave." And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too. Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters. Hence the green line. Green for money. Sales, get it? There's this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley. - Great. - However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly. What's the pink? Menstrual cycles. Okay. Is there anybody up here, anybody at all that can deal with this - other than me - You. Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office. - I never said you could do that. - All you have to do is say it. - Okay, I'll think about it. - Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two Do it. Give me control. Michael I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey. This office needs a strong man. Say it. - No. - So All right, well then, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself. Hey, Pam. I really like your glasses. Thanks. All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses. Okay. Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually. - I should probably get back to - Like librarians. - entering the - Could you just say, "These are due back thursday." No. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Okay, go ahead. A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless. - Mike. - Hey. - I'm very busy here, man. - Darryl Have you ever been in a gang? Why? It's an advice question, and if you don't want to talk about it, I completely understand. It's - No, no. - I know it's very personal. No - I have. - I knew it. Okay. Who are we talking about here? - Crips, bloods? - Both. - God. - Yeah, them and the latin kings. - The warriors, Newsies. - Okay. Okay, so dig this. You're on the street and one of your gang disses you. - Oh, my goodness. - Yeah, right. What do you do to get him to make it right? Well, see in the gang world, we use something called fluffy fingers. What is that? That's where if somebody really gets in your face, you know, just start tickling them. - Really? - Yeah. And he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Y'all can just go to church together and get an ice cream cone. I would have never thought that gangs would be tickling each other. Well, it's effective. I think it's self-explanatory. Hey, Jim! Come here for a second. Can you answer me something as a true Eagles fan? Oh, boy. How do you live with a franchise this bad? - On a wing and a prayer mostly. - All right, whatever you say. Listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance. A formal warning? It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here. I know how little you care about your job. And honestly, if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation. I'm sorry, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head. This is nothing to do with that, all right? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it. Then do you mind explaining it a little better? - 'Cause I'm not sure - Don't get all defensive, okay? It's just a warning. If you want details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, all right? I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk and hanging out with Pam has finally caught up to him. P with Pam. Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want? Oh, we were just talking about bureaucratic stuff. Because you're very important. Yeah. Oh, what's Dwight up to? Oh, probably nothing. What the hell is this all about? You're flipping my car for profit. It's my car now. I gave you a deal based on what you said to me. Yeah, well seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on ebay. I've got a mad lib for you. "A stupid idiotic numbskull "named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra "to a smart and capable man named Dwight. "This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight." Okay, everybody, shh! Listen up. Earlier today, Stanley sassed me. And Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They didn't work, obviously, because they were stupid. So I am now going to fake fire him. - What does that mean? - It's like a mock execution. - That's not a good idea. - Yes, it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left. - Well, you can actually fire him. - No - I've had enough of you. - Why are you telling us this? Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay? Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him. I'm not firing him! I will need you to act like I am firing him. Just what I'm going to do is I'm going to pretend that I'm firing him. And I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, all right? That's all I'm Okay, here he comes. Let's just play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second? Stanley Hudson, you are fired. Are you serious? I am serious. We are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack. You're firing me over three words? - Yes. - Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me? I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing - you've ever done up in this office. - All right, okay. You know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice. So I'm not fired. That's it. And do you have anything to say to me? Yes, I do. You are out of your damn little pea-sized mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense at all? Do you have any idea how to run an office? Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before. And I think, "There's no possible way he can top that." But you do you do? You find a way, damn it, to top it. You are a professional idiot Hey, stop it! Okay, everybody out. - Who? - Yeah, everybody except Stanley. Let's go. - I can't find my glasses. - You know what? Take my hand, and leave 'em and let's get out of here. Okay, okay. It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it. I don't understand why you keep picking on me. - Oh, for the love of god. - You just do, and I don't know why, so please help me understand. Fine. Here it is. You are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way. Well, Stanley, maybe you are feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well. Michael, I've know you a very long time. And the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories? All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me. You can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it. Fair enough. I am a good person, and sometimes good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got no respect. My wife likes to talk after sex. So she called me from a hotel room, said, "I don't respect you." Thoughtless. You know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect. Some take her, please, for example. If you don't get no respect, you might be a redneck. Respect is nice. Borat. What's the deal with grape nuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect. So I'm thinking as a reward for our loyal clients that we contact their assistants and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses in the middle of summer and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas celebration and we'll call it, "A summer sales a lot." Feedback, anybody? Stanley? Has the potential to be the best idea yet That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Damn it. All right, everybody out except Phyllis.
Hey. Ready? Come on! Show me excited. - Yes! - Yeah. I'm pretty excited too. Today I'm headed over to the Job Fair at Valley View High School to find some new interns. Wanna get some fresh blood youthanize this place. - We doin' this thing? - Yeah. Oh, my god, Darryl. You look like Barack Obama. Everybody, I'm dating Barack Obama. - Why you dressed like that? - Like what? Like you're applying for a loan. Maybe he's going to church. Or court. Figured I'd look presentable. You went a different way. - You look nice. - Thank you. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No, and also because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. No need to worry with them because they definitely ain't goin' to college. What college did you go to, Mike? Let's go! Today I am meeting a potential client on the golf course because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan. He was the temp here. Yeah. And It is not a good time for me to lose my job since I have some pretty big long-term plans in my personal life with Pam that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before Try. Mr. Maguire. It's been a couple of years. Hey, Jim, how are ya? Nice to see you, man. Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no. My grandfather would be spinning in his urn if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now, or I will take it off for you, sir. I am totally and completely kidding! Andy Bernard. Cornell, '95. Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74. - Got some blisties. - Yeah, you do. Hit about 1,200 balls last night in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful. Let's make it interesting. Say 10 bucks a hole? - Great. - What are we talkin'? Skins? Acey deucy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, barkies, arnies? Wolf? What? I'm gonna take this petty cash that I got from Oscar and turn it into next month's rent. So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days. Little over the top, don't you think? Show 'em what you brought, Mike. - That's all we brought. - This is all we need. - We'll see. - Yes, we will see, Oscar. We will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities. Conceptual. All right. We are open for business. Hello. - Andy, you're up. Let's go. - Giddy-up. Let's do this. People assume I'm great at golf, but like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid, so I used to just hang out with the sailing club instead. Got my knot on. Damn it! Guys, do we have to stay all day? I mean, Michael's gone. Can't we just go? Yeah. And I finished my work months ago. Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention that some of you have forgotten who is in charge here. When Michael is gone, Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone, you answer to me. Okay? Excuse me, where do you think you're going? Oh, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley. Do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will He left. Last time I checked, the american workday ends at 5:00 P.M. You will all stay at your desks until that time or you will suffer the consequences. What consequences? I will tell on you. There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves, replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. We - eat a lot of cake. - Cool. Yeah, and you know, you basically, you learn how an office runs. - Hello. - So Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Excuse me. - This is Michael, my boss. Justin. Hey remember what we talked about in the car on the way out? "Only the best and the brightest"? He's nice, and he seems interested. He's totally wrong, Pam. - Hi. - How you doin'? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you should limit himself. You could do whatever you wanna do. You could be a classy janitor or a cashier with dignity or a migraine worker. Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby. - Sorry for wasting your time. - Oh, no problem. And he signed! He put his name on the piece of Okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams, and he just made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one immediately. Yeah. The booth is lame without it. - I only brought the one. - Are you mental? Michael, do you remember you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure, Michael?" And you said, "Pam, Pam, Pam." And then you sneezed in my tea. And then you said, "Don't worry. It's allergies." Do you remember that? I don't. Okay. I'll go look for another one. And that is why I need a smart intern. So how's the direct mail business going? I can't complain. People love their junk mail. Now, are you gettin' all your paper from PPC, or You know what, Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now. I just came out here to get out of the office, so why don't we just play, okay? Absolutely. Will do. So I guess I'll just work on my short game. Hello, there. What is this company? Well, it's funny that you should ask, because it's really - more than a company. - Dunder Mifflin. Paper. - Thanks. - It Okay Damn it, Oscar! Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth. But kids are very wary of being lured these days. Thank you, dateline. Thank you. - Extension 128. - Hiya, pumpkin. It's Creed. Say we're gonna ditch this bitch You in? - No. - You out? Pumpkin's out! Let's go, gang. My old art room. Oh! Maybe it's still here. No. No, they must have taken it down. Never mind. - What do you want? - Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left except for Angela and I. Do not worry, though. I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day. Who cares? I'm not there, neither's Jim. Why should they have to be there? So what else is up? Mich Thank you! Wha What is this? - Piece of paper. - This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. It's some sort of Pendleton crap. I think they'll get the spirit of it. Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office, and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock. - Are you serious? - Yes. And don't call me Shirley. Okay. Ah, damn it! You could just pick it up, take the triple bogey. Yeah, I I'll get it out. Thank you. Yep. Come on, Tuna! Hey. Can't really talk now. What's up? Just checkin' in. How's it going? You know. We'll see. We'll see. I just drove 20 miles round trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess. Oh, I like you. Talk to you later? Yeah, all right. Bye. All right. I'm sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs? You can try. But I looked at your prices. Even with free shipping doesn't work. It's just it's not in the stars, Jim. Six. - Yeah - All right, race to the next hole! Winner gets ten bucks. Wait wait for me! - Andy! - Shortcut! Shortcut! I fell in the sand trap. All of these jobs suck. I would rather live jobless on a beach somewhere off the money from a large inheritance than to have to work in any one of these crapholes. They suck. Hey. Game over. Justintime. - Hi. - Justincase. - What's your last name? - Polznik. "This just in: "Justin Polznik." Justin is the ugly girl in the movie who takes off her glasses, and she's hot. And you realize that she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses, and that you were the blind one. He's the most important thing in my life right now. I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez, accountant extraordinaire. - This is Justin. - Hey. This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will do you. No. No. But she has already dated two guys in the office that we know of, so this could be number three, you never Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she's a wonderful person - and a gifted artist. - Why wouldn't you say that to her face? So What do you think? Think these guys are nice? Guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor of spending the summer with us at Dunder Mifflin? I think I think you are very special. You didn't want me before. - That's what you said. - No, I didn't. You were you were kind of a jerk to me. I And I'm gonna go now. Why don't Bless you. Thank you. Okay, Jim, you owe me 120. And Phil, you owe me 230. Let's open a tab, 'cause you and me are gonna be playin' more often. - Count me in. - No. All right. Okay. You had some fun and and got paid for it. So let me just get my last shot in there. - Is there anything you can do for me? - I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months. Let's talk then. - Sound good? - Absolutely. Good playing with you guys. You know, it's a tough thing seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap, but I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him that I don't quit either and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after So I am now his paper supplier. And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feelin' pretty good. The Job Fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled. Hold down the fort. I have to do something. Excuse me. If you can hear me, I would like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R block? Come on! I mean, I don't even know what they do. "Frank Regan Funeral Home"? Too much formaldehyde. The Air Force? Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league, you know? That's not what you want. Dunder That Okay. I see security is coming, so I just wanted to say come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work. Anybody? Show of hands? Anybody wanna intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn it. Okay. I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Beers? - You closed it? - I closed it. Yes! - Congratulations to you, sir. - Thank you very much. Appreciate it. - Well done. Nice job. - Thank you. You know what? Screw this. Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself, and I'll never do that again. 'Cause I look at somebody like Jim Halpert, and I think that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here selling paper. Just like me. Yeah. Kiss her. Kiss her good. - Hi. - Hello. I was just wondering what kind of jobs do you guys have? - Are you interested in graphic design? - Yeah. - Can I fill out an application? - Absolutely. Here. Take a seat. I should let you know right away this is just an entry level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like a self-starter, someone who can meet deadlines and just pretty much just go the extra mile. - I can do that. - Great, and Obviously, we're looking for someone who knows Photoshop and Dreamweaver, Corel Painter, Illustrator, After Effects All the basics. I don't know any of those. It's actually not super-complicated. I'm sure there's some sort of, like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious, one thing about New York or Philadelphia They got amazing programs out there for design. - New York or Philadelphia. - Yeah. All right. Cool. Well, thanks. - And I'll look into those. - You should. - New York or Philadelphia. - Absolutely. - That's where the action is. - Thanks.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. - Hello? - Hello, this is Dwight. Hello? Hello? Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second. - Jim what are you doing? - And how many would you like? - Hang that up right now. - I can get that out to you immediately. It's an imposter. Don't do business with him, this is not Dwight Schrute. Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset. Okay, fine, I'll just let it go to voice mail. - Hello, this is Dwight. - Hey, is this Dwight? - Yes, it is. - Oh, my goodness, you sound sexy. Thank you. I've been working out. You're not talking to Dwight right now. You're talking to Jim. Pam, I'm over here. I'm confused. Disconnect that right now. - You give me your earpiece. - I can't do that. Unsanitary. You know what, fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. Done. This is Dwight. And I forwarded his desk phone to mine. Oh, hello, mater. Good news, I've married. Tell fater. Such a nice woman. Episode 4x14 "GOODBYE, TOBY" (1.00) Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came in extra early. So much energy. There are certain days that you know you'll remember the rest of your life. And I just have a feeling that today is one of those days. - Morning. - Mornin'. So here we go. Just a matter of hours now until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm And Good morning, Kelly. I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel? Fine. Good. I feel weird. First thing on the agenda. Actually, the only thing on the agenda is that status of Toby's going away party. We have a buttercream cake and a slide show of Toby. But so far we only have two pictures of him. Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and we need to do something very, very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade, and they have a band. And people party in the streets. Do you mean leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans funeral? If the devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have? - Michael - Like a beach blowout? - Or a toga - No, you know No! - Toga! - You always do this. We have a nice, modest party planned, and you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake, and to develop a few more slides. Although Toby won't be in them. I thought that you might say that. Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for $50. And lately she has been sending me, like, nine or ten checks a year. As Nana starts to But I knew I should be saving it for something. I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. Michael, buy a motorcycle. So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now. I want a party that makes me feel like I'm flying through the air without this ugly weight holding me down. You know? I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around. So how much antigravity potion do you want? No, you know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore. And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating. Phyllis. Can you do this? Yes. - Hi, can I help you? - Hi, yes. I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for Mr. Flenderson. As part of my last day, I'm training the new human resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training one day. So this is H.R. This is your desk. I love the view. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Hey. Hey. What? Guess who just got into the Pratt school of design. No way! What'd I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. - Congrats. - Oh, thank you. I don't know why I doubted it. Because I'm so clearly awesome. Yes. So when do you start? I didn't read it carefully. I just saw "congratulations," and skimmed the list. I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack. Busy morning. So you know, it means I have to go to New York for three months. It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. - It's gonna suck, but it'll be great. - Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great. See how easy that is? I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So the timing's perfect. And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here. Hey, Stanley. I want to introduce you to Toby's replacement. So what do we know about her? Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. Oh, strike one. I hate her already. I hate her too. Why do you hate her? Because she stinks with her ways and her head. You know, Dwight, sometimes I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me. - Would that be such a bad thing? - Yeah, it would. Just have a thought. Have an original thought! Although I will agree that her head is weird. - You know what we need to do? - What? - We need to sell her an elevator pass. - But our elevator doesn't require a Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing. Hi, are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines? - Antigravity machines? - That's right, yeah. What do they do, exactly? They make you feel lighter. Antigravity Antidepressant? I could put you through to someone on that. Okay. Yeah. - Hey, Michael? - Oh, hey, do you still work here? I'd like to introduce you to my replacement. - Come on. - No. I think I'll pass. Michael Scott, this is Holly. - Hi. - Hi, yeah, right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, god, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here. My job is to make the office fun, your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert I'm gonna win. Man, someone doesn't like H.R. Yeah. - What did you do to him? - Nothing. T No, he tortured me with his awfulness. Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Well, look, I'll let you get back to work, but I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott. You can p Michael. Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against human resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider, though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet. - The pleasure is all mine. - Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more - about what you do here. - Any time. What do you do here? Excuse me. What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. What do I do? Really, what do I do here? I should have written it down. "Qua" something. Qua Quar Quibo Qual Quir Quabity. Quabity assuance. No. No, no, no, no. But I'm getting close. Have you been introduced to Kevin? No. Which one's Kevin? He's here on a special work program.

Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? - Was that U2? - Yes. You don't love Holly. - I think I do. - But you just met her. Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was No. It was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears. Oh okay, it doesn't work like that. Well, you're not a romantic. Actually, I think I am, and I've a little bit of experience in office romance. - Oh, really? Like, with who? - Yeah. - We've been through this. - Pam? Yes, we are still dating. And guess what. I took it slow. Yeah, you took it too slow. - Well, we're really happy. - This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me. And that's really sweet. And you can think that, but you don't say that out loud. And you definitely don't say it to her. I don't want her to get away. I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and I remember that. The first time we kissed even was right outside, and Look. All I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really, really well, like I did Right here at work. I was thinking fireworks for the party. What do you think? Oh, boy, I appreciate your help, but I can't Oh, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party. Why would you do that? Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here you go. Really? Well, we all want a good party, right? I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap! - Hey, Kevin. - Hi. Do you need some help? I can't decide what to get. Well, what do you like to eat? Well, I like pretzels, but I really like chips. Well, how much money do you have there? Okay, let's see. This is a button. Okay, you have 75 cents. So that means you could get anything up on the top row. I am totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute and helpful, and she really seems into me. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. I don't know what you got lately, but you know what, I really don't care because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you think I don't care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what I'm not going anywhere. Damn it! Hello, Holly. What are you doing? You don't You don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them, actually. I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair, and that made this up/down lever thing not work. And then I took the whole chair apart, and that is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? I'm gonna sell the movie rights. And the sequel, woman stands at desk and works. So, I have no idea how you How you sit like that. Yoga. Sit on floor and put together chair we will. Yo-da. Pass curvy metal piece you will. So are you in town this weekend?

I did it. - What'd you do? - I talked to her Holly. Just pleasantries. Nothing, you know, not like, do you want kids? Or religion or what side of the bed do you want? Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point. - Okay, so how'd that feel? - It was hard. I wanted to kiss her. Oh, I'm so glad you didn't. Oh, god. Laying a base. - Laying a base. - There you go. There's plenty of base laying left, right? Yeah. Hello, Angela. Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack. Could I get a list of your vendors? - I shredded it. - Why would you do that? Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think? Sorry. What'd you guys do? Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home and come back for the party? Well, we still have to do the exit interview. Yes, we do. I'll let you in on a little secret. I've been looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for 12 years, and I am now his cruise director. And my name is captain Bruisin'. - Thanks, Michael. I didn't expect - Can I just say that of all the idiots in all the idiot villages in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend. - Hello. - Hey! - Hi, good to see you. - You too. I'm just having a little exit interview. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. No, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the bailer? No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job. Okay. - Did you need me to take notes? - Hi, Pam. Stay. Okay. All right. Well then, I will proceed. I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Who do you think you are? I'm Toby. Yeah. Correct. What gives What What gives you the right? I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look? Sure, you know what, that sounds good. I'll take a little looksie. - Here we go. - Thank you. "What would you improve "about Dunder Mifflin?" This place - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I've got some ideas. I'm not asking it, I'm just reading it out loud. Oh, I'd like to hear the answer. Well, let me see. I would I'll kill you. I guess everything's okay. I made it this far, right? What's the point? Why don't you open your present? This might not be what I think that I don't even know's in there 'cause there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which. "Suck on this." - What the hell is that? - Michael What do you mean "Michael"?! That's not even my handwriting. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?! - You did. You made me wrap it. - No! I thought it was over the line. I just You know what that is? You know what that is? That is a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby. - So what is your gift? - My gift is forthcoming, Pam. What is it? I am going to give Toby Your watch? Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that? - I just knew. - How did you know? Oh, that is so sweet. Well That's my watch. Thanks. I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time. Hey, that's good. Hey, it's the kid. Look, look, look. It's the temp. Look. - Oh, my gosh. - It's the temp. - Is that the police? - Yes. This is what happened. Ryan's big project was the web site, which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice. Once as office sales, and once as web site sales. Which's what we refer to in the business as misleading the shareholders. Another good term is fraud. The real crime, I think, was the beard. Oh, my god. Ryan. Oh, my god. I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit and get my hair done. And then be, like, "Hi, Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! "Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. "I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison." Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan? Absolutely. Right to voice mail. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voice mail because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck. What's protocol on this? Well, I normally do nothing, I guess. You shouldn't Michael, are you okay? I'm just worried about my friend. Of course you are. Just I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I have a business to run. I'm cool. No, hey, stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find? Holly is sweet and simple. Like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level. Cool! A bouncy house! Kevin, take your shoes off first. No anti-gravity machine, huh? Sorry, Michael. I don't think they're real. The ferris wheel is pretty cool, though. Look at our parking lot. Yeah, who'd have thought? Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not. Is he? Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in, but impossible to rise up. That's what she A lot of places are like that. I think it's really cool you hired Kevin. Thanks. - You have it? - Almost. Here we go, here we go. Put it in. That that's my car. What are you doing? - What the hell's going on here?! - Nothing you need to know. - There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight! - No, there's not. - Why did you do that? - It was playful hazing. No, there's no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now. And maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you'll see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. She is the best. - Take care of that, all right? - It's not rabid. - Thanks for bringing that up. - Get it out, come on, get it out. I'm really sorry. Michael, thank you so much for saying that. I feel so welcome here. I just Excuse me. Did you see that? Did you see it? Did you see what Well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so sometimes I don't know how to react to when a girl touches me. I like it. Mrs. Vance, we're all out. Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbecue sauce. Okay. Cool. You drive your own car? Yup, this is my car. Do you drive your own car? Yep, just like you. Okay, bye. Bye. I'm really proud of you. All right. Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. You know what? Let's also give a shout out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh? Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? But the real reason that we are here is to say good-bye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter. Song parody writer. I have done things like Beers in heaven. - Classic. - Or Total eclipse of the fart. - Not my favorite, but - I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today.

Look at you! - Are you nauseous? - No. Do you Do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecia or my Accutane? - No, I didn't touch that. - Good. Thank god. 'Cause that's Wow, I'm so happy. I am so deliriously happy. - Why? - Because you're pregnant. And because it obviously happened when we were together, and - I am very proud - Yeah, it did happen when we were together. That's true. But you are not You're not the dad. You cheated on me? - When I specifically asked you not to? - No, I did not I did not cheat on you. I did not. Well okay. Okay. So it's not mine, and it's not somebody else's, so I know the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so I went to a sperm bank. You did? - When we were going out? - Yeah. I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious. - I'd wear two condoms. - I know. You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than mine? No, no, no. It's not just any sperm bank.

If I was 22 and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one. But honestly, I need to make this one count. That's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all of that out onto the table. I'm glad you told me. I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my lamaze class in Allentown. And you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner. I've to think about it. Okay. My whole life, I have known two things. I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand. But now, I think it might be one or the other. Oh, look they're starting. Well, I hope you had fun today. 'Cause you're never ever throwing a party again. Can I have your attention, please? I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and the fireworks going off. My parents are here Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. Damn it! Angela Will you do me the honor Of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? Okay. Into the mike, sweetie. I said okay. She said yes! And the crowd goes wild!

Hey, Jan. Hello, baby! How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. Come on, let's go in. When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he lead us to believe that he was the father by telling us that he was the father.

So listen I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number. Listen, dummy, it's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A g.d. monkey could do it. I don't understand why you can't do it. You do not talk to him like that! But he's an idiot! - He is not an idiot. - Thank you, Holly. He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here. Wait, back up.

She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? Is that she can't find those little colored paperclips I like so much. - Would you help her find 'em, please? - They're on the supply shelf. Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf.

It's Stanley's favorite. Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. I guess I was just in the right place at the right time. How's it going? - It's going well. - Good. I have a crazy idea. What if we did fruit instead of cake? Cake? Who suggested cake? Phyllis. We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while. Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis. What is wrong with these people? They have no will power. I went I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years. Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country? - Shotgun weddings. - That's not what that is. Fright. Being scared to death. - Obesity-caused illnesses. - Obesity-caused illnesses. Thank you. Holly's right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool H.R. initiative That if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. - So how much are we gonna lose? - I would like to lose 65 pounds. Yes! All right. Who else? Angela, can I put you own for 10 pounds? No, my doctor wants me to gain weight. If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How are we gonna do this? Cryogenics. Beer me five. This is how we're gonna do it. I'm asking each of you to lose 5 pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing. All right, I'm taking off. - Booty call. - Nope, just going to see Pam. - Maybe put up some shelves. - Wait a second. I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me. OK, thank you for this. - You want more? - No. I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things. It's not my problem. "A thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. "There has to be a rainbow. - "24-hour veterinarian on call". - That is very important to me. So I have work to do. Just do it. Sweetheart. Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane, in the middle of a snowstorm, on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together. I know I haven't made this easy on you. That's so rude of me. Have you seen, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. Just when I've begun To get myself together You waltz right in the door It's a pretty lame party. Does anyone want to dance? 'Round your little finger Here you come again Collins has pitched a near-perfect game so far. And popped up Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out. Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake. I don't like cake anymore. Why not, dawg? Taste changed. Now all I like is Baklava. Michael, we have a situation. They should not be in that room. - That's so lame they didn't invite us. - You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them. Let's go mini-golfing. Yeah? Could I have a rain check on the mini golf? I actually have a date tonight. It'll probably be a total disaster, but I think you'll have fun because men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time. Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. - Also Kevin. - You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early? Really? That's sweet. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her. Party's over! You are so busted! OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit? - You said fruit, Michael. - And what is that? Cake. You know, we're gonna have to try a little bit harder if we are going to win this thing. Happy birthday, Stanley. It's king of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are. So corporate upped the prize to 5 days. So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off. - What? - Nothing. It's just some of us are taking this really seriously. I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to 3 feet inside of me, And then eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after 3 months, I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico. That wasn't a tapeworm. How's my favorite branch doing? All right. Ronnie was Things were at an all-time sad here. But then I got an email from Ryan that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency, I told them, "I will pay you any amount. "Just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. "I want him. I need him." - And you got a goatee. - I did. Did you get that after you helped me move - and you saw mine? - Yes. Gooo-atee! Fire-ed guy! That's really funny. - Great to see you, Kev. - You too. I'm keeping a list of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list. I wanted to apologize for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself. And now that I've quit the rat race, I realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community. That's great. You're talking about your court-ordered ommunity service? I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean. But he did, right? - All right. - All right. Well, you lost zero pounds. No change. On the brighter side, you gained zero pounds. You know what? I can't do this by myself, people. Kelly and I are the only ones who either passed out or almost passed out. Damn it, I need these 5 days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking? Let's just all try and work harder, OK? No, I want names! This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life. - So how was your date? - 8.5. I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt. But he's cute, right? What's wrong? Close the door. - This is your fault. - No. Your stupid "friend zone." I should've been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty. You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man. Attention! We only have a few weeks left, and most of you are just as fat as the day we began. How much weight have you lost? - I'm hardly the problem. - You're definitely the problem. This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select 3 names, and these 3 people will get liposuction. Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills. Hello, Ryan. You look well. I wanted to say I'm sorry for treating you bad the past couple of years. I was in my mid-twenties, and I was going through a lot of stuff. I think I never really processed 9/11. I want you to know I've changed. - Cool. - We should get a drink later, catch up. Pick me up around 8:00? That is so sweet, But I'm dating Darryl still, and we're, like, crazy in love, so Well, maybe I'll see you around. It's a small office. Hey, Phyllis, do you have a minute? Listen I'm really sorry about what I said before, OK? I was way out of line. Yes, you were. But you know what? I want to make it up to you. There is a surefire sale, but it's a two-men job. Interested? Split the commission? I'll drive. Dieting's only half of it. Saunas. And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym. The dreadmill. Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone will be lunch, actually. But it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider coworkers. My god OK. Everybody just act normal. Don't say anything. What? My ex-girlfriend, she's right behind you. - Really? Where? - Just hide me. No, don't look Was it the age difference? Actually, kind of, yes. I just didn't like eating dinner that early, so Listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends. Are you insane? God, what happened? There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse 5 miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone. And you burned over 1,000 calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. - Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! - You left me in a bad part of town. Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about? You look great. I can definitely see the difference. Phyllis Vance for David Wallace. "Dunder Mifflin wants to make it clear "That Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate. "Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits "or extreme weight-loss strategies "as was clearly stated in the official" Shake! Hello, everybody! - What are you doing? - Fair question. I say, I say, I say, sit down, Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful. It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I'm so glad that I bought instead of rented. Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society. See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but - maybe something's wrong with you. - If it's me, society made me that way. Now I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus-size suit?" Because you're kind of doing Michael Klump. How do you know Michael Klump? It's your "making fun of fat people" character. How dare you! Michael Klump is a celebration of fat people. I think of him as more like a monster. What about, "I say, I say, I say, I sit on you"? No. It goes look. I say, I say, I say, I sit on you! No! You know what? Fat people, are not monsters. Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject? Case in point. Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside, and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, - man. - Vamping. - Why don't you just sit down, please? - I've been sitting all day. We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else. Hey, shaved? - I did. - Why? So in the year 2000, Fungus and even black mold was discovered growing in the cave. Some blame it on the new air conditioning system that was installed. Some on the high-powered lights. Others feel that fungus is due to - Nice. - Quiet, please. - Sorry. - Sorry. Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk 5 miles, which for her, is basically a death march. She should thank me. OK, Phyllis, thank Dwight first. - Why should I have to thank him? - You're right. - Dwight, do it. Just say it, OK? - I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise. Finally! Right? Phyllis, you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat? Let's all clap at Phyllis. Michael Klump wants to remind you that corporate Their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight. But more importantly, what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy and in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Back, back! Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go. I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful? Everything. She's perfect. - I like her nails. - OK, be more specific. I like her finger nails. I like her purple dress. - What about her looks? - Hell of an ass. What else do people like? I wonder what people like about me. Probably my jugs. Kelly, will you just agree to stop this madness and stop trying to kill yourself? I hate dieting. I hate it so much. I hate this worm inside of me! I want you to know Kelly, look at me. I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug. Summer's going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Klump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York, and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer? Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goate-less. We are the goate-less brothers. How was friday night? I had a good time, but it's been 3 days and no call. I even have 2 tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so. He'll call. Oscar, enough with the girl talk please. You guys lost 4 pounds. - Hey! - I say we have a parade. Excellent. Good job. So it turns out tonight is my nephew's tee ball game, and I kind of missed the first three, so You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you. I know. I suck. Yes, you do. - Dwight says hi. - I do not. I do not say hi, Pam! - Now he's saying hi louder. - All right, listen, we're still good for this weekend, right? No tee ball games, recitals, karate tournaments? - Can you got to IM? - OK. What are you writing about me? I'm gonna write you both up for not working. I'm gonna write you up for not working. OK. Well played. Neither of us will write the other up for not working. - Did he call? - I just got off Kendall? I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. - What happened? Did he call? - No. - Really? - No. And you know what? I even got two tickets to see Counting Crows tonight as a surprise. Why do guys not call when they say they're gonna call? I don't know. I always call everybody back right away. But he'll call back, though. Give him to the end of the day. He'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco. Thanks, that's sweet. Anyways, seems like we lost to Utica by only 8 pounds. At least everyone lost weight. That's all that really matters. Wait, could we have till the end of the day? So we're only 8 pounds behind Utica. Now I know it's a stretch, but, we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day - and maybe win this thing after all. - Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. It's gonna be a little toasty in here. A good old-fashioned sweat lodge. Andy Bernard does not lose contests. He wins them. Or he quits them because they're unfair. - Is that healthy food? - Nope. We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly, please? Michael, I just scheduled lunch with a client, - so I might be back a little late. - OK, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in. - OK? - Perfect. I hate to even ask cause you've been so accommodating - about all the wedding stuff - Your wish is my command. Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song? The little drummer boy. Of course! - Really? - Yeah. It's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway, you know? And you know what? The guys already know it, so it's easy breezy. The guys? I didn't tell you? Here Comes Treble, Class of'96 was available for our big day, so I booked 'em. I don't think that And they're collectively my best man. And they're crashing with us for 3 weeks, so - totally works out. - I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band. OK, I hear you, sweetheart. But this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl one, Carl two, Broccoli Rob, Sparerib, Doobie, Lunchbox. Boner Champ. That's me. Pubie Lewis and the News. Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle. Sandwich. These are the best best men a guy could ever hope for. Let's talk about this later. This is not halfway. I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would've been closer, so you have to buy lunch. What are you doing? I just I can't wait. Oh, my god. Pam, will you marry me? Oh, my god! So? Yes! God! Where is Jim? I'm calling it. Guess that's curtains for the yoga guy. - Really? - Yeah. I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing was that he was a complete stupid idiot. Oh, man, I really wanted to see them. - I know. I love Counting Crows. - Look at where my seats were. Really? That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you. - Michael, you don't have to buy them. - No, I do. I want to. Trust me. I really do. All right. Just I want you to just forget about 'em, OK? Case closed. Can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a $60 limit on my ATM, so - Yeah. - Is that good? - What's up, everybody? - What are you smiling about there, smiley pants? - You're late. - Wet tuna! - What's up, Meredith? - Nothing. - You're dripping on me. - Darryl, would you do the honors? - Sorry, guys. - No. I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers. I don't know about anyone else, but it was a good summer for me. I lost 7 pounds. And you know what? I'm just gonna take I went ziplining in my third day in Costa Rica. I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right. I broke my neck. And I've been in the hospital I still haven't seen the beach. It's nice to have visitors.
- Well, I should go. - All right, I'll tell everybody here that you say hi. No, don't. I'm mad at them. Why? What happened? Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement. That they might be off the hook for, because I didn't tell them. What? Why not? I just didn't, you know, want to deal Come on, it won't be that bad. You know what? Here we go. Everybody, just wanted to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged. Hi, everyone! - I thought you were already engaged. - Nope. That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy. - Thank you, Angela. - I got a gift for Pam and Roy. - Do I have to get another one? - Yes. A little close to my engagement there, Tuna. - What's your game here? - To get married. She's not a virgin, you know. - What's going on? - No, nothing. Nothing, Michael. Just saying hi. The tall guy got engaged. - To be married? - Yep. Sorry. Episode 5x02 "Business Ethics" (1.00) Pencils down! Just kidding. Take your time. Today is ethics day. After they finish the quiz, I'm gonna run my first meeting here. It's gonna be in-sane! No, it's not. I have to read from the binder. I got it. I got it. I took you to an intimate restaurant Then to a suggestive movie There's nothing left to talk about Unless it's horizontally Let's get ethical, ethical I wanna get ethical Let's get into ethics Let me hear Dunder Mifflin talk Your body talk Let me hear your body talk Why are you helping her? You're not even dating. She's my friend, and ultimately my strategy is to sort of merge this into a relationship without her even knowing. OK, let's give it up for Miss Holly Flax! Thanks, Michael. Today we're gonna have a business ethics seminar, because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate. And we have a very strict ethics policy, - and that employee has been fired. - Come on! He's right there. He was hired. - Check it out Hired guy. - Nice. OK, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor, season 6? Anyone know Joanna on that show? In New York city, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that Indistinguishable, so OK. Well done. Good speech, Ryan. You're a good guy. Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning. "It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours?" Now some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would've selected "totally agree." I thought "very strongly agree" sounded stronger than "totally agree." Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement. Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. Thank you. "In fact, spending a half hour at the watercooler "during work hours is a form of stealing." - What? - Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over-the-line time-wasters? This meeting. Can't set them up like that. Why is it OK for smokers to take breaks all the time? If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, I'll just take up smoking. I'll do it. Don't care. I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse. Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about. Can we have a moment? Can I talk to you for a second? A lot of good stuff, and you look you look - fantastic. - Michael. What should we be working on while you guys are talking? Do some do some work. People expect a lot from these meetings Laughter, sudden twists, surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan. Well, I just have to get through the binder. - Just you're kind of losing them. - I am? Don't think about the stakes. - It'll freak you out. - OK. Well, Michael makes a really good point. So let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren, and here I am shopping in a supermarket, and I steal a pencil. That's not right. Lauren, enough with the pencils. I have to go over pencils and office supplies. - It's part of the ethics thing. - That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules. I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? Exactly, Andy. I took intro to philosophy twice, no big deal. It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. No, that's not how it works. I would not steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry. OK, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace? Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? - Oscar, come on. - Pass. I will go first. When I discovered Youtube, I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about 1,000 times. What was the dilemma? To tell you or not, and I'm glad I did. I feel very, very good and "catharctic." I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity. Come on. Anybody? Let it fly. Once in a while, I'll take a long lunch. - A siesta. - Time thief. Time thief Fire him. You've really never stolen any company time? Never. You are a thief of joy. Anybody else? Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer. Who hasn't? Good. Good! - What else? - No, I'd like to hear more about that. I once reported oscar to the I.N.S. Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it. - Well, let's keep this party moving on. - I'll go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Myers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill? Well, for the past six years, I've been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and outback steakhouse gift certificates. Jackpot. Meredith, that is serious. I mean, not only is that a conflict of interest, but there's also an exchange of goods. Exchange of steak. Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey? That's crazy. That's crazy talk. The "Merenator", sleeping with suppliers. What time we got? You know what? That's a good place to end it, right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right, what is wrong Who's to say, really, in the end? I mean, because it is unknowable, but let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Get back to work. Great job. I am truly impressed. That You really pulled that one out. Classic, classic meeting. We should celebrate. There are some serious issues with Meredith. I mean, all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself, but Meredith's actions are really over the line. What you gonna do? So, regarding the supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been? Liaisons? You mean meet-ups? I don't know. Once a month for six years, something like that. Meredith, why don't you tell Holly it's not what she thinks, nothing unethical happened, and that you just like to sleep around. Am I in trouble here or something? No. This is just a stupid formality. No, it's not a formality. Now, were these meet-ups, just personal, unrelated to business? No. I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper. There's not a lot of fruit in those looms. For the love of god, we're trying to help you, you stupid bag. What I don't understand is why the steak coupons, I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper? Well, it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, when he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. What's going on here? I thought I had immunity. Well, unfortunately, immunity, or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace. I've never heard of anyone who kept their job after something like this. Well, I'm not quitting. Yawn Four seconds. What are you doing? You had said that you don't do anything personal during work time, so I'm just making sure. Wait a minute. So you're gonna time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. Really? Hey, look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch, everybody. He's ti Personal conversation There is no way that that was One second. Holly-lujah. It's a miracle. You're at your desk. It's mike-raculous. Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good-looking intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. Sounds good. Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch? I already bought this. Your food is no good here, my lady. Sorry. You know what? Let's go out, Dunder Mifflin's treat. Actually, you're not a client, so we'll just split it? Ethical. - So I've gone over corporate policy. - What do you think? What do you think of this place? - It's very nice. - Isn't it? It's kind of business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines? That sounds so warm. In summer. Here too. You know what my favorite season is? Maybe we should talk about Meredith first. Yes. Get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was gonna say. When the leaves change. It's just I think it's the most contemplative of seasons. OK, so I've gone over this, and I've thought about it, and I just don't think there's any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated. Terminator. I'm from the future. Hey, Andy. By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night? No, I did not. Is that any good? Actually not. It is really so-so. I mean, I like all the crazy monsters and stuff, you know, like Klingons and Wookies and all that, but Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight? Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica? You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot-for-shot remake. Really? That's cool. Story's kind of bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian, Who needs to return the ring back to Mordor. It's really That doesn't sound right. I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean What sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money. That's very sweet, but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules. New idea. We don't report at all. We just punish her. We punish her? Tell her, can't have sex for 6 months. I don't think we could enforce that. I don't know. I saw this thing - Like a belt with a key. - A chastity belt. Yeah, it's more of a Underwear garment that has little spikes, like, made of I think sometimes they're made of metal. You know what I'm talking about. You unlock a little door that Down Where you Where you put Where you put the He has not stopped working for a second. At 12:45, he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1:32, he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I've been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today. I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying. No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith, and pretend like the whole thing never happened. Yes. - What am I saying? - Well Busted. I don't I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky, and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated. You have to tolerate a lot when you're part of a family. It's not a family. It's a workplace. I will be honest with you, that car ride did not go well. And that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds? None of your business. So I guess I can assume that was personal. Fine. So maybe you're not completely ethical after all. Yes Maybe I'm not. It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me, and my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know, because in middle school, I was the hall monitor, and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over. Kendall from corporate H.R. is on line 1 and Holly's on her way too. What's the only thing worse than one H.R. Rep? Two H.R. Reps. You get me. Can I sit? I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man. Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted, and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar. And let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar. I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action. I think it's pretty clear it was unethical. From what I can gather, it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest, the company's getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet, I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that. Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company, but I'm just not happy about the way we're getting it. I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training. I understand Cause every other branch has managed to get those. If it's not something you can handle, then that's a different discussion. - No, I can do it. - Good. How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so"? Gently? With a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go because saying it would just make things worse? Probably the funny way. Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me! May I have everyone's attention, please? We need to finish the ethics seminar. - No way, lady. - It's a trap. Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate I gave you the training. - Don't sign anything. - OK, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in 2 minutes, I'm going to kill you. It's a quarter to 5:00, and I have started to gather my things. Get in there right now, or I'm gonna lose it! - Am I getting fired? - Now is really not the time, Meredith. In this next section, we examine the difference between sick days and personal days. Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you from doing your job or can spread to your coworkers. Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible. Thank you, Meredith. This was delicious. Where's the steak sauce? I think we're out. I got some in my minivan somewhere. Wait a second. How does the steak factor in again? I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash. I don't care what she's doing. I hope she just keeps doing it. Amen, just keep the ribs coming.
- Michael? - Yeah. Contractions are coming every 10 minutes. Just remember to keep breathing. - My cervix is ripening. - OK, good. Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through delusion. - Michael! My water's breaking! - OK! OK! What do you do? I get a call from Jan and meet her at the hospital. Right. Highways or surface roads? I take Quincy Ave to Gibson. Gibson is covered in potholes. Car breaks down. Adapt! I checked the route, no potholes It's about adapting to the circumstances. - Andy, would you like to have my baby? - Yes! No. OK, I'm crowning! I'm crowning! All right. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go! - The pressure! The pressure! - Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out! Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision. - Just keep pushing I'm right here. - Hold me! - Cradle my head! - I'm right here! - I'm screaming, I'm screaming! - All right. Just push and breathe. Numb me up. I want anesthesia! - You can't have it. It's too late. - I don't want natural! - You have to just push it out! - OK! Keep simulating. Do you have the Sharpie? - Do you have the Sharpie? - Yes, I do! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize - and no baby snatcher can ever copy. - OK. - Ready? - Yes. It's coming! Here we go! God! What was on that? Butter. Newborns are slippery. Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again. It is going to be the happiest day of my life. Episode 5x03 "Baby Shower" (1.00) Hello ladies, how's my shower going? - Phyllis, did you get the live storks? - No. Damn it, Phyllis! I'm sorry. Damn it, Phyllis It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments? Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&M's with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name "Chevy." That was me. And this is the girl bowl, with M&M's with the name "Astird." - That can't be right. - Michael wrote down "Astird." She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So - Ass turd. - I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this Two bowls of M&M's and some balloons? You know what, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you, a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower? It does not matter to me at all, whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is It's so bizarre and unnatural, but it happens. I'm collecting for the baby shower. - But Phyllis, it's not his baby. - I know, Kevin. Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby? Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake. I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine. What are you doing? Don't talk to them. - Sorry. - Make the party. Don't Make the party, please. Pump it! - So you know Stacy, right? - The one from England. There's no one from England. Katie studied in Ireland. This is Stacy, the one who does the Maira Kalman-style collages. - Right, that style. - So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab. Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in. Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen? No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like 30 sec to finish this and get to DigiPres. So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way. You can't reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box. - No way! - Yes! - That's hilarious? - No, it was horrible! - Jim, she might get arrested. - Who, Stacy? No, Stacy is a boy! Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me? Wait, I gotta go, class starting. OK, I'll ta I'll talk to you later. That was a good story. Who's Sarah Kayacombsen? I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here? It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose. Check it out. Who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby? That's Phyllis. Well It is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert. - Why would that make me a pervert, - Well, it does. - That's me. - That's not you. - Yes it is. - That's mean, come on, that's Ahoy, matey. Ahoy! - So, how you doing? - Good. Listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy. The child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly fat and enormous right now extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. - And I'm treating Ryan the same way. - Of course. I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry. You think my nipples don't get sore too? You think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital? - What do we have here? - This is my baby. Really Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's. So this is Astird. Astrid. Why didn't you call me? You know, labor just kind of started - very suddenly and - I could have helped. Birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there. That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways. You have no idea what I've been through. - No, I don't! - So, let's I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet. Can I hold her? Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler. And with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: - As - trid. trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're gonna know them for the rest of your life. - Well - Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. - Lion King! - Michael, Michael! That's that's too high. I'll take that. Come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop. Are you OK? You seem kind of I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in. Ready to play some games? Let's do it! The baby's already been born. So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them. No, the baby doesn't ruin anything Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do. Who wants to guess when the baby will be born? All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes. - Thank you. That's very sweet. - Whatta we got? We all chipped in and got you this stroller. - Thank you. - She already has a stroller. This is way worse than the stroller she came with. She's got an Orbit, that's a 1200$ stroller. OK, what else? on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. Being good isn't always easy No matter how hard I try When he started sweet-talking to me He'd come and tell me everything is all right He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right. Can I get away again tonight The only one - Hey you! - Hey! You busy? Doing laundry for the first time in like a month. OK, you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, - she's singing Son of a Preacher Man - Can't hear anything, - everyone's just staring at her. - there's like machines going. The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what, she's been singing for the last 20 minutes! I can't hear anything! OK, well you know what, I - just call me later. - OK. I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Great. I washed my lipstick. How well I remember The look that was in his eyes Stealing kisses from me on the sly Taking time to make time Telling me that he's all mine Learning from each other's knowing Looking to see how much we've grown. And the only Don't hit the fence. My child! Don't get stuck on the barbed wire! Playtime is over! So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth. Actually, I had a tub birth. And it was really quite amazing. - You gave birth in a tub? - It's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb. - So you're in the tub with everything? - Yeah, the afterbirth floats. Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach. It's actually really hygienic, Creed. - I'm done. - Me too. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this. - I could have helped. - I know you're sad about this. And I wish that I, but Would it help if you held Astrid for just a little bit? I'm just going to lie down for 2 minutes. I'm exhausted, so Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529. Wake me in 20. I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt shortchanged. - Could you take - Sure. Just for a sec. - Hey guys. - What's up, Mike? I need some advice from one baby daddy to another. You, a baby daddy? I, a baby daddy. When you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby? Hell yeah. You know why? 'Cause that was my baby. - I just saw this baby daddy - You should stop calling yourself "baby daddy". Why, Darryl? Because I'm quote white quote unquote? Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby. Feel connected to his baby over there? It's That's different. - You feel connected to this? - That's not a baby. You want to hold me, to see how you feel? - Could I? - No. I was just catching up on my sleep. I can imagine. - Where's Astrid? - I think she's on a sales call. On a what? More paper! She's just on a coffee break. That's funny. She's with Angela. That's good. Now, I need you to I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready? Look at my finger. Look. - Come on, up here! - Look up here! - Your hand's in it. - What? Sorry. What are you doing? What's going on? - Excuse me. - We're taking a picture. - She's nature's bounty. - You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that? - Michael, I need your help. - I was just going to I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt. Come on. I like to call this the bumper test. - Sure you can't stay a little longer? - No, you know what? I really have to go. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving. You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with? I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk. Thanks, Dwight. You know what? There is There is one more thing that you can do for me. Don't date Holly. That's I hate her. God! Why would you even ask me to I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha All right. Fine. Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. - And I'll see you soon. - All right. You still gonna be mean to me? You wanna go out? Yes. I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly. Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message. Hey, this is Pam. Leave a message. Hey, it's me. It is I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but - You must be out or something. - I'll leave a message. Is it me, or are we just a little off today? I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better. Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues. I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you. Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you? Remember we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer? Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe. You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm headed to my dorm. Not home. Wish you were home. Anyway Anyway I miss you. I miss you.
- Pam, line 3. - OK, thanks. New york, as it turns out, is very expensive. And I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate. Pamela Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week. Miss you, kiddo. Miss you so much. Episode 5x04 "Crime Aid" (1.00) - That was really fun last night. - Yeah, it was nice. I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of put-put golf clubs. That would be great. You need that. - Really? - Yeah, it would help. - I let her win. - No, he didn't. So When can I see you again? Tonight. I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? I don't care. I'm free tonight. Wait. Tonight's no good. Because I am busy taking you out. I just remembered. I can't tonight. - Why? - I'm going out with you. Wait a second. I can't tonight. Tonight's - No more. - All right. Too many times. It's all good. All right, so good. So have a nice day. - Thank you. You too. - You're welcome. In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where You have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me, I'll know for sure. That's for you. And I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. Cause that's what I wrote on your Save-The-Date. You set a date? J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist-Money. K-Money. - What are you making? - A knife. - You're making a knife with a knife? - You got a better way? You wanna talk about it? About what? You know I know. You know they know. I know none of that. And if I did, you'd be the last to know. The mall could be fun. We could go to the food court, get different foods. You could get chicken teriyaki. I could get a hot dog. Some of what we order depends on if we're having sex after. Elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're gonna have sex tonight? Hell yeah. OK, so we do the restaurant thing, and then Then we can do - We'll just do the restaurant first. - Yeah, that's good. Probably get soup or something light. She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism. Presents on your birthday, preventative medicine. - It's nice to learn new things. - I was talking to myself. Just I don't get it. What don't you get? Why is she marrying Andy? Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk. That's really fattening. No, it's lettuce. - It's time to go? - No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour 45 minutes. I'm a crazy 8. - I'm crazy. - You're crazy. Go crazy. I forgot my keys. - Do you need'em? - Yeah, let's go grab them. All right. - After vous. - Thank vous. What? I didn't forget my keys. I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us? Not if we turn these dials all the way down. Now they can't hear us at all. - Good. - We're totally alone. Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000. Great, they stole my laptop. Well, they stole my surge protector. How does that even compare? Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges. Oh my god. What happened? - We were robbed last night. - Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic 7-men job. Security tapes were stolen. Motives, financial. Or possibly vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that is all we have. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. That wasn't us, right? You remembered to lock the doors? No, did you? Michael, I think this is our fault. - Oh, no. - No, my god! My god. So much for sex without consequences. You are such a dork! Shots! So apparently Pam went out last night and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning. - So - I'm not drunk. I'm on minute six of this message. OK, I do not sound like that. - You can take the girl out of Philly. - Scranton. The future mother of my children. I never felt safe here. You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're gonna move to Disney's celebration village in Florida and leave all of this behind. I would very much like that. Consider yourself at home. Get in. Where are we going? I know she loves me. I am sure of it. She practically told me so. Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she picks you, great. If not, you can move on. Are you sure that's gonna work? It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much. Wait, this isn't our floor Dwight. How's everyone doing? My door is always open If anyone wants to talk. I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? Creed Bratton. We're gonna make everything all right. All right? Conference room, 15 minutes. To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction. Where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it Crime Aid. It's like Farm Aid. But instead of farms fighting against aids, it is us fighting against our own poverty. - I think it's a fun idea. - Thank you. We could auction off things that we do for each other, like cleaning or tennis lessons. - My sorority did it all the time. - I'm gonna have to stop you right here. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own? - Move on, Michael. - OK. Come on! Let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people, like in the olden days. So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this? I don't know. It could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or it could be a Bruce Springsteen fan what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy. - There's really something going on. - Do you need us for any of this? Do I? Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets. The boss scored the boss. I think that's pretty boss. He knows how to get things. He got me. Sorry. Twice. Right? Listen to me close cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me. Or you can say goodbye to this. I think you have me confused with another person. I said I was only gonna say it once. You have until 6:14 P.M. - 6:14. - I heard you. Pump it up! Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry, I Declare.

I think you've got your answer. Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan. I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. And you slap like a girl. What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. What's going on with Pam? - She's good, actually. - Yeah? She's in New York. She's at art school. - Really? - Yeah, she's doing really well.

But yeah, those tickets really seemed too good to be true. No. I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.

Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, I said "why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?" He said "I asked you first." I said "first" at the same time he did. And then I said "jinx." And then we never talked about it again, and haven't been back to the conversation, so All right, everybody, I am out of here. - Jim, you are in charge. - I'll walk you out. You're quite a gentleman. You can let people go a couple of min early if you want. All right, we'll see. No. I'm off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two. Good morning, temp. Good morning. Good morning, Dwight. Thought I'd go casual today. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you, Phyllis? That's funny. Take that sweatshirt off! - Hey, buddy. - Andy. Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But you should know those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man. - You probably shouldn't wear them. - No, I get it. I totally understand. And I just want to assure you that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying. Come on, you think you could get into Cornell? Well, if someone who barely out-sells Phyllis can get in, I should be fine. - I'm sitting right here, Dwight. - I meant that as a compliment to you. As well as a slight to Andy. Cornell is a good school. And I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. I have to unpack this weekend, but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets! Mike, you driving every weekend? We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. I love this song. Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive you all night long If you're going my way Hey there. So, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong. Well, he's had a pretty good season so far Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. You're just doing this to screw with me. Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage. I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs big red. Someday we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this. Hey, future baby sis! How are you, Tom? Nice to see you. I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch. Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, "that Pam Beesly, "she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. "She's the best. "The absolute best." OK, so, here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class I took off my ring. And then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it. That's perfect. You know what'd be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend? That would be hilarious. We should totally dog her about being an artist, - never making any money. - That's awesome. Like she basically has a hobby for a job. So, not the ring, then? Not doing the ring, then. I think this is better. This is nice. It's fun. He hates it when we pick on his girlfriends. They came up with that idea really fast. - This trip is longer than I thought. - Yeah, it did look shorter I was having a nightmare. You were sleeping? - You were talking before. - Was I? Really? - Was I saying anything interesting? - Not really. All right, what's the scoop? How far? Four hours. Almost halfway there. - We're only halfway? - Halfway! You know what I want to do? I want to pull over and find a little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast. Next exit isn't for five miles. Let's check there. - Hey, guys. - How are ya? Good to see you. Nice to see you again, Pam. Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long. All right. So now we can sit and get comfortable. There's nothing out here, man. I don't know. I just imagined a hotel right here. A pool over here. Little breakfast place With really good bacon. Just Here we go. Fourth time's a charm. Life's like a road where you just One thing here and the next day back Sometimes you deal with it then you don't Sometimes you do what you want It's out there - Are you crying? - No. - Allergies? - No. - Did Darryl touch you? - What! No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? - What's the matter? - It's not gonna work. - Sure it is. - There's too much distance. It's gonna work. It'll be fine. We've only been dating each other for a few weeks. Listen to me. - I like you so much. - I like you too. - And I've dated almost 4 women last - I've dated 4 guys last year too. No. In like, the last 10 years. I've dated almost 4 women. And you are so far above them it is stupid. Michael, don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be. That's what she said. Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what, I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm going to make this way harder than it needs to be. Take that down. - Excuse me? - Take that down! I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice, gave me a ride home. I seriously doubt anyone from Cornell dated you. It's pronounced "colonel." Highest rank in the military. It's pronounced Cornell! It's the highest rank in the Ivy league. Andy, let's just talk about this man to man - after work. What do you say? - Fine. Good. - Good. - Can we That's big red bear! That's a bobble big red bear! God! If you leave on friday by 5:00, you'll be rolling in at midnight at best. And then sleep in saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again. I will talk to you on the bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way. I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by. Things that I witness on the road. Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend. How long could we keep that up? - Years. - Years? Years of just a few hours every weekend? Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy. - Thank you. - My wish has come true, incidentally. Because you've met me and you are happy. Clever, Mike. So Pam, how much money does an artist make after they leave art school? Not a lot of money in the arts, right? That's not really true. There's a lot to do with an art degree, actually. Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin. That's a little rude. What's your deal? - Just having fun, Jimmy. - Right, Pam? You know what, I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we. go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly. - Don't you think? - I do. Then, don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. What's up? I just thought I'd try you. I'm thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit. - I don't know what I'm gonna do! - Please call me back. - I'm not gonna be OK. - You will. No, I won't. I'm not strong. I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan. Oh, god! - You might be interested - What? Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs or the Do-Re-Migos? Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions, and it looks like I will be conducting your university interview. - That's a conflict of interest. - Yeah. Big one. So should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in? - Interview. - Excellent. When the hourglass strikes 3:00, then in the room whence employees confer. - What? - The conference room. Who are your role models? If I had to put his chances into a percentage, I would say he has none-percent chance. So Dane Cook. Jack Bauer. And Eli Whitney. You're doing great. Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night This is my niece, Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. - And look at her. - Cute. It must be really fun for you and Marcy. She only knows how to play When the saints go marching in. - I love that one. - Yeah, but She doesn't think she's gonna be, like, a career musician, right? Here we go again. What's your deal today? Just saying, how many famous trumpeters can you name, besides Louis Armstrong? - Miles Davis. - One. - Chet something. - Half. - The point is that there are jobs - Dizzy Gillespie. Also good. and hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me trying to get on the Mets. Pete, you couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You play JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit? Just calling it like I see it. I don't know if I'm going to make any money with art. I mean, it's a very competitive field. But I've a professor who says that I've a lot of promise. And if I don't try now, I never will, so Guys, what is going on? We pranked you. It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind. Got you. That was killer. I was so close to blowing it. Let's see how well you know your big red history. Bring it. Who was Cornell's 8th president? - Dale Raymond Corson. - I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Cornell's 7th president was, in fact, James A. Perkins. Comprehension skills sub-par. Interviewing skills sub-par. What are you writing? You can't even give Cornell your full attention. On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell by evaluating their interviewers. Nobody wants that to happen. Well, when they get my evaluation, we'll see if they're interested. Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character. Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process. Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations. Interviewer has suspect motives. Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid. Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth. Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need. I think I have everything I need. You will be hearing from the Cornell Application Department. And you will not be pleased with the result. And your affiliation with Cornell will end completely!  will end completely. That is all, sir. You may go. There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than a lamp. For the record, I wanted to go another direction. Which was way better. Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got? I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look, I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger. - You can hardly see, it's very subtle. - That is good. Thank you. Truthfully, anything would have been better than that prank. Text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family." How about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald? - This is the last of it. - That's mine, actually. - Maybe put it back in the truck. - You're not staying? You know, I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so I'll just ride back with you. - But you want me to put it back. - I'll be down in just a second. So I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl. - Bye. - OK, bye. I know it's hard, Mike. Break-ups hurt. We didn't break up. Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues. That's a really pretty song. No, no, check it out. Look. Wanna do that? That's when you hit me with what's getting you down. No, wait, you You supposed to Never mind. I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet? - Where did you get those? - What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state. I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this. You will. As soon as you visit my new beet farm. You're supposed to cook these, aren't you? Cornell.
Hey, sport. I heard someone got engaged, you dog! God! Nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love! I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pockets to cover his co-pay. Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela. You, Holly. We would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam. - We'd never do that. - So there you go. Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress. So quickly. And you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white. Michael, did you tell your mom yet? Nope. Not yet. - You wouldn't tell your mom? - You love your mom. - I'll call her later. - Let's call her right now. - Call her! Call her! - I don't want to do that. - Call her! - All right, I will call her. She's going to freak out. - Speakerphone! - That's Thanks. - Hello? - Mom, I'm gettin' married. - No, you're not. - Why do you always do that Whenever I'm geing married, you don't believe me. Are you getting married? No I'm not. I'm not getting married. Psych. Episode: 5x06 "Customer Survey" (1.00) So, I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100. And I'm out a fiancee. - Those are customer surveys? - This is all of them. Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy It's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. - What's that doing there? - I'll take care of that for you. Thanks. Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic, customer service rep. And once a year she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's list. Schindler's list parody. That's not appropriate. Those reports affect our bonuses. Which is kind of great for me because, you wouldn't know from looking at her but Pam's a gold digger. New York ain't free. Get back to work. It's the world's tiniest bluetooth. I found it in a japanese gadget store in the Village. I got one for Jim too. - Jim, say something. - Testing, testing. Hello, everybody. We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against 8-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone. - Pam, what do you want in your coffee? - Sprinkle of cinnamon. I should go. All righty, Dwighty, let's see how you did. - Bring it on. - No Sorry. What does it say? Dwight, your feedback is horrible. - That's impossible. - A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful? I sell more paper than anyone. Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes. - Do I look like I am joking? - No, but that's sometimes part of it. If I were joking, you'd be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing? Impossible to say. I can't see myself. You're not. Yo, Tommy Tuna, - Did you get your scores yet? - Nope. I got mine. They were really good. I miss him. - You must be really proud. - Pretty psyched. That's my mug. Sorry. It was just It was right here. Right, well, it's mine, so, if you could pour it out and get another one. Or maybe I could finish the coffee in here. And you could use Snoopy. He's funny. Don't give up Snoopy. That's mine. That is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back. - How can you even be sure? - It has my face on it. Make the face. - No, I don't see it. - Dude, that is my face. What was that? That was Dwight. He seems upset about something. Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? - Yellow or Dijon? - It is more of a spicy brown, actually. - What are you mumbling about? - How was your meeting with Michael? - None of your business. - Was it your scores? These can't be my scores, Jim. For your information - I'm being sabotaged. - Of course. And I'm gonna find that person and punish them. Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers. - You're an idiot. - There's the charm. Jimbo, let's do this thang. That is me. Wish me luck. - No way. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Didn't say anything. - Love you. - Love you too. What do you think I am saying to you? Not talking to you. I caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser! I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work. I found the best "tentist" on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. I got him! Would you be able to do the same design, but, with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous. Come on! - What? - You too? - Did my scores drop a little? - Jim, they are a poopy. Are we even sure that's my file? Yes, I am sure, Jim. - Well, there's gotta be an explanation. - I agree. So let's see what we can find out from reading. "Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant." I think you mean "smug". - Arrogance. - I'm just trying to And there's our smudgeness. I need a decent bonus because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house So that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so Fun surprise. Pam. Sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year. Maybe it's cause you spent whole year flirting with the receptionist. A little bit. Worth it. Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you. Manage you two on a more personal scale. A more micro form of management. - Jim, what is that called? - Microgement. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile, or difficult. - Let's go. - All right, fine. - Hello. - Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin paper company. That's great 'cause I need paper. Excellent, then you are in luck because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything. - This is my lucky day. - Ask him his name. - What's your name, sir? - I am Bill Buttlicker. - Really? That's your real name? - How dare you? My family built this country, by the way! - Be respectful, Dwight. - Yes, Michael. Would you hold on a second? That's my other line. Hello. No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. I'm probably just gonna keep him on line forever and not buy anything. It's up to you to change his mind. Sorry. That was a family emergency. - No, what's wrong? - You know what, that's private. - Boundaries, Dwight. Come on! - I'm sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. - As I was saying, we're having - You'll have to speak a bit louder. - I'm hard of hearing. - He's hard of He's an old man. - As I was saying, right now we are - You're gonna have to talk louder. - Our prices have never been lower. - Son, you have to talk louder. - Never been lower. - Louder, son! Buttlicker, our prices have never been lower! Stop it! That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. - Never yell at a client. - Listen to me, sir. - Here we go. - The 3 words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile, and definitely difficult. - Please, Mr. Buttlicker. - I'm irate right now! Please give me another chance. - Mr. Buttlicker, - Give me the phone! - I've to put you on with my boss. - Well, I should hope so. - Who is this? - Hello, this is Michael Scott, - regional manager. - This is William M. Buttlicker. Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you? Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna buy $1million worth of paper products today. See how it's done? Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. - You're the master. - There is one condition, Michael. You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly. Don't do it, Michael. It's a million-dollar sale. So, it's called the Shangri-La tent. It's two stories, heated, and it has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple. Really tasteful. I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo. Hobos live in trains. Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long. Well, Nana Mim OK, look This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now. OK, fine. You can have your tent, but only if it's in a field. - A hand-plowed field. - Done, and done-er. There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over. Do you have a specific place in mind? But anything within a 5 to 8 mile radius is acceptable. On it! - Get in. - Are you serious? Get in! OK, what are you They might listen to us. They might be listening to us! Who's "they"? Customer service might be monitoring this conversation. - In this car? - Never know, better safe than sorry. What are you thinking here? Who stands to benefit from our downfall? The mob? Maybe NASA. Could be the mob. But then Dunder Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, - and there's little evidence of that. - Is there some evidence? - Cute shoes online. - How many shoes do you need? I don't know. 2? Maybe 3, if one wears out. - How many shoes do you need? - Not talking to you. - Who are you talking to? - Pam. - She's not here, Jim! - No, she's not. I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed and breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms. So I'd like to re-double my order. If you could put me down for Wait. Shut up. I'm sorry? Do you hear that? Hear what? Breathing. Is that you? - Well, I am breathing, yes. - Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. I need paper. - My god, you scared me! - Hear anything interesting? - What are you talking about? - I think you know. You always say that, and I almost never know. What are you up to, girl? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you? - Are you accusing me of something? - Of course. I know you're the mastermind. But you're too stupid to do it by yourself. Easy - Let's head back to the desk. - You can't come into my nook and call me stupid. Maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, people wouldn't give such bad customer reviews. The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved. Get out of my nook! That's what she said! That's what she said! Good one. Sorry about Dwight, by the way. Yeah, he's weird. Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but How are you and Darryl? We're cool. Bye. That was weird. - What was? - Have you ever had a conversation where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath? No, actually. - Did you do something to her? - Don't think so. Well, something's off. Hey, how's things? All right. Livin' in the moment. Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me? I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full-on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it costs. - Can I tell you what else I learned? - Wait, that's pretty weird. - What? - Andy has a mug just like that. Kelly gave them out as party favors. - Remember? You got one. - What party? Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. Crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. - You were, I remember you being there. - I wasn't, but thank you. - Do you know anything about this party? - Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead. I can't be the only one who didn't - Let me see your coffee cup. - No! - Is that it? - No. Why? OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing. I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party. Man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators? - Probably just Kelly. - Obviously. I knew it. - That's what I'm saying. - What? - You were right. - I was I was right. - You were right. You knew it. - I was right. I knew it. - You knew it the whole time, buddy. - I knew it the whole time, buddy! Right, Dwight is loud. I knew it! Kelly the whole time! Let's get her. Dwight, Dwight, let's talk about this. What's going on? - Why don't you tell us. - Nothing's going on. Let me paint you a picture, of a little girl from southern India, who, despite being welcomed into this country, will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit. I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate. What? I don't know what you're talking about. It's the first time I'm hearing about this. Come on! You juked the stats, cupcake. We called about a dozen customers, they all said they gave us great marks. What's going on? I love your tie, Michael. I was raped. You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened. OK, all right. OK, I did it, all right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to, and then didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends. We have our confession. I'm calling security Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know, she's got a point about you. You do have a problem dealing with people. - See? I wasn't lying. - You were lying. - I was lying. - Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us. - I wanna be here when you fire her ass. - I'll call you when it's time. I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. - Can you make yourself cry? - No problem. I think you should do that. Pam Beesly? Hey! What are you doing here? - Who's that? - It's Alex. It's Pam. I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective, let's go. That's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close? I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work. Well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it? That's it, I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear. What's up? I want to take a big leap. And I want to tell you that I think that you should not move back to Scranton. I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you. Why did you come to New York in the first place? Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art too. Right. And that's why I think you should stay here. 'Cause, I mean, you really, you just got here. You know, and you can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. All the opportunity is here. All the whole art scene is in New York. It would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it. Jim's in Scranton. I know, but all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here. Because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway - I will see you tomorrow. - I'll see you tomorrow. Is that the Matsuhashi B400? World's tiniest bluetooth. - May I? - Don't. Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding. No, we haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers. Well, then, why don't you look over some of our materials? While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months, and be at your constant disposal. Please feel free to call or stop by any time of the day or night. Very generous. Well you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands. Thank the good lord. Deal! - What are we talking, price wise? - You already said deal. Pay him whatever he wants. Can't argue with that. You're gonna make us so happy.
Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan, you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy, you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite. Why are you telling us this? I am jetting off on an international business trip. - Where you going? - To Canada. - Where is it? - Canada. My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client. And I have always been intrigued by all things international The women, the pancakes, the Man of Mystery Meredith, I'd like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi. I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. You are now sexy in your culture. Episode: 5x07 "Business Trip" (1.00) T- minus One more week. Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird. One more week! - Do you have your passport? - I have my passport. - Got your per diem? - I have my per diem. I already know what I am going to spend this on. I'm going to buy a sweater. Michael That's for your food. I'll use different money for that. I was happy to send Michael on this trip. He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire and But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November. And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually, better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people. And to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce. Well, I'm just glad you're happy, 'cause, you know, I felt bad. Well, that is all the past. And in terms of nightlife, when you get there, just ask the concierge. They have one of those? Let's do this! - Why do you need three suitcases? - Two are empty for souvenirs. - You have your money belt? - I do. It is right here. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. - I don't want to wear a bra. - Let me help you. Stop it! You want to get robbed in a foreign country? - I wash my hands of this. - OK. Where's my translator? Ici, monsieur. I'm just bidding a bon voyage à la mon petite fiancée. Translation: Good-bye, my petite fiancée. - Be good. - I will try. - Meaning what? - Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid. That's what I'm talking about. That could be you if you hadn't forgotten french. Where is my numbers man? - Here. - There we go! Our town car awaits. - It's just a van. - It's not just a van. I know my way around a van. That is just a van. Dwight, could you get those, please? Welcome to Cribs, the Business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa. - Sweet! - Handed it to me. As I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet. Michael G. Scott, rollin' like a pimp! Take a sip of that. That good? Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar. That's really good. You want one? I can hook you up. - You'll need to keep moving. - Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet, slash flight attendant, and she'll be helping me this morning. We need to keep the aisle clear. - Get back, come on. - All right. Get back to the slums! Oh, boy. Hey, guys. Check it out. My own personal dvd player and 20 movies. Andy brought one, too. Harry and the Hendersons. Keep it down. I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop, too, to share with everybody? No, I'll be ordering my own food. Thank you very much. I'd like to see a menu, please. I'm sorry, there are no meals on flights less than two hours. Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I'm going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it And Look at that. I can't see because I am in a And what would you like to drink? Just checking out where I'm gonna be pretty soon. When Pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension. For you. I'm with Darryl. This looks like where I'll probably do my push-ups every day. Is that supposed to impress me? Not gonna happen. He has hurt me too much and too often and I am in a healthy relationship now. So, I'm not gonna flaunt it, I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed. What are we doing? This is so wrong. This is nice! Move in here. Very sweet. I'll check us in. Very cool! We are gonna find out where the action is, my friend. Where's the concierge? Wallace said there would be one of those. Bingo. Follow moi, bro-sieur. What about a nice sushi place? Maybe a place with a view? Matsuki. That's a good one. You may walk there if you wish or you may take the number 17 bus until 9:00. Other than that, you can take the taxi and the number is right there. I'm blown away by this. This is great. Thank you. One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight? The Huntsman is good. Down here. The financial district. A concierge is the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered. Can't believe this. - Are you sure? - I just talked to my advisor. Failing. - I thought you were good at Flash. - I was. And then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers. It's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek. I have to stay and retake it. That means another 12 weeks. Can you do another 3 months of this? It's not about me. I mean, this is your dream. And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back, you come back the right way. Right? Right. You OK? My cell battery's low, so I have to let you go. - Love you. Bye. - Love you too. Guys. She's sitting there. Engaging wings. I'm probably gonna leave after one drink. Yeah, with a hot slab of canadian bacon in your hand. Excuse me. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. - Good to see you again. - Good to see you. This is my associate from Dunder Mifflin. - Oscar Martinez. - Nice to meet you. Works in accounting. This is concierge Marie. Who works at our hotel. You look how you say, radiant tonight. And it is how you say, a beautiful night. Michael, why? She's foreign. I am For Madame et monsieur. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. - Thank you, Andy. - Thank you! Let me get a picture of you guys. Everybody's going to end up dying someday, and I think it's better to die with some people that you like Like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie Than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with. All right. I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked. How do you even know they're gay? Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island Iced Teas, s'il vous plaît. Bad decision in a glass. I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged whatever. A guy needs intercourse. You will thank me when they spank thee. Don't do this! - You guys like apples? - What? Do you like apples? - Sorry, what - How do you like these apples? All right, on a scale of 1 to 10. How hot is that dude? Is he your boyfriend or something? But he could be yours if you play your cards right. Dude. Leave us alone, right? Gentlemen. - What are you doing? - Dude, you struck out. They're totally stuck-up. Here, drink up. How about this one? It's Christmas Eve and everything is closed, and you need to get some dry cleaning done. What do you do? What do you do? Come on. What do you do? Astro Cleaners on St. James Place is the only place that is open on that day. Unbelievable. - If you don't mind me asking - Anything. You can ask me anything. I'm your wingman. It's just that, I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time. Right-o. How could anyone stand that woman? - What? - What do you see in her? - What do you see in Angela? - What do I see in Angela? I wanna know. I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her. You haven't had sex? Are you guys waiting to get married, or? Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for. - Something's wrong with that woman. - What is wrong with her? I'd like to know. You should call and ask. I'd like to know what's wrong. I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her? Do it. Call her. Oh my god, don't call her Andy. - Don't call her. - Too late. Too late, it's dialing. Now it's ringing. - Hello? - What is wrong with you? - Why won't you do Andy? - What? Oscar wants to know why you won't do me, and I think it's a valid question. - Are you drunk? - This is Andy Bernard. - I know who this is. - I wanna take you to sex school. - What? - Who is that, monkey? Is somebody there? Are you drunk? - I have needs. - We will discuss this later. - Naked. - What? We'll discuss it later naked. I want to see you naked. Do you wanna get some breakfast or something? I'm so tired. - How does everyone know already? - Know what? Pam failed art school. - Doesn't surprise me. - Excuse me? Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions. What? Are there two suns? Come on Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy. I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. It's totally unrealistic. No lines in the parking lot. - That was fun last night. - Yeah, it was. You know, it's true what they say Long Island Iced Teas are way stronger in Canada. - Thanks for trying to hook me up. - You kiddin' me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'Nards. I can't believe we called her up. Totally. Who? I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night. We called Angela? You called her. That was real? I thought I dreamed that. - Oh, god! - All right. Oh, god! So bad. - Morning, Michael. - Are you ready for the meeting? Slept like a baby. - This can't happen again. - This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups? You have to break up with Darryl. I already typed out a text message for you. All you have to do is press "send." I don't know. I mean - it's well-written and all, I just - Has to be done. We'll press "send" together. - My god. He's gonna kill us. - I'd like to see him try. He says it's cool. - He said, "it's cool!" - That's all he wrote? - That's all he wrote. - Can I see it? - Didn't you two date for a long time? - This is like a fairy tale! I'll be honest with you, we've been talking with Catalyst Paper. Their prices are better than yours. Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings. - Everything OK? - Yes. Man, she's so pissed. She's taking us back to first base. What's first base with Angela? I get to kiss her forehead. I had a good time hangin' out this weekend. I had a good time, too. Wingman for life. - W.M.F.L. - Thank you. You up for a chest bump? Bro hug? Back to basics. I like it. I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me. And he's delightful! I just heard you guys made the sale. - Yeah, we locked him up for 2 years. - Good, very good. See, told you. Sounds like somebody had a good trip. No, actually, the trip sucked. - Excuse me? - The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip. - What are you talking about? - I did not like the trip. Well Starting with the airport shuttle, which was basically just a van. And business class, which was basically just coach. - And the hotel which sucked big time. - The hotel? What, M - It was not It sucked. - I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad. And thanks for the tip on the concierge. That was great. That was great. That was - That was a really good choice. - Please, listen for a second. No, David, you listen to me. Why did you send her away? That God! You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that - That was a sucky thing to do, man. - Michael, - sometimes - That was a really sucky thing to do. Sometimes we Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you even though you just tell him off right to his face over the phone That's respect. You did it, man. Day one. Congrats. Thanks, man. I'm coming back the wrong way. It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff. And I missed Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home. And I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. - Got it? - I missed you. I missed you, too. You're back. Good. I need you to make five copies of these. I'm not going inside. All right. First thing in the morning, then. Welcome back. - We're back together again, baby. - We're back. They tried to keep us apart, but they couldn't. It was like destiny. I realized that, for whatever reason, I just couldn't do better than Kelly.
Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue? Brownies, is it? Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No, thanks. I'll stick with my jerky. - Why'd you come in here? - To socialize. And inform. I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on. Much healthier. You taking two? Yeah, but one of them is for Toby. Why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica? - I'm gonna hand it to him right now. - OK, weirdo. Why's that weird? She said she was gonna give it to him right now. She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other. They used to. Toby works here again. Can you imagine? You don't know. I don't know. What? You should probably just meander back there, take a look, see if he's - see if he's back. - Dare I? You know what? I'm going to. For old time's sake. Great practical joke, Jim. Got me to go to the annex. No! God! No, God, please no! Episode: 5x08 "Frame Toby" (1.00) Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid tan. He looks great. Well-rested. He looks worse. Michael, is everyone OK? I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson of H.R. has made a sudden reappearance. I don't understand. Is anyone hurt? Not on the surface. But I can tell people are disturbed, David. You texted me "911. CALL ME!" All in caps. Do you know what 911 means? I learned a while back, that if I don't text 911, people'll not return my calls. But now people always return my calls, because they think that something horrible has happened. What I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire week without knowing a member of your staff was there. I did not want to go back to the annex cause that's where Holly worked, - whom I loved. - Also it's icky back there. That's true. People say it's icky. I have to go. David, wait. Is there no way we can get rid of him? - Not without cause, Michael. - I have cause. It is because I hate him. You have to get along with Toby. - I don't. - Goodbye, Michael. Don't do that. Come on! Do you see this? Disgusting. So, Tunes you still gonna buy your old man's place? I am. Wait. How do you know? I didn't tell you. I was walking by your desk. I saw some emails. I got peepers of an eagle. - That's really not cool. - So, Jim you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in? I guess technically, Kev, you're right. Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parents' house, the house I grew up in. I bought it kind of impulsively. The price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. You can't blame my parents, it was the 70s. And why would you wanna buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling and a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the integrity of the building? She's gonna love it. Right? Would you guys do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam? That'd be great. You haven't told the missus about the castle? You're in for a spanking. Myself and my lady no secrets. Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's romantic. - Thanks, Phyllis. - Where's your place? It's on Linden Ave., by the quarry. Cool beans, man. I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there. Definitely, we should. "To whoever made the microwave mess. "The microwave is a shared kitchen appliance. "By not cleaning it up, you are telling whoever follows "that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out "your disgusting splatter. "Sincerely, disappointed." That is just obnoxious. No kidding. Wait, what? The mess or the note? The note. So holier than thou. I liked it. Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one? The note is way more obnoxious than the mess. "Sincerely, disappointed." Get off your high horse, Richy. Just because someone likes things clean doesn't mean they're rich. They're rich. You wanna see some real high-caliber acting? Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. Great to have you back, man. Seriously. Just a real pleasure to see you again. You're welcome. Missed you as part of our family. Well, that's sweet. I missed you guys too. So, Costa Rica that was Did you have fun? That must have been fun. It was amazing. Really was. Thanks for asking. Beaches were pristine. Nice peaches? Pristine beaches? The whole thing was incredibly cathartic. Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay? It's actually kind of hard to meet people out there. For you. Plus, it was hot. Why didn't you get an air conditioner? Should have gotten an air conditioner for yourself. - Are you all right, Michael? - Yeah, I am. I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend, but that is like trying to be friends with an evil snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Scream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy, and then the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. Learned a lot of lessons from that movie. This is just one of them. OK, just summarize. Fireable offenses include workplace violence and sexual harassment. That's it, perfect. We'll get him to hit on somebody, and then we'll catch him in the act. I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors. Me too. Let's get this started. - What are you doing? - I am the bait. - For what? - Men find me desirable. It's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt. The bait for Toby? For one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait, it would be Jim or Ryan. Or me. Men find me desirable. Sure they do. When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should've written that. Why aren't you as interested in this as me? Totally! Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still? Are you inching away from me? Reach your arms out. I'm always this close. Camptown lady sing this song May I have a moment with Pam, please? I just have to take this call anyway, so His mistress! I'm kidding. Nobody'd ever cheat on you. - You are the complete package. - What do you need? What I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson. I want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me? - Sure. - Good. "Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. "I'm too shy to tell you that I love you." Damn it, Pam. You gave me your word. Guys, that's really inappropriate. What's up? I got some photos from Costa Rica if you wanna see em. Yeah, let's see them. Toby, can I see those? What's the matter? - You scared? - Those are fighting words. I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you. Do you wanna do that? You wanna hit me? You wanna punch me? - Punch him! - I dare you to. Come on. - What's the matter? - Hit him, chicken. Yeah, punch him. Come on, Ryan. Whose side are you on? No, do it. I dare you. Punch him as hard as you possibly can. Not as hard as you can. Just a good, solid punch. - Come on. - I'm not gonna punch you. Are you really not gonna punch him? - No, why would I punch you? - Son of a bitch. Shoulda hit him. Guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man. You were gonna parcel those out through the day? Would you stop it? You haven't done anything helpful all day. There's still one thing we can do to get Toby fired. What's that? Frame him for using drugs. - Frame him? - It's illegal. But everything they do on The Shield is illegal. I've never framed a man before. Have you? I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage. Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes, the ends justify the mean. I've seen you guys around. I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing? I guess you know why I'm here. I need to purchase something. Like a fridge? I wanted to buy some weed from someone. - What? - Grass, weed? What makes you think we'd have weed? I heard you were drug I heard you dealt. Just hold on a second. I'm not wearing a wire, so Why would you even say that? It's gonna be $500. - How much? - $500. It's a good price. It's a steal. How many pounds is that? It's 2 pounds. I'm losing money on this, man, just give me the money. Walk away. I wanna let you know, I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation. I was just back there to make some cup of soup, - the thing is still a huge mess. - I know. Can you believe it? It's crazy. But I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get in there and clean it up. I guess that's why we have a temp. No, trust me. I would just make it worse. How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse? I would find a way. You've seen things clean before though, right? Pam, I am hopeless to that stuff. I forgot Forgot Yes, I repeat: a drug dealer is on the premises of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson, and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon. We received a call. I don't know anything. We were tipped off about a possible narcotic situation. Here? I got this, OK? Hello, officers. Former volunteer sheriff's deputy. I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office. Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave. Those are real cops. Real guns. Wonder what's going on. Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator. - What's this? - Search his things. Could you step away from your desk? - Please step away from your desk. - What's going on? You don't have my permission. They don't need your permission. They've got the company's permission. What are you Why are you doing this? You know what? This is probably a misunderstanding. Don't search my stuff. I have a reasonable right to privacy. Save your whining for the jury there. Let's just cancel this, OK? Did you recently return from a trip to Central America? My God. There was I went to Costa Rica for a few months. That was totally legitimate. - God! - That is not mine. - Turn around please, would you? - What is going on here? I don't know what that is I bet he has nothing to do with that. - That's mine. - No, Michael! It's mine. Some basil. - And salad dressing, I think. - Salad dressing? Yeah, it's Caprese Salad. There's a little bit of mozzarella right there. Are you kidding me? That's my salad. Wait a minute. There's no drugs? Damn it. Come on! I think we got a fake tip. Officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him? You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them? You must feel pretty good about yourself right now. I didn't put Caprese Salad in my drawer. Did you? Since when is it illegal to put Caprese Salad anywhere? The police could have been out there, catching real criminals, instead of here, searching my stuff. Are you kidding me? That's what you're worried about? You're worried about the cop's time. You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face. You said you were leaving, and you made liars out of all of us. - I did leave. - Yes, you did. And then you came back. Which makes you the biggest liar - of the history. - I don't see it that way. You wanna hear a lie? I think you're great. You're my best friend. - I can't do this. - Can't do what? It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me. What are you saying? I broke up with Darryl. That was your choice. Don't put that on me. I'm just going on a little trip. - Can I come? - Not that kind of trip. Going to Thailand with friends from high school. Well, a high school. If I don't do it now, I'll never go. And I'll always resent you for it. You don't want me to resent you? - So you're dumping me? - Let's be adults about this. Let's have sex one more time, and if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing. Do you mind if we make a stop on the way home? - Sure. - Cool. - Your parents' house? - I have a surprise for you. Ready? Close your eyes. And now Open your eyes. I don't get it. I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside. I'll show you inside. So, if you can believe it, I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good. We can put all of the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help the color situation. I'm really sorry about this. I tried to move it, but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess. A lot of art thieves in this neighborhood. This is the master bedroom. But I'm actually not allowed in here, so. I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here. And I was thinking it could be perfect for an art studio. Look I know, I bought this without asking you. It doesn't look great. I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand. It's just I love it. You do? I love it. - Really? - You bought me a house. Oh, my God. You bought me a house! Yeah, I did. Do we have to sleep in your parents' bedroom? No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about. And the clown? I really can't move him. What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come, and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. I have a son, he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Here are our final actual costs for this year. As you can see, we did pretty well. Yes, I can see That we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an 8-year-old? This is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis. - Right there. - There's the "x-axix." You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4,300. We have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget. Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five? Your mommy and daddy give you $10 to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only cost you $9. So you have an extra dollar. So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer I'll be six. And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you $9, 'cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think that it costs $10 to run the stand. So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus. We have to spend that $4,300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget. We should spend this money on a new copier which we desperately need. Break it down in terms of I think I'm getting you. Jarick & Collioure Episode: 5x09 "The Surplus" (1.00) Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar very smartly has discovered an extra $4,300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new Drum roll, please. Can anybody guess? - New chairs? - No. A new copier. Unless everybody can agree on something better? No, please. Please do not do this. Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year. So we all agree to get new chairs then. - Good? - Good. Yeah, he said good. I'm good. Listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine? This is not the time for one of your principled stands. Pam, you make more copies than anyone. Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Let's just decide and agree upon one. I'm with Pam. Chairs. All right, so teams forming. We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon from below. We have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers. You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex. You'll see. I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this. Actually, I'm gonna go with copier. What? Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel a little weird asking her to make copies for me. So I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything. Good for you standing up to Pam like that. The balls on you, man. - So Michael, what do you think? - Why me? You have to make the decision. I swallowed all your ideas. I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end. I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute farms. Yeah, do tell. I mean, like, "156 paces "from the light red mailbox, make a left. "Walk until you hear the bee hive." How could it be more clear? I think Andy makes an excellent point. But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom. We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine. Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench. We're gonna put out stumps. Come on. Let's three-way this little issue and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute farms. How's that for a plan? We're getting married at Schrute farms, no matter what. I have looked at 12 venues. I have lost 8 deposits. And I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit. I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing. I really think you should reconsider. Pam, I really - hate that copier. - Yeah, I know. But I really think you should reconsider. Beesly, are you threatening me? I'm not threatening you. I love you. But you should know you're on very dangerous ground. This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such. - What's that smell? - You're gonna need to be more specific. Manure. Get rid of it. Manure covers up the smell of the slaughter house. Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day? - You want to eat, don't you? - Honey, say something. If we pay extra could you slaughter the entrees the day before? I'll consider it. See? That's how you do it! Making progress here. Darn! There's a hose out back. You were gonna get a new chair and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember? That never happened. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I'm gonna grab some lunch. Wanna come? Really? Absolutely! That would be amazing. You guys going to lunch? Mind if I join? Best lunch ever! - Let's do it. - All right! - Where we going? - I have no idea. So I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. It is so on. Look, I really need this new chair. I mean seriously. How is it possible that in five years, I've had two engagement rings and only one chair? Michael, that is hilarious. - Is somebody making fun of me? - The best! Great food. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. I got you some tiramisu. So no hard feelings. That's cool. Good stuff. - You look really pretty. - Thank you. - You got a second? - I do. Good. - That must've been so fun. - It was fun. We had a good time. Have I told you you look really nice today? Yeah, is that a new tie? No, I got it at TJ Maxx, $4. That is amazing. You think that's good. Check out these pants. - $9. - What? $9. The boys department. Look at the ass. Check out the ass. - No way! - Look at that. I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier. They were. Here's what I was thinking. Everyone sits on a chair every day. But not everyone Sits on a copier. Or even uses the copier every day. - Yeah, right? - Very valid. - That's it. - OK! See you later. Hot tie guy. Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture? I haven't thought of it. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard. I would like a cat. Cats don't make butter. I would like a cow butter sculpture of a cat. It doesn't make any sense. I'm telling - I want a butter sculpture of a cat. - Cow, goat or sheep. What is this? All right. We're all on the same team. Is it Damn, why is that in the kitchen? You might want to consider changing teams because we would We would love to have you. No, copier's great. - I have my copies. - There they are. - And I have my original. - You got it. So suck it. Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. - I hope that's okay. - Oh, thank you, my dear. Wait, Michael. Let me open the door for you. Chivalry is not dead after all. - There he is! - There he is! Good to see you. There's that ass. Don't take it away! I almost choked. Here's another place. It's beautiful. So Why don't we try this out? We'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive. What do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father. You will play Angela, and I'll pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here. Hello, I'm Angela Martin. - And I work with Dwight. - I'm Andy. He doesn't understand a word you're saying. Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only german. Closed society. So now after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So Conrad And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here. Making introductions. Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have now just just some twine for our purposes. You will put the ring on her finger. And then he's going to ask Andy, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply "I do." And he's gonna ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, To which you will reply - I do. - And there we go. That's just about it. Man and wife. - Got a call about a problem up here. - Did somebody call Hank? Thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads. So there's no security problem? You know I hustled up the stairs. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. Yeah, take as many as you want. You know, it's nice and warm up here. So what are we talking about? Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand I know what a surplus is. Okay, good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs. - Is that the copier? - It is, yes. - What? - Just thinking. Let me see a chair. - You can try mine. - There we go. Not much lumbar support. Everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party. On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers. You would not believe what they do. So the copier. Let me finish. Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair. Well, what should I do? - Let me see the copier again. - All right, get out. I thought I knew what I wanted. And then being here with you and the german mennonite minister, it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy. I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything. - What do you mean? - Well, monkey He's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt. He was signing our marriage certificate as a witness. That doesn't count! - Of course it does. - No, it doesn't! It does in the state of Pennsylvania. Mrs. Schrute. We are not married. Take this thing. It's not my fault you don't understand german. I've been telling you to take if for years! Are we We leaving or what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. - I'm stopping now. - Is this why you're calling me? I'm calling I'm sorry. I'm calling because We have a stupid budget surplus and people Everybody wants something different. You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue? I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy. If I were you I'd just return the surplus and take the bonus. The what now? Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings. Like a tip? $645? I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king. We got that going on Tuesday. Sure. No, I can I'll double check that for you. All right, attention everyone. Let me call you right back. I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier is working perfectly. That's the original. Pam, would you stand up for a sec? See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. Offers good support. It is erkel-nomically correct. It's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? They sit in big piles of garbage. Do you think they have copiers? They don't have copiers. They don't even They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point is this. I have seen the light in terms of what we need and it is nothing. - Do you know? - Do I know what? I think you know. - Know what? - Yeah, know what? Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4,300 is? $645. Michael's a genius. - Why did you say dollars? - Because that is how my mind works. What's 15% of 200? Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus. - Wait, what? - You can do that? Michael, what's 394 times 5,912? Let's see. You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the office something it really needs. I don't need $645. I already have $645, more or less. - You're gonna get us a copier then? - Or chairs. This is so, so stupid. And, God That's my phone. - I didn't hear a phone ringing. - To be continued. No, I don't This doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me. Hey, Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. Now I have to take care of a legal issue. Was that hot or what? So what's it gonna be? You have to make a decision. The day is almost done. You've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me. You are a smart guy. You'll do the right thing. - You think it's easy? - It's your job. You know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up and I'm gonna be out in the common area. But you need to decide. Otherwise, I'm taking the bonus. All right? It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline. You know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put them in the room and you just - We're going with the chairs. - What? I figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all. Good work. I'm proud of you. Mother What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory. Truce. Yeah, I guess. Since I won. You did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm gonna need three copies of each of these stapled and collated. Totally kidding. I'm gonna need four.
What is this? Happy holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas. You are so pathetic. How long did this take you? 3 hours? Five minutes, actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping. No such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. I hope it was worth it, 'cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes. I think it'll take you a little bit longer than that. If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my Jarick & Collioure Episode: 5x10 "Moroccan Christmas" I'm sorry, it's the largest one I have. I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. This is the first Christmas party I'm throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is "Night in Morocco." This isn't your grandmother's Christmas party. Unless, of course, she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate. Do I need this invite to get into the party? - Yes. - Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever. You're going to move this for the party? It's not on theme. It's the Nativity scene. All right You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant. And the North African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer. I am not gonna judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas. There is one person who will, though. And she just stuffed him into a drawer. - I need you to get rid of the tree. - But I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be blackmail, it would have to be a formal letter. You brought the new doll collection. These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities, the same as gold or oil. Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. Catch phrase: "My horn can pierce the sky." Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become more desperate, I will sell them at an enormous profit. Isn't that right, princess? - That's the Christmas spirit. - I am punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to give their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? The king had sex with a unicorn? A man with a horn had sex with a royal horse? Is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out. - They are now. - Cool. My horn can pierce the sky This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of splenda. I call it a "One of Everything." - Hit me again! - One more time around the block. I will grant you one wish. I wish you would stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way. Stupid. Everybody knows to ask for 100 more wishes. Dumb. Ange, check it out. There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance Really, Andy? It's Christmas And you're singing about nudity and France. There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all Jim, check that out. What is it? That is vodka, and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an "Orange Vod-juice-ka." That is delicious. I can't believe no one's thought of it. Belly dancing. All right. Thank you so much. My daughter is gonna love this. So glad I could help. Merry Christmas. So this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India. Burnin'. We got a live one! On fire! I'm all right. Sorry. We're back on the 5th. Should we do it then? We cannot do it then. Monthly dental appointment. Soft teeth. What about February 2nd? Would you want to do it on Groundhog Day? - No, I celebrate privately. - That's right. Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly. - It's our Christmas party. - What if we can't do it quickly? What if we can't do it quickly? What if we can't do it? Do you know how to do an intervention? Hey, shut up. Everybody gather up. An intervention, it's sort of hard to describe. But really it's It's a coming together It's a surprise party for people who are who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them, and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop. We're gonna be here for a while, so why don't you make a plate of hummus for everyone? Little triangles of pita toasted on both sides, fanned, so you can easily grab them. - I don't - And napkins. Fanned. - How do you feel? - A little better. I threw up. T.M.I. Fire girl! Too soon. You know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention, and then get back to the party. We're only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. - We cannot ask her to stop drinking. - I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic. I'm not an alcoholic. Obviously you are. Everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic, please raise your hands. - Aye. - The ayes have it. I don't care what everyone thinks. I know I am not an alcoholic. Let's look at this a little bit closer then. Shall we? When I was in college, I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was "Puke." I would chug a fifth of so-co, sneak into a frat party Polish off a few people's empties Some brewskis, some jell-o shots. Do some body shots off myself. Pass out, wake up the next morning, boot, rally, more so-co, head to class. Probably gotten expelled if I'd let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me "Ace." It was totally awesome. I got straight "B"s. They called me "Buzz." Have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind? Sure. Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion - or mark a holiday? - Obviously. Have you ever, under the influence of alcohol, questioned the teachings of the Mormon Church? - Where did you get this? - On a web site. That's not important. We should contact some experts. You don't know what you're doing. One of my employees is undergoing a crisis. And I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job. - Are you texting? - Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag. Alcohol is a drag. Yes. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to. But then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on. If we don't say anything, she's not gonna get any better. There was that one time you bought movie tickets, and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool. That's You didn't You weren't hurt by that. You said affected by it. - Thanks again. - You're welcome. That's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me, right? How does it bother you? Don't you have anything? No. I like Meredith. Actually, I don't care for Meredith. I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family, we believe in a five-fingered intervention. Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching. Who's gonna tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is gonna tell us what you watched on television last night? I am fine. Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do. I know I drink. I like to party. I want you to say "I'm an alcoholic." I'm not an alcoholic! You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you. I was waiting until later to hand out this year's gifts from corporate. I don't think they're appropriate anymore. Please stop making me do these things. Sorry, it's your job. But it's the season of mercy. You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. - Why aren't you wearing the hair net? - I lost it. Fine. Nice. I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction. I do to porn. That is the image, I think we all can agree, is very disgusting. You know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow? What is going to happen when you come in to work and you're dead? I'll stab her in the brain with a wooden stick. There are several ways to kill a zombie. But the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick. Everyone in this room loves you. But mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire, we are not going to help put you out. As fire marshal, I would have to. She is a hazard to the other people of the office. I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn - in a well-ventilated area. - But you need a permit for that. Right, that'll take a couple of weeks. - I can get you one in an hour. - Really? This is over. I agree. I think you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us. Enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who's asking for help. You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But my wishes never come true so I'm not going to wish that on her. A watch would be nice. They've been in there for 45 min. I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. That's a Halwa Shebakia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan. It's great. - What's up? - You take requests? - Sure. - Please stop. 'Cause we're having a Christmas party. I'll be down in a minute. Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? Sure. - We just missed Poor Richard's. - We did? I thought we were going out for a drink. We'll have to go someplace else then, I guess. The Bog? - Cooper's, Kelly's - We could go there, sure. Brixx's, Carmen's - The Fort, Andy Gavin's? - I have a new place. It must have just opened up. Recently. Enough of this Christmas crap. Let's get some party music. There you go. That's good. - That's better. - Party girls. Hey, Sasha, it's daddy. Have you ever heard of this doll, Princess Unicorn? No, I'm just curious if you heard of it. This is great. My ex-wife's gonna be so pissed. For once, daddy's gonna be a hero. I'd like to buy one of your dolls. That's my last one. I was gonna buy that doll. I was gonna get the doll. - Not my problem. - But I I promised my daughter. Darryl, look I need the doll. I need the doll. I'm begging you. I need it more than anything in the world. I need this doll. Darryl, I need this doll. Don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for 400. I only have 200. You can owe me. I know, right? Merry Christmas. She's gonna Something wrong with the doll? It's even It's even better than the one I wanted. Sunrise Rehab? I told you no! There is no way! No way! It's all right. We're doing this for your own good. Come on. - This is gonna be good. - No way. I told you. We talked about this. There is absolutely no way! - I am not going in there! - Yes, you are. Wait a minute, wait a minute! - Just wait. Just wait. - Calm down. Come on. There is no way! Here's the door. Let's start meeting. This man is crazy. - Can I help you? - I have a deposit. Alcoholic. So do I sign? I need you to put the Christmas tree back up. It's outside. I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be. Shut up. Excuse me? I'm not moving the tree. Face it, the only power you have over me is this little secret that I know you're not gonna tell. You wanna know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree. Angela's having sex with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party. Don't look so surprised. - I knew it. - You did not. - I knew some of it. - Everyone knew some of it. It's Christmas. You knew it. - I knew it. - She knew it. As it turns out, you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. And they have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. I think I can do it. I did it with Jan. All right, everybody's still here. Perfect. Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you some Christmas cheer. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Tis the season to be jolly Don we now our gay apparel Troll the little old Yuletide carol I think I'd like to go home now. Sure. Tough room. Come on, I just learned it. Just so you know, protocol is a little round of applause. But Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. I'm sorry. He's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail? Eat that, Carl Lewis! Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard. Wow, 13! No, there was wind. - I was just jogging. - There was wind. - I want a do-over. - It's not your turn. Oscar, go ahead. I want another try. Here we go! - There was a car. - I was ahead of the car. - 31 is my new number. - 31 is humanly impossible. Go, Oscar. - That's impossible. - Beat it. Jarick & Collioure Episode 5x11 "The Duel" Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by Chief Financial Officer David Wallace. He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so Probably bad. Quick announcement. New year, new candy. Be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy. Hot tamales. So maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more. Excuse me, everyone. Can I have the floor please? This is insanely awkward. It's kind of a elephant in the room, so I'll just No one has rsvp'd to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday. Wait, you still don't know - Nothing. - You still don't - What are you doing? - How about we just I just have to talk to you for a second. No, no one has rsvp'd, and I don't understand it. Now you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you. No, what I'm saying Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. It's been 17 days. Eventually he'll figure it out. When their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just awkward. How can he still not know? - We can't figure that out. - I can't take it anymore. - You can't take what? - I am telling Andy. No, you can't. It shouldn't come from you. - Who should it come from then? - Angela. Are you still having intercourse with her? What is wrong with you? She is engaged. Did you ever have intercourse in this office? Are you serious? Where? Where? Where, Dwight? Seems like you already know where. Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top. I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it - and stopped right away. - That's enough. Because I wouldn't want an innocent person who doesn't know anything about the form What? That was good. It's just at the end, you weren't saying something that could apply to the form. How about "I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form." There you go. That cannot be true! You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? No, what I'm saying is I want to cut it myself. Trade seats with me. I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything. Please stop. I need a soup spoon. Rule 17. Don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are 40 rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. Learn your rules You better learn your rules If you don't You'll be eaten in your sleep - What is it? - You've got to tell Andy about us. That is a terrible idea. One of your worst. Then we don't have to hide anymore. - You're expanding on your worst idea. - Do you love me or not? I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it? Because you're engaged to Andy. Well? Not yet. When? When what? When what? You know this can't go on. - What can't go on? - We have to put an end to this. - Seems like - Come on.  you guys should be hearing what I'm saying. This is really not how this is supposed to happen. Angela said she was gonna tell him. She's just not ready. - When will she be? - I don't know. Is she crazy in bed? - Stop. What? Listen. - How so, specifically? - This shouldn't happen at work. - Eager and flexible. This shouldn't be coming from his boss. We should also consider the fact - that man has an anger issue. - Too late. - You haven't done anything. - I am already walking. Michael, once this gets out - I don't know how it's gonna go down. - What does that mean? Might get ugly. This has to get out so we can all deal with it. But you're leaving. Have a good trip. Walk with me. Will do, boss man. I do not have much time car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind that when I say say these things that are bad things that you hear in your ears this is something that I if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear. You're not making any sense. No, I'm not. I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. - Another day. - All righty. Which shall be fine. I'm off. Have a good meeting. Kick Wallace's ass. Okay, I will. Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so. I can't hear you through the glass. Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know. - What? - All right. See you later. Are you serious? I knew something bad was gonna happen today. - You said that yesterday. - My neighbor got murdered. - What are you standing for? - If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin. You're not gonna do anything. If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to. I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit I need to talk to you. We can talk right here. I need to talk to you in private. - We're not listening. - Let's go to the conference room. Is it true? - What have you heard? - That you're sleeping with Dwight. - That doesn't sound like me. - Is it true? I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And all that stuff with our wedding cake Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight? A little bit. - How long has it been going on? - I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed Sprinkles. And then we stopped, and I don't know exactly when we started up again. - Who else knows about it? - Michael. Who else? Let me think about it. Come on! So listen, Michael. Your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Outperforming last year, in fact. And I don't know exactly how to put this But what are you doing right? Right? Utica, Albany All the other branches are struggling. But your branch is reporting strong numbers. You're not our most traditional guy, but clearly something you are doing is right and I need to get a sense of what that is. David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have, and I always will. Don't ever for any reason do anything to anyone for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter where or who, or who you are with or where you are going, or or where you've been Ever For any reason whatsoever. Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation. This is gonna sound sort of high maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler. Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really a time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time. What say we order up some pasta? What say we do. Standard, you know? Nothing fancy. - So, like, missionary? - I said nothing fancy. Do you love him? I love you. Why should I believe that? We are at a crossroads here. We can give in to what people're saying, that we're not good together Who says that? Or we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong. Where's Dwight? You okay, man? Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying to my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time. You are welcome. It's over. - Good. She broke up with you. - No. It's over between you two. No way. I am not giving up. - You have to. - No, I don't. She doesn't love you. She's marrying me. I don't know about that because she certainly seems to enjoy to enjoy making lovemaking with me. Angela Bernard. Will never be her name. It will be her name, and you will have to call her that. I don't think so. Guys, why don't we just cool off a bit? - I'm telling you to back down. - I will never back down. - Then I'll make you. - How are you gonna do that? Through the use of force. That is very general and does not scare me in the slightest. I will fight you. Okay, fine! Good! A duel. The winner gets Angela. - Fine! - This is nuts. What is your weapon? - That's enough because - This is none of your business. It is my business when it happens at work. Guess what, not happening at work. - We're gonna do it outside. - Outside of work. None of your business then. - Good. So what weapon? - My bare hands. That is stupid. I will use a sword, and I will cut off your bare hands. Then I'll get something too. I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder. Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now. I will respect the results of the duel. - Of course you will. - I call loser. I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot. I will also be taking my break at the exact same time and in the same location. What a coincidence. So I either get more involved or I take a sick day Leaving Dwight in charge. How'd that get there? There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table. So I was in the office, and I look over to our accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin? "Is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes, it is a tweed jacket." And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need "The need for tweed." It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, but I appreciate you trying. And thanks for coming in. Have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me. Finish up. Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out! I can't believe they're gonna fight over me. I guess people have fewer choices as they get older. Come on! Has anything happened yet? It's 4:10. I don't think he's gonna show. Come on, man. Believe in something. Come on, coward! Where are you? Where "From the desk of Andrew Bernard." A note. Pathetic. "Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. "How are you? I am well. "You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. "It's come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested." True. "The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing "is my soft underbelly." There's andy. He's in his car. - You guys, what is he doing? - Why isn't Dwight turning around? The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. - He deserves the win. - "At last, after much consideration" - My God! - What's happening? Andy's running over Dwight with his car. What are you Come on! - You give up? - Never! Get out and face me like a man! I'm a man. I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiancee! You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! All you do is dress fancy and sing! What does that mean? You can't even protect her! Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton? Last year, idiot! Are your legs broken? My right one's falling asleep a little bit. - Andy, are you all right? - Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this. Back off. This isn't your fight. How much is this gonna cost? What? Trust fund'll take care of that. What did you say? I couldn't hear you. I said What? You stupid idiot! You're like a sasquatch. You live in the woods. Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a sasquatch. How could she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice? - What? - What? - She's sleeping with you? - I'm her fiance. She said she was only sleeping with me. Yes, hi. My last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R N-A-R-D. The one shaped like a sailboat. That's the one. Thank you. What a day! I thought I was gonna get chewed out. But hold on! Here's an attaboy for you. What? Roller-coaster ride. Roller-coaster. Just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.
What's this? Looks like a red wire. That wasn't here before. It's a computer, Dwight. I mean, computers have wires. Yours doesn't. Doesn't it? It's going in a different direction than the other wires. I'm really busy. I can't talk about this anymore. - Just shut up, Phyllis. - Get outta here. What are you doing? I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. Crazy. What a deal. He'll be fine. I made it up there. Proofreading: So. & Valpi Episode 5x12 "Prince Family Paper" What you talking about, Wallace? Hi, Michael. How are you? - I'm well. How are you? - Very good. So, listen, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job. Have you not? Correct, and I was wondering if I could get you to do the fieldwork that would normally go to the supervisor. OK, there's an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook where we've never done any business. There's a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we've been talking about going after their market. So I was hoping you could do some fact-finding for me. I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for. Fax? Why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur? This is important, Michael. Then e-mail it, David. - You've got no taste, Stanley Hudson. - I do. - What are you talking about? - Some actress. Whether she's hot. - Who's the gal in question? - Hilary Swank. - Not at all. - She's got mean eyes. - Have you seen her with her bangs? - She looks like a monster. She is a beautiful movie star. So, maybe we should just go to work. - She is an amazing actress. - But that's not the question. - She's not hot. - Thank you, Phyllis. Why don't we just put this to a vote? Then we'll be done with it. - I'm not voting. - No one cares. Who thinks that Hilary Swank is hot, raise your hand. And who thinks that Hilary Swank is not hot, raise your hands. Five. Five to five. - Thank you, accounting department. - So what do we do now? What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her to get their secrets? - I will seduce her. - No, I wanna seduce her. - Let me seduce her. Michael, please - No I got it. - You'll fall in love with her. - Yeah. So what if I did? That would take precedence, and I would expect your support. Let's go over the plan again. I'm a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies. - Your fictious name? - Michael Scarn. I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries. Then we meet at Denny's, and we compare notes. No, I never said Denny's. Ihop. No, I said Denny's. You know how I feel about Ihop. - Don't start. - Are you a socialist? I don't want to get into this debate again. - I enjoy Ihop. - I'll have a cup of coffee. You will have pancakes, and you'll like it. - The store next to them is for lease. - So what? It means they're not expanding. Maybe they're shrinking. They could be shrinking. Because the sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved. It's lunchtime. But no sign of anyone coming in or out, which means they're not taking new customers out to lunch. They're not acquiring new business. So once again, no growth. And there are clouds. Clouds in the sky. That means it's gonna rain. Bad for business. It would if they were altocumulus, not cirrostratus. Why do you OK. - Whatever. Shut up. - Get your clouds right. You go in now, I'm gonna go in in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. We're gonna need a signal to bolt outta there in case there is danger. And that signal is Lick your lips. Try it. No, like this. Good. Ready to do this? All right. Here come the sharks. In nature, there's something called the food chain. It is where the shark eats the little shark, and the little shark eats the littler shark. And so on until you get down to the single-cell shark. So now, replace sharks with paper companies. And that is all you need to know about business. How can I help you? My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner, and I would like to find out about your company. Please come in. - What kind of business are you in? - We're a law firm. I assume your primary paper needs are stationery, general office. I'll be honest with you about something. Where I used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients, and I just didn't feel like a priority. So, I guess my question to you would be, how many clients do you have? - About 80. - Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation. It's just me, my wife and my son. So when When did you set up shop? I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam. Vietnam. I hear it's lovely. Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic. - Hilary Swank is attractive. - Hot. The debate is whether she's hot. What difference? Attractive, hot We're talking about the same thing here. Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting. OK! T.M.I. So even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock? You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer. That is because I am a genius. Really? Well, about some things. And other things, I'm just I'm very stupid. Like watch this. Is this the cup? Is this the cup? Is this what I drink out of? Laughter is my job. Tears are my game. Law is my profession. I'd like to apply for a job. I'm afraid we're not hiring right now. Why don't you just get rid of this guy? That's my son. I'm your son now. You can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute. I'm a paper salesman at a second-tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there, and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what? - 40 high-volume clients? - Try 80. I've got 90 clients myself. Better look out. Someone might run you out of business. I sure hope not. Me too. I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures. We don't really see them as real, so therefore, we don't judge them as real people. Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture. - Come on. - Shut up, Kevin. But he's making all these fancy - It's a gut thing. - That's fair. Kev, do me a favor. Why don't you close your eyes? Now imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real. She walks over to you and she says, "Kevin Malone, "I just read your online profile "and there's nothing I'd rather do than make out with you right now." Now you tell me something Is she hot? Does that end the debate? Or What are you doing? It's "is she hot?", not "would you do her?" Respect the game. This close. So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin? My boss. Do tell. His insensitivity could border on the cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs of his underlings. - He's way - How's the interview going? - Very well. - Don't blow it. Linda, can I get a picture of you? - You want a picture of me? - I would. Could you just stand right over here? That would be great. Just something to remember the trip by. Just a little to your left. There you go. Good. - Perfect. - Can I have a copy of that? Grandma, I can't do this. What's going on? Little homework over here? - Let's see if I can help. - Right there. Math. That's not so hard. There are four of these. Ignore the parenthesis, right? Why is this little two so small? It's weird. You just don't Just go by the "x." The "x" means "times." So that means four times x-two. What is double four? - Eight. - Right. Excellent. Way to go. Nice. Don't put that. Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I kept expecting a second plot twist where we found out that Hilary Swank actually was a boy. I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, and I don't even get the discussion. Hot is a temperature, people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said. So, yes She's hot. She's hot as heck. She's a female Boris Becker. Nice. Thank you very much for all of your help. Going to be an incredibly hard decision. Wait. Let me get something for you here. Here's some some references. Our top clients. You call any of them, I trust you'll hear some good things. - All right, thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me, sir. I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you. Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time. I cannot wait to contact your clients. I look forward to getting your calls. Bye now. So long. We struck the mother lode! - Come on! - Wallace is gonna freak! He is going to absolutely freak. Someone's looking out the window. Go. Peel out. Go! Shoot. - We You drove over the thing. - I know. - God, what was that? - That's not good. Come on. She's hot. OK? Because if you are saying that Hilary Swank isn't hot, then you're saying I'm not hot, because, obviously, I'm not as hot as Hilary Swank. Darn it. - Come on. - Man. - My car! - Are you all right? - Not good. - Is everyone OK? - It sounded bad. - We're fine. We're fine. You folks have done enough already. You've done more than you could possibly know. Dwight, just shut We're just gonna call a tow truck. A tow truck is gonna charge you - Let me take a look. - No, you know He drove over the divider and then backed over it. It caused I'll be right back. I'm just gonna grab my tool box. Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full Internet access. Wait, what? See that? The obvious symmetry of the face. It's the natural appeal of the scientific standard of koinophilia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she's attractive, but she is not hot. How much longer is this gonna take? Let me give you some money for this. No, I sit all day. It's nice working with my hands. Coffee. That's too much nice. You're welcome. Disgusting. What is this, instant? That ought to do it. It's all better. Gosh, well, so long. - That looks great. - Drive safe. Look forward to hearing from you about that job application. Good-bye, Prince Family. Should be called the Sucker Family. "Here you go, shark. "Let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth, "while I'm at it." Suckers. I'm just saying All I'm saying is Kevin's not necessarily a feminist. What will happen to that family if I call Wallace and give him this information? It's simple. Wallace would use that information to destroy them. Our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine. - Could be better. - Why don't we live and let live? - Live and let live. - I'm not familiar with that. It's a James Bond It doesn't make any sense. Of course, I'm alive. - I'm not going to make this call. - Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour her cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a racoon devour a squirrel? My heart says no. Your heart is a wonderful thing. But it makes some terrible decisions. That's true. - That's true. - Gosh. It has gone down the wrong path many, many times. Jan, Ryan Save your heart for love and use your brain for business. Right? If we don't do this to Prince Paper, then someone else will. Or worse yet someone else will do it to us. I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got, what? And my family history says I have less. Now the old Stanley Hudson would have found something to complain about with this actress. But that's no way to live life. Look at this healthy, sexy, pretty, strong young woman. Come on. She is hot. And it was a terrible war. So many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died. You're right. You are right. I will call Wallace, and I will give him the customer list. And I will give him all of my info. You are doing the right thing. Good. So - Where are you going? - Just something I have to do first. - Where are you taking the client list? - Someplace safe where it can't hurt anyone. Michael, get back here! Don't do this! Shoot. Freeze. Stop. Give me the list! - I can't let you do this. - Those people will be ruined! It's business! It's not personal! Give it! Dwight, give it! We can't do this! Those people It's over, Michael. It's over. I'm not a shark. OK, time for the final vote. All those in favor of the resolution, "Hilary Swank is hot"? And all those opposed. - It's just ridiculous. - That's the thing. People just got entrenched in the view they had in the first place. I can tell when I was talking, you were not listening. This is great stuff, Michael. You are a titan of industry, pal. Good work. I'll be in touch. Thanks, buddy. Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy? I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's why I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even What's the point of that? Why not just sweet? I mean, who are you helping? - What is this? - Hilary Swank. She's hot. Damn it!

Something that dwight doesn't like. Peta. Michael, you have to take Responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack. He could have died because of the Way you're allowing your office to run. Do you want that on your conscience? Do you? - michael. - you talking to me? Yeah. What?

Welcome back, stanley. Thank you, michael. It's true. Around this office, in the past, i Have been a little abrupt with people. Not maybe. Yes or no. No way. Uh-uh. Are you from another planet?

We found ourselves on the Less-prepared side of things When stanley had his When his heart went berserk. And i knew exactly what to do, But in a much moreeal sense, I had no idea what to do. So i thought we should Have a cpr training class. And course you can't get the practice dummy Unless the instructor comes along with it. Red cross, you know, racket. I can't keep doing this forever. It's been 20 seconds. Call it. Would you like to try next? Absolutely i would not. You know who i really think should go? Stanley. Oh, i don't know. That's not a good idea, Michael. He needs to rest. No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there To coddle your heart back When it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by Yourself and your heart stops? I would die. And you're okay with that? I'm okay with the logic of it. Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this. Yes, i had a heart attack. I would quit, but i'm too Old to find another job.

I mean, what kind of quality Of life do we have there? I would want to live with no legs. How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how You exist right now, kevin. You don't do anything. All right, well, let's get back To it.'cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone we need to pump at a Pace of 100 beats per minute. Okay, that's, uh, hard to keep track.

My goal is to make this office as peaceful A place for stanley hudson as i can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. That one makes me think Of death. That's kind of nice. It is a beautiful, sunny day As we walk through the meadow. It is very spiritual and relaxing, And there are flowers, and It is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle in the distance. Don't open your eyes. What? Ohh. And you walk up toward the castle, And inside the castle are four men. And each of them-- none Of them have shoes. And they give you a funny cigarette, And you feel even more relaxed. And then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. So what kind of ice cream do you want? Yell it out. Chunky monkey. - too expensive. - chocolate. Racism is dead,stanley. You can have any kind Of ice cream you want. What do you want? What is that? People. Please,i told you to get Rid of the cell phones. It's my biofeedback machine. Oh,okay. What is that? Like a video game? It alerts me when my Stress level goes up So i can try to calm down. You have stress? Yes. During our relaxation exercise? Let me get you some water. No,no,i'll help you.  I'll help you up. - here we go. Here we go. - no,michael. - let me get you up. - would you step back?Please. - okay. All right. - please. - a little further. - okay. I think that thing is on the fritz. Oscar. Would you reach over And touch his thing? That's what he said. Right,guys? 'Cause of gay. Let's give this a shot. Hello-- Michael,i think you're what's Stressing everybody out. So it wasn't dwight after all. Looks like i am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer. It's a great twist. Great twist. Dunder mifflin,this is pam. Oh. Hey,mom. No. What did dad say? What did you say to mdad? What? After you talked,he called my mom And said he was gonna Look for an apartment. Oh,my god. Pam,i don't kno I--nothing. Truly,nothing. I mean,i--i just was honest With him and i-- I'm so sorry,i--i don't know. I'll call him again. So It was her parents or my parents. What could jim have said To make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage Is he gonna say it to me? I don't get it. Do i stress you out? Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the Approval of mynferiors. Speaking of which-- Remember when people used to say "boss" When they were describing Something that was really cool? Like "those shoulder pads Are really boss,man." "look at that perm. That perm is so boss." It's what made me want To become a boss. And i looked so good in A perm and shoulder pads. But now,boss is just slang Fo"jerk in charge." Okay,everybody. I figured it out. The reason that you are all So stressed around me Is that you are too Intimidated to tell me What you really think. You are keeping these feelings inside, And that is causing stress. So what is a solution? Solution is honesty, Laughter,and comedy. In short-- A vacation. It--what? No.no, I am talking about a roast! Of michael scott. Oh,come on! Who here has the comedy Central roast channel? You've seen it,right? Everybody gets together, And you start hurling Insults at the one guy, And everybody's laughing, And everybody is hugging each other. Michael,are you serious? You really want us to roast you? Mmm,si senor. - that's offensive. - it's not! It's not offensive during a roast. Anything goes. And i want you guys to really Get cracking on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun Of anything about me. It could be my race, Could be the fact that i'mo fit, Or i'm a womanizer. Fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write Your stuff for you. But i just want it to be good. Oh,my god. Oh,man. Oh,my god. I consider myself a good person. But i'm gonna try to make him cry. I can already feel people's Stress srting to melt.

He's supporting about Hey,you know what? Forgive me for caring,right? Well,you know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself--ever. And one time I walked in on him naked. And his thing is so small. How small is it? If it were an ipod, It would be a shuffle. Uh,can i make just A little announcement? In a professional roast, Usually the roaster will Say something nice About the roastee After they're done. Something about How much they love them, So just keep that in mind.

Thank you very much. Thank you.that was great. Great job,some great laughs. Really Really went after my intelligence,there. Dozens of online i.q. Tests might prove you wrong, But And my thing isn't tiny. It's average,so. Get your facts straight. So when i heard that There was going to be A roast in my honor,i thought-- Sorry. I have a frog in my throat. I decided to jot down Some quick thoughts about you people. First up,uh,phyllis and kevin. Dunder mifflin,this is pam. Uh,i'm sorry. Michael's not here right now. Can i take a message? Great. I will. Thanks. It's very unusual for michael Not to show up to work. My guess-- he's either deeply depressed Or an icicle has snapped off His roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit Of standing directly underneath them And staring up at them. And i always say,"michael, Ta two steps back And stare at the icicle from the side." And he's like,"no,i Like the way they look From standing directly Underneath them." It was only a matter of time. Michael is so dumb That he tries to put his m&ms In alphabetical order. All right,kevin. Enough with the michael jokes. I think he got it Bad enough yesterday. I'm almost done. That reeks,and i'm trying to eat. Attention,everyone. I've just Got a text from michael. He says,"personnel day." Are we hiring? Yep. You're being replaced. I think he meant "personal day." I don't know. That's quite a leap,pam. I hope he's okay. I feel bad. Give it up. He's dead. Well,he just sent a text. What's a text? You know,sometimes, To get perspective, I like to think about A spaceman on a star Incredibly far away. And our problems Don't matter to him Because we're just A distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me. Because he has an incredibly Powerful microscope And he can see my face. I'm okay. No,i'm not. Uh,phyllis,there's a package for you. Sign here. Okay. Got it. Sam. Sam,sam. It's not that you dumped My granddaughter, And it's not that You want children. It--it's that you lied to me. Can't you see that? Can't you see? Oh! I' never trust you. Lily,no. Oh! Lily! Lily,please! Lily,stop! I don't care how much Time we have left. I don't care what my friends say. And i don't care what your mom thinks. Frankly,i'm pretty sure She's not making any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment. Lily. I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. Lily. Lily! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button! Sam. Lily! Sam. Hey,dad. No,i know. Mom told me. Okay. Yeah,i'll see you then. So what did he say? Was it my fault? Yeah. He said that you told him How much you love me. About how you feel When i walk in a room, And about how you've never Doubted for a second That i'm the woman you want to Spend the rest of your life with. And i guess he's never Felt that with my mom, Even at their best. You okay? Yeah. When you're a kid,you assume Your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna Be right about that. I guess it also means That sometimes love Affairs look different To the people inside them. I'm not insightful enough To be a movie critic. Maybe i could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Or an art critic. That painting is bad. Michael. It's really good to see you. Why are you wearing a turtleneck? Are you all right? Michael,i feel i was A little harsh yesterday. - yeah. - yeah,we're really sorry. I,um,i spent The afternoon in the park Trying to feed the pigeons. I guess they all flew West for the winter. And i-- i just had some thoughts That i wanted to Share with you people. - what? - well,i wrote 'em down So i wouldn't forget. Jim,you're 6'11" And you weigh 90 pounds. Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight,you're a kiss-ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam,you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith,you've slept With so many guys, You're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin,i can't decide Between a fat joke and A dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed,your teeth called.

This morning, the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that our phones have a P.A. function. And then he just left. This is your captain speaking. The office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left-hand window, and you will see Vance Refrigeration. I am the ghost of salesmen past. Do not come near me! Yes, Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello, Doctor. I was just following up about my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it. Could I stick it with a pin? Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called. And it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets because they're yellow and they're wet with your urine. You And at 6'6" from the University of North Carolina, Jim Halpert! That's pretty funny. You know what? Did I drop my - What? - What the heck - Is that - You find it? I didn't. I'll look somewhere else. Would you like fries with that? Please drive around. Proofreading: So. & Valpi Episode 5x14 "Lecture Circuit (Part 1)" - Good morning. - Morning. You ready? And we're off! Like a herd of turtles. Pam and I have eloped. Actually, we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. Seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently, Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches except Nashua, so a little bit raw there But I am going to these branches and I am telling them my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices in a sales batter. That. Well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy. He brought a sled. That is a toboggan. You never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill. Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie. I love being on the road. but I especially love the time-and-a-half pay, 'Cause I have a mortgage now. Gotta bring home the bucks. Don't say "bucks." That's not ladylike. Here we go! So, what we do is we drive all day - and stay in hotels together at night. - Separate rooms. - That goes without saying. - I'm gonna say it anyway. Look at what you're wearing again. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? - This is a new cardigan. - Kind of Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something. Screw you. Excuse me. That is no way to address a superior. Screw you, too. - What was that all about? - You forgot her birthday. It was yesterday. Go ahead. You do it. I insist. After Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them both to step down from the party committee 'cause there was too much drama. - What he said was - Easy. There was a problem with having one head of the party committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads. - Party-planning is - I am a salesman. - the stupidest thing I've ever done. - This is humiliating. That's on my side. So this is fun. My birthday was yesterday and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl. Can I turn on the radio? I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare. But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do. Then listen to your iPod. - That's dangerous. - Well, then You know what? Let's just talk. That's OK. I can I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head. You're nervous about seeing Karen again? Since she was the other woman? Actually, you were the other woman, so. That was a long time ago. Is that why you're wearing makeup today? I'm not even wearing that much. I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me and she still hates me, so. This is a nice office. You don't have to lie. Through here. - Who's that? - She's out of your league. For your information, I've been with lots of beautiful women. Sexually? This conversation is over. I am single now. What we have here is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win. We wanted to say we are very sorry. - Screw you. You're dead to me. - If you say "screw you" one more Screw you. I don't forget your birthday. - I would never do that. - Guys, guys. We want to make it up. What can we do? I guess my only wish would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again. It's good that it happened to me because at least I can bear it. What kind of cake do you want, imbecile? Ice cream. Point at the Dunder Mifflin. Hello, Rolando. How are you? I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime. You're late. Everyone's waiting in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over. Don't be nervous. - Just picture her naked. - Stop it. - That's what I do. Steal my trick. - Please, cut it out. Hi, guys. - Is that Jim's? - What? Of course not. My head just exploded. Thank god. For everybody, right? You're huge! That's incredible! God. Sorry. Sorry, my head is I'm just I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex. Let's just get this over with, shall we? Ten. Ten months? Are you kidding? I'm not done yet. This fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons? They match the carpet. What is that? "It is your birthday", period. It's a statement of fact. - Not even an exclamation point? - This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer. I can't believe how bad this looks. Are you trying to hurt my feelings? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's. - Good then. - Have you collected the money? - I am working on it. - How much do you have? $6. That's how much you and I contributed! Damn it! I said I was working on it. Trying to see what CDs she's got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Feist. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you This is going to be hard for me to speak today because I just learned that my father has died. He didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No, you can't. Do you need to go pump? Not gonna have to do that till after I have the baby. I am wondering, what are you talking about? I am talking about how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you one The idea that my father had died. But now we think you're a liar. Would a liar bring mini mounds bars? I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor because I have these memorization tricks that I use. For instance, I learned the pledge of allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America And to the republic for which it stands One nation under God With a woof-woof here And a woof-woof there Here a woof, there a woof, Everywhere a woof, woof You get it. I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me your names. I have an amazing pneumonic device by which I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty. Mole. Lazy eye. Mexico. Baldy. Sugar boobs. Black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy. Your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny. It is reflective. Like a mirror. "M." Your name is Mark. Got it. It works. It's very insulting. But it works. I would like you to give this a shot. What do you say? But we already know each other's names. Then it will be easier for you. But I still think it's worthwhile to give it a try. All right, everyone. Meeting's over. I still have more. Can I please see you in my office, please? She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K." Karen. Pam, let's go. I can't accept these prices. They just cut our budget. Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes so I put Splenda in yours. How many did I put in there? One, two, three, four Splendas in your coffee, Stanley None in yours, Julia 'cause I don't know how you take it But if you'd rather Four Splenda. Are you crazy? I actually only put in two but that's not how the song goes. - Are you out of your damn mind? - Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office and you don't even set me up with her. We're not friends. I didn't think about it. We are friends. We're friends. And you let me down. You really like her, huh? I really like her with all my heart. Give me two clients for her. I grab this, and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself "for the Utica chain store massacre!" That is incredibly dangerous. - Don't worry. The chain is off. - No, it's not. I think I'm just gonna distill all of this and send it in an email to my team. Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. - Don't blow it. - So, when are you due? In about a month. That is wonderful. Congratulations. It just all happened so fast. It's really amazing. Congratulations. So, is there a guy or a person or a sperm machine that did this to you or? My husband impregnated me. His name is Dan. - This is us. So dorky. - He's cute. He's a dermatologist. We met at a bar. Can you believe that? - What is happening there? - Yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky. - It's really sweet. - No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time. So how are things in Scranton? - How's Jim? - They're good. Jim's good. We're engaged. That's so great. That's great. I'm so happy for you. Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment. I have to take care of things, so Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands and give my best to your mother. Let's see. With regards to billing, should we send bills to you or to your boyfriend's house? No, it could go straight to our business address. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you or Actually, I don't have a boyfriend. Really? Is that That's so weird. Stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl and I'm completely panicking. My desk is over This gal She's really into you? I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today, and we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room she totally looks up. Say no more. This is how I got Squeaky Fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her. It sounds risky. Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim? Wait, what? I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen - Kind of mean. - I like her. Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think. I'm serious. - I'm really glad I came. - Why? Because 'Cause I'll never wonder ever again if I did something wrong and now I have closure. She's happy and I don't know, it feels good. - Thanks for walking me out. - My pleasure. There's all kinds of weirdoes out here, so. - You must be freezing. - I am about to die. Will you wait here while I go get my jacket? No, it's OK. this is my car. Listen. You're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee. What's a "Nard-Dog"? This is the Nard-Dog. What the hell? I'm sorry. I thought we had this energy and I'm a mess, and I just had my heart broken, and you came in today and you're so pretty. - You're incredibly pretty. - I just got out of a relationship, too. - It's really hard. - Right! Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall or something, - just walk around? - I don't think so. That's You're right. It's too soon. Definitely too soon for me. So, I'm glad we got that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you in three months. I'm gonna call you about that order and maybe about that mall walk. Take care, Julia. Sorry I tried to kiss you. We lost the account. Damn it. - How old's Kelly? - Who is this? It's Mose. Who do you think it is? Mose doesn't know how to use a phone, so joke's on you. They only have numbered candles. How old is she? Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation? I'll call you back. I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidential file. Allow me to share. "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 "at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perform" Are you asleep? I'm just thinking about what you said. About Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R. Remind me. Blonde hair. Nice boobs. Not too big, not too small. Perfect boobs. Of course I remember Holly. She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she She just left. And I didn't I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that. Let's go. I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester. Screw 'em. Let's do this. I'm collecting $3 from everybody for Kelly's party. - I'd like to contribute. - Great. There you go.
I am on a lecture circuit. I'm going around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success. I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy eye, Mexico, Baldy. Then I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself for the Utica chain store massacre." - How's Jim? - We're engaged. - My God, I'm so happy for you. - Well Thank you. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R. She was the love of my life. She just left, and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. Let's go. Proofreading: So. & Valpi Episode 5x15 "Lecture Circuit (Part 2)" Two? I didn't eat lunch. I didn't eat all my lunch. Hello, everyone. Ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good. Angela, you're more chipper than usual. I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in Meet the Parents. Needless to say, she was very, very expensive. - How much? - $7,000. For a cat? I could get you a kid for that. Where'd you get the money? I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay. Wait, you didn't give it back? He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady! Seven grand. I gotta see that little bitch. I have something better than a picture. Come on. You have your cats on Nanny Cam? I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. When somebody has a kid, sure, take off a year. She's right. I had my 2nd kid just for the vacation. Right. Anyways I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone. Any cat, you mean. And person. So detour. We're adding Nashua to the lecture circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. I've been driving too long. - What did you do? - Stop yelling at me! - What did you do? - I didn't do anything! What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things. Like how to fashion a shiv? What the hell's going on? Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15? I was kickin' it. In juvie. What? Juvie nile detention center. - Where they send teenagers for - Got it. What did you do? Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. If she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. What did you do? My boyfriend dumped me, so I stole his boat. He told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. I thought it'd be really romantic, like Thelma and Louise, but with a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. I can't believe that you are making me talk about this on my birthday! I thought you said yesterday was your birthday. You know what? I got you a cake. You did? I want to see the cake. - I hate it. - How do you hate it? It's a cake. There's no flowers or toys or There's nothing on it. Where did you find a cake like this? It doesn't have my name on it. Do you know what my name is? - My name is Kelly! - Right. I forgot if there was an "e" between the "l" and the "y." I still don't know. I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme? - Birthday. - Frosting. Those aren't themes. There's always a theme. There's always a theme. Nice job on the cake, Bozo. Next time, I'll let you get the cake, and I'll scream at the birthday girl. A little bit more closer to the sign. - Do I look OK? - You look good. - Hi, can I help you? - Yes, you can. I am Michael Scott, regional manager of the Scranton branch. We were expecting you. Have a seat. Is Holly Flax anywhere here? Actually, she's on an H.R. retreat for the next three days. She's not here? If you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A.J. He's a salesman here. He's her boyfriend. He's just over there. She has a boyfriend. I'm so sorry. How could she do this to me, Pam? She's not doing it to hurt you. I can't do the presentation. Just Thinking about seeing him and thinking about him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her. It's just Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but Please, come on, I'm going through something. When Holly gets back, everyone'll tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing. And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die. Maybe. Maybe. One step at a time. You can do this. I can do this. I think there could be snacks or Why would we Is that what I think it is? Good God! That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady! - Awesome! - Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad. You stop it right now! - I swear, he is fixed. - I know fixed. That ain't fixed. - No way. - No, listen. You can't let what you see sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. I've gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Stop that! The other one's watching. So all we need is a theme and cups and ice and punch and a cake. Busy. What's that show that she's always talking about? Is this how you are with Pam? She must want to shoot herself. - I could use a little help. - I'm a little busy. We have a lot to do, and you are putting up a very effeminate sign. - Is that what you've been doing? - It's not effeminate. It's festive. You've been making that for something that we can just announce to the office? Everybody, the party's now at 3:00. I know, I just read it on the sign. Good morning, Viet Nashua! Sales. Sales is what "bwings" us together today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn about paper," and get them to show us the money? We are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. I know what the rest of you are thinking. Salesmen are the worst. They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome. Good listeners. Funny. Mr. Wonderful. So You're a salesman. What's your name? What kind of name is A.J.? What, do you race cars? I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand. You're funny. Very good and funny. Tell me, A.J. Are you dating? Is there somebody you date? Why, are you interested? I have a question about discounts from distributors. We will get to you. So you're dating somebody. Is it serious? It's pretty serious. Does she ever talk about me? - Excuse me? - What does this have to do with sales? It's all connected. Shut up. Does she ever mention Michael Scott? What are you talking about? Does it feel good? - Does what feel good? - Your life. Legs are sort of giving out. Long drive in the car. So let's just We'll just continue. Get off the floor. I can't do this, Pam. Just read Just read the cards. - Michael, you have to - No, I'm OK. I'm all right. That was weird. It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened, and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation. Sales is like a box of chocolates. You never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump. Blazer Freckles Penguin K.D. Lang Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! Cutting down the competition. Where is that bad cat? You know who you are. Excuse me, Petals. I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. You were bad. You look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. I'm talking to you right now. This is getting weird. Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? - Has this been on the entire time? - I have no idea. I was looking at pictures of food on my computer. Sorry I'm late. I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball. Don't look up. Want some pie? I went through Holly's things. - What? - I stole a sleeve of her sweater. I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael." You did what? I shouldn't have done it. It just I couldn't help it. She never sent it to you? She didn't. I'm gonna read it. Under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust. How? - Because she didn't sent it to you. - I know. You're right. I could read it. That wouldn't - I could read it. - You don't have to do that. Go get your laptop. What? I'm not in love with her. You have to write my suggestions down too. I'm not writing "horse hunt." - I don't even know what that means. - It's in the name. So far our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting. Forget horse hunting, it's stupid. Is there a birthday that you remember that you loved? Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. - Mother bites the cord. - Stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one. Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. What about you? When I was seven, my dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. We looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome. That's cool. You know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed! Didn't see that one coming. It's deleted. Well? She still has feelings for you. She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say? I can't tell you specifically, but it's not over. You're sure? - Happy birthday. - Surprise! It's not a surprise. - This doesn't look good. - What? You have a cake. You have a delicious cake with your name spelled correctly? - Told you. - You haven't heard our theme. You don't hear a theme. You see it. Why is there a chiclet on my cake? That's the best part. It represents a pillow or a television. - Our theme, if you will - Because the fun part is you decide on an hour of television or an hour of napping. That's our theme. I love it. OK, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor? Can she pick a half hour of each? Then pick TV. - Take a nap. - TV. Watching TV at work is really cool. Take a nap. Nothing good is on right now. Bonnie Hunt is on. I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap. - All right. - OK, nap it is. Everyone out. Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go. Move it! Let's go. Come on. I got this. This is for you. And Happy birthday, Kel. You've got one hour. I'm too excited to sleep. Great cake. Birthday time is over! Go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. Many happy returns. I feel great. So good to have closure. We should go apologize to Roy or something. - We don't need to. - Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? What about that fat guy from Stamford that insulted? - We should find him. - You mean Tony. Jabba the Hutt. Pizza the Hut. Fat guys like pizza. Pepperoni pizza. Pepperoni Tony. Man, was he fat. So, so fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I'd never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.

Yes,he bowled five frames with this pink,sparkly thing until a little girhad to ask for her ball back. But that girl must have had monstrous hands because the holes fit. No,you just have little dainty fingers. You could always model ladies' jewelry. Nobody asked,bob. Do you risk telling them how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself? - Oh,god,what did you do?- So-- Wait,not that i approve of any of it,but-- I was stupid.I told him. Was he into you in,like,a gay way? Moron. If he was,there wouldn't be a story. He told me he wasn't gay. Really sad. I'm not done yet. Oh,my god. A week later,a friend of mine calls me up and he says," I just saw him in a gay bar in kansas city. "  Oh,no. Well,then it's a happy ending,because he was gay. You should call him. My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them,and when things went bad,they had a duel over me. Yeah,dwight and andy.We were here. No,this was years ago when i was living in ohio. John mark anjohn david. Angela,you had two sets of different men actually duel over you? I guess i have. All right. Who's next?Where's andy? He's on one of his honeymoons. What? He made non-Refundable deposits on his honeymoons, So he's just knockin' 'em off one at a time.

We just ne tfind 'em. There's a girl out there for all of us. Maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together. A net?A giant net? No,not a giant net. - A-- A-- A--  What do you have in mind? I was thinking maybe like a mixer. - Oh,god.That's a terrible idea.- Old-Fashioned meat market. - No. - I don't think it is. Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? You're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Kind of like the guy who invented the seat belt. These people need love. And i am going to get it for them. Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about thhaceppiness of his employees than anything else.  I am going to be cupid,and i am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, And they are going to get hit,and say,"i'm in love! I was hit by cupid's sparrow. " Funny little bird,but he gets the job done.. No movement. Ah,still early. Eh,it's not that early. So how you holding up? I'm okay.Feel a little lopsided 'cause of all the blood they took out of my right side. No,no,i meant about being single today. Exactly. Oh,here we go. - Hello. - Hello. Dwight k.Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? - Dwight - Babe alert! Hello,i'm michael scott.Welcome to our little shindig. Oh,hi,i'm lynn. - Lynn,follow me.Come on in. - Off we go.

Well,he only gets better. - Thank you,michael. - Okay. I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot,any knot.Go ahead. Uh,i-- I believe you. You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact,there are many knots that i cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today? Um,i work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses. You must use a lot of paper. Oh,god.Tons of it. What's the rule about when people are in the bathroom? I think if you ordered hot food,you're allowed to eat. Damn. They've been in there for like ten minutes. Look at that. Bob ordered hot food. Yes. And i think they gave him too many fries. We should help him out. All right,the circle drive-In,they show old movies. It's really cool. That does sound cool. I used to go there with my fiancee. Before she left me. No,i-- I mean,before i left her. She left me. Stupid! I think i blew it. It all happened so fast. So fast. So erik,you mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair. I am. Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy. So that's sort of a repair. L right.I'll let you guys talk. It's going very well.People are mixing. A lot of hope. 'Cause that's what you hate to see-- When hope gets crushed. Sorry. Thought i heard somebody coming in. Um,so it's not too late. And the kind of discoun we're talking about are not-- Hold on,hold on. Michael,why do you keep looking at the front door? - No reason. - Is somebody after you? Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office? Hey,it just takes one. Nobody's after me. I just-- I met a woman when i was giving blood and i thought she might come by. You met a woman when you were giving blood?That is so romantic. It's not a big deal,really. I just-- You know,met mebody.We hardly talked. I picked up her glove,so i was hoping i could give it back to her. Oh,my god,that makes it even more romantic. This is like a modern-Dayenchanted. It's like a fairy tale. She could be your soul mate. Oh,not likely. Three billion women on the planet,most of them live in asia,so the numbers just don't add up. - It's possible. - She could be. Believe me,it's nothing. I hardly even talked to her. We just-- We were lying there next to each other. I think our blood bags touched. Here they come. - What? -No,just kidding. Seriously,though,that's enough. Well,just cover it with the broccoli. - Oh,great,i have to cover it with-- Do you think they dined and dashed? Well,they didn't dine. So yeah,maybe they just dashed. I thought we we having a nice time. We were. Yeah. - Empty. - Mine,too. Oh,boy. - Okay. - Oh,my go Is this the party? Nah. Okay,then. So where were we? Ah,bowling. Yep,yep.Yep. You didn't eat much there,jimbo. Oh,initially i did. Want some meat? - Oh,sure. - Little piece. No mushroom,though. - Forgot. - Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. Yeah. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously. Feel how sweaty my hand is. That's really sweaty. Are you on email? Oh,yeah. Cool. - Okay,bye. - Bye,kevin. Good valentine's. So basically the greater volume you decide to buy in,the greater discount we can give you. - Okay. - Okay? - What's up?-Look,i'm-- I'm gonna go. Before you go,i'd st love to get a firm commitment on this. Um  you know,maybe sign? Look,we already have a paper supplier. Okay. Well,thanks for wasting my time tonight. Idiot. God! You don't deserve her. Thanks,michael. Hey,if anybody wants to go-- - We can stay a little longer. - Really? Yeah. Yeah.Sure,michael. No,this is great. We'll hanout.Absolutely. Yeah. Oh,thanks. Michael,it's time. You know what?You guys-- You guys can head out. I'm-- I'm gonna soldier on a little bit. Come on. We'll all go. Yeah.Yeah.Let's go.Yeah. Okay. Four months ago,i dated a woman named holly. And,um,this is actually the first time that i've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what? Sometimes it's not about whether cinderella gets her slipper back, But it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know,they have all different sizes and shapes of feet. And hands. So i think i think my odds are pretty good. Pardon me.May i have a chocolate chip cookie? I gave blood earlier and i'm still feeling woozy. Of course. That's weird. You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using band-Aids. I,uh-- Oh,i feel so woozy. I just-- It's band-Aids. Ah,damn.
That's no problem. - Hang up. - Sure. - Knock, knock. - On the phone. - I know you are. Knock, knock. - You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0 - 5-5 - 5-9-1 - 0-1 - 7-4 - 7-5. - "Flive-ling." That makes us look unprofessional. They would never know it was me. Here we go. Who's there? - Buddha. - Buddha who? Buddha this bread for me, won't you? Great. I need something to wipe my hand. There's butter on my desk. - A classic. - I got a knock-knock joke. Michael, please? Please let me. - Who's there? - KGB. - KG - We will ask the questions. What the hell was that? What are you doing? - Stop that. Come on. - You like that? What are you doing? Mine was part of a joke! Mine was retribution. No more knock-knock jokes. - That's it. - Ding-dong. - Who's there? - KGB. - Dwight, get the door. - I'm not answering the door. - It's the KGB. - You get it. I'm not answering. You answer it. - I'm not gonna answer it. - It's the KGB! The KGB will wait for no one. It's true. Proofreading: So. & Valpi Episode 5x17 "Golden Ticket" Good morning, Michael. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonka! Good morning, Mr. Wonka. Your messages. Thank you very much. What are those? Tell me please! Jelly beans. They are not just ordinary jelly beans, little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans! The Willy Wonka golden ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I've ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to 10% off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy and full of excitement and full of fantasy. I have written these things because it is my responsibility as manager of this branch to "profiligate" great ideas, and I think I've done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends. Too many words. Good ideas are simple Golden ticket. Free paper. Jim, we're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get men on the Moon. Golden Girls That's a golden ticket idea, right? How great was that show. Golden Grahams, another Is it I don't get this. No, you don't. What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas, right? I think I should call her. Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today? You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, "I like you just the way you are." But I do like her just the way she is. That's not what we agreed on. What are you doing? Why don't you go on a date with her? Try to spark up an ongoing joke, and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know. You don't have to wait that long. You don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Ask her. You're asking him to give up all of his power. What power? Andy, Pam and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like. I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker. You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. "I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair." That's psychotic. - Do guys actually do that? - Guys with girlfriends don't. That's low, Tuna. Hey, Tom. What's that? You found a golden ticket. One of my clients found a golden ticket. No, congratulations. - Tell me. - I'll take that down. Was it a spoiled little girl with big lips? - I'm on the phone. - Or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession? Invite them on the tour! It's Blue Cross from Pennsylvania. Really? That's kind of a big client. How much of a hit is 10% of our Blue Cross account? - That's gonna hurt. - Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom. What's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say "Limit one per customer"? Nope, it doesn't. How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments? I thought I did. OK, I'm gonna call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales. You didn't. That It'll be fine. It'll be good. You idiot. Start over. Sir, I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes, and somehow they all ended up with Blue Cross. - How does this happen? - Were the boxes near each other? Irrelevant. I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper. I'm going to ask you something, and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet? My golden ticket idea OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There's a one in thirteen chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. That Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hi, David. No, I'm sorry. He's not back from the civil rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial. When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. "Stopping a fight in the parking lot." "An Obama fashion show." Whatever that is. Or "Trapped in an oil painting." I'm gonna save that one. Nobody panic. The good news is - they can't fire all of us, right? - They can. - No, they can't. - Yes, they can. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. What do you think shutting down a branch is? Then we're screwed! I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so I lost a ton of money today, and I've a mortgage, so I'm pissed, too. Jim is with me. Absolutely not. I'm mad at you. It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist. That's not why. We need a golden ticket idea to get us out of this mess. Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? Good one. Don't get that. Please. I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off? That is not constructive. Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. All right, I'll find out if he's out yet. Hello, David. I just got back from my procedure - What the hell is going on? - How are you doing? - Fine. What's going on? - My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera. Why did you okay this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune. How could you let this happen? There is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen. And I just don't I don't know. - How could you not know? - I think We might have hired an outside marketing consultant. We might have hired OK, what firm? You're breaking up. OK. I think it might have been an inside consultant. Was it the sales department? Was it Jim? OK, was it Dwight? Come on in. Good to see you. Have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea. That was your idea. Who told you that? You did. Several times. That was your idea. You were dressed as Willy Wonka. - I'm not taking credit. - Wasn't my idea. - I'd love to, but I can't. - Wait. I wrote it down in my diary. - You don't keep a diary. - Yes, I do. You've just never seen it. "March 4th. "Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets." Hold that thought. March "Michael came up with golden ticket idea to give 5 customers 10% off for 1 year." - Why do you have a diary? - To keep secrets from my computer. You know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie - when you were growing up. - Impossible. - Yes, you did. - I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetishized it that much would have made no sense to me. Plus we weren't allowed to see movies. Do the math. - What are you writing? - "Had conversation with Michael "about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies." Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us? With all my heart. You are throwing a lot at me. All I'm saying is that's the first date, so just keep a respectful distance. Right. I don't think Jim means that you shouldn't touch her. - No, that is what I mean. - Shush. A playful touch on the arm or on the back, it can show your interest, and it's really romantic. - Like that? - No. Stop it. Don't touch her, don't talk to her, don't look at her. Put your heart out there like that, it's liable to just turn into this blackened carbon brick. It has barbecue sauce of shame and rage, and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that. We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something, - and I will say what you're thinking. - What am I thinking right now? Nacho chips. I was thinking about how the skin is the largest organ of the body. Let me just cut to the chase. I want you to fall on your sword for me. Not gonna happen. I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again. Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? What's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly. What about Shoe La La? It's not ready yet. I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La, and it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby or for just lounging around the house. May I have your attention, please? I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together, and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight. These aren't announcements. You just don't care about the information. I love working here, and I do not wanna leave. He doesn't love it that much. It wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired. I mean, like we were talking about, that is why he has come to the conclusion We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world. Plowing my own acres, going around shirtless all day. Experiencing freedom. That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom. - Try me. - That's why you've made the decision. - I haven't made a decision yet. - You kind of have. You cannot take the fall for him. - He said he would do the same for me. - He can do the same, right now, by getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination. There he is. Get in. What's it gonna be? What are you gonna do? What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? How are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation. That's too bad. Yes, it is. But it had to be done, didn't it? Hopefully nothing that can't be undone, because, Dwight, I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited by the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations. You're welcome. I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant initiatives I've ever seen at this company, and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute! All right, Dwight! This is huge. That's what she said. - Very funny. - Dwight, great idea. Great idea. How'd you come up with that idea? - Inspiration. - Really? - How? - Never know when it's gonna strike. - How did it pop into your head? - Just "boom." Give me the details. You're talking to Dwight Schrute, the biggest Wonka fan I know. You've been talking about that movie for years. I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea, - and for that I apologize. - Apology rejected. Thanks so much for helping the company. - Good work, kid. - Thanks, old man. This is great. I wanna get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. - They should meet you. - Great idea. Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please? Sure. Could I be part of the meeting also? You have too much to do around here. I don't wanna take up your time. Let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. All right. Hey, guys. I have with me Dwight Schrute. - Dwight, take it away. - Listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy, sweet sugary candy, from the second it touches my tongue to the moment its metabolized by my stomach acid, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka. Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in? I hear panting. No dogs. So, I love Willy Wonka. The golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I came up with that idea. There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I can't vouch for that. But I do know this He is a liar. He has taken my idea. - That is my - We are gonna call you back. - What is going on here? - Here's what happened. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now it turns out that it's a great idea, and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that? - It is my idea. - How dare you? It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas! You are? Good ideas? Did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, a circular net you put inside the toilet to catch your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? - Formerly known as toilet guard? - Horse boat! A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. - Horse boat! - Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge that is more absorbent and softer than toilet paper. - I have a lot of toilet ideas. - 'Cause they're easy. - They're not easy. - Toilet piano bench. Women's urinal! Everybody has to go to the bathroom. Enough. Please. Enough. Is this true, Dwight? Is this true? It's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death! What do you want me to do now? What am I supposed to do now? David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame. I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes. I am gone. When they look back on this day in the history books, all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I'm going to write down in my diary. And that is what I want you to write down in yours. I am. In my own words. I wanna see it. I wanna see that. Give me the diary. I'm just gonna say to you everything that I'm thinking. I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie. Nice. Boobs. Well, it's his funeral, so Who is it? - KGB. - All right. I just got out of the shower. One second. When you are done, open the door. Hello in there? I'm late so I have to brush my teeth. It's a whole routine. We have other houses to visit. If you wanna come back then, that'd be fine. We'll come back at - How is 4:45? - I get home from work around 6:00. How about 5:15? You can try it. That might work. - Very well. We will come back at 5:15. - All right.
Since it is your 15th anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a 15-minute round of applause. - I like it. - Followed by a 15-minute moment of silence. I don't know. Is it classy enough? Enough with the classy, OK? I just feel like after 15 years at this company Bravo, by the way. That we should celebrate with a classy event, a night to remember. You're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama, and intrigue of my time here. And of course classy. And classy, yeah. You agree cause he's wearing a tux, don't you see what he's doing here? Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code so this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously. Here's one. A string quartet playing "classy-cal" music. You know That's good, but it's not classy. I need something classy, like the opening of a car dealership. That's it. Or Mr. Peanut. Mr. Peanut is not classy. He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle, and a top hat. - That's what makes him classy. - OK, how about this? An ice sculpture shaped like you, covered in chocolate, covered strawberries. You're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. The thing about classy is it's a state of mind. I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then. Let's try this one on for size. And I apologize, because it's right off the top of my head An ice sculpture Of you, completely surrounded - by chocolate-covered fruits. - Strawberries? - That's inspired. - I said that! Not classy. - Not classy at all. - Déclassé. French! Classy. Proofreading: So. & Valpi Episode 5x18 "New Boss" Hi, can I help you? I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott. Sure. Just one second. Have a seat. There's a Charles Miner here to see you. Miner? I hardly know her. Are you coming out now? Who have we here? It is Prince Charles Miner. At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner. And he is the new VP for the Northeast region, So just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. Here he is. There he is. - Hi, everyone. - Hold that thought! I want everybody to go into the break room, I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Would you escort our guest in there? Come on. Here we go, don't be shy. Don't be shy, you're one of us. Stall him a little bit. I'm going to get the fish. I wish you would've told the new boss was coming in. I didn't want to make everybody nervous. I mean, I could've brought a change of clothes. You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Let me get the fish. Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal mining communities. Surprise! There's nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! Come on! I'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is Surprise! As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles. - Took me all night. - This is what you did last night? I met this guy at corporate last week, and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him, and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So who knows? I do. It's going to be mental. It's going to be mental. He's like a black George Clooney. - Really? - I don't see it. I mean, he's okay, he's not unattractive. Hey, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert, from sales. I just wanted to say if you need anything, let me know. Why are you wearing a tuxedo? I didn't think you'd notice. It's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, he sent out this memo as he always does, and it was about professionalism in the workplace, and he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him. You'd understand it if you'd read the memo. There's probably one in the drawer. It was pretty crazy. But Not more crazy than wearing a tux at work, I grant you that. So, I'm going to - Your name's Jim? - Jim Halpert. Just going to let you get back to it. He just had to wear his tux today. - I thought it'd be funny. - Took him 40 minutes to get ready. All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here, I'd like you to meet somebody. - This is the accounting department. - I come from accounting, too. Nerd alert. This is Oscar Martinez. He is latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring that into work. It did not affect his job performance. And I'm very proud of him for that. Hey, Oscar. It's good to meet you. This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange. Where's the other? You know, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history. Well, perfect. Because we have now arrived at Kevin, and he has no sexual history. How about I just say hi to everyone at one time? Good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. And thank you for the C-shaped bagels. - That's great. - Above and beyond. You know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy. - True. - But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this. Stanley Hudson. Are there going to be layoffs? - No, absolutely not. - Hold on, Michael. Thank you. Stanley, you know We can't make any promises, but we'll try everything to avoid that. Do you have specifics? Michael should've filled you in last week. Due to the economy, there's a lot of worry going around, - I didn't want to worry people. - You didn't tell them? Why don't - What I told Michael - Charles is gonna tell you is that we are cutting Which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. And all overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office. Fantastic. - It's not official. - It is official. And actually guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending. Such as salary benefits, et cetera. - Et cetera, insurance. - Not salaries Petty cash, supplies and you know, parties. Things like that. - What about your party? - OK, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. He has a long trip home. Thank him for coming, we have to get back to work. - I'm going to stay for the day. - You don't have to. I've got this. This was just a meet and greet. It's more involved than that. I'm gonna set up in here. I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled. David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed. What gave you that idea? - It was my understanding. - I see. Why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability. Look, Michael. Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are gonna make a great team. - But the branch is still mine? - You're still the branch manager, yes. And if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know. Ask about the party. Right. Are you coming to my 15th anniversary party? - I'll give it my best shot. - No, the other thing. If we hired Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with the year-end tax stuff? You think he hung up? I got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other. And I agree. So, what I would like you to do is, tell me something that you've never told anybody before. Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before? Saticoy Steel. Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names. No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel. You're not from paper? - Does David know this? - Yeah, he just wants a good manager. Well, that actually is a excellent segway into really what is my only point. I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want to pick up some tips, observing here and taking them to the other branches, it's all good. Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny. And Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry. So - Are we clear? - That's not how I plan on doing things. I'll just bounce that off David, see if it comes back. I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way. Whatever David wants Michael Scott calling for David. Tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Come on, no. You have to charm them. David Wallace's office. Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today? - I'm good, thank you. - How's it hanging? - All right. - Listen. My name is Michael Scotch. And I just wanted to say that I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in five seconds What are you doing? - David Wallace's office. - Hi, Stephanie. Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch. The son's going to be returned, everything's fine. And I really need to talk to David. Please hold. Charles Miner. Hello, who is this? - Who is this? - I was never given a name. Can I help you? I don't think that anyone here Hey everyone, lunch is on me today. - That is so unnecessary. - Are you kidding me with this? - On the day that I bring in breakfast? - It's no big deal. I wish you had told us sooner. Because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad. You still have that option. - Thanks again, Charles. - You're welcome. Nobody thanked me for breakfast, except Charles. You say, "no more parties," and then you spend money on lunch. I think it's a little hypercritical. I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning. Damnit, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? Pick up the phone. Should I seduce him? No, no one wants to see that. I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it. You wanna do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes, you may Sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? I'm gonna need you to do that during office hours. This is my branch. You don't ask Charles, you ask me. I say "approved". That's not the way it's going to work. No, it is not. No, it is not. - So we're on the same page, great. - So we're on the same page, great. - Seriously. How old are you? - Seriously. How old are you? I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do. The more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad. - Five-years-old. - Five-years-old. Dude, stop. - That's great. - That's great. Stop it. - I'm going to walk away. - I'm going to walk away. - You need to stop doing that. - I'm kidding around! Relax everybody. It was just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our meeting in the conference room. And then out of that cake pops another stripper holding a smaller cake and then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one. - What is that smaller stripper holding? - A cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down. What exactly is the PPC? That's the party planning committee. They spend hours planning parties. Excuse me, guys. - What's going on in here? - Party planning. Not your concern. This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time. Really? How would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead. - I would like to get work, actually. - What you got, Jim? What is a two-way petting zoo? You pet the animals, they pet you back. It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay. It's just a regular-shaped cake. But it's cool This isn't a good use of company time. You're talking about my anniversary party. Everyone except for Michael, go back to your desks. - Thank you very much. - Here we go. - I'm dissolving this committee. - What? Come on, this is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity. News flash: I've been here for 15 years. Headline: you have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my 15th anniversary party. End of story. - I don't care if I've - End of story! hurt your feelings or you do not agree with my methods, but it is over. You know what? I'm going to New York! And I am going to talk to David Wallace, I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say you're screwed. And you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Right. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel, you don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. Come in. All right, Charles, I got to be honest, I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And truth be told, I'm a smart guy. And a hard-worker and a great number two for the office. - Number two? - Second in command. To my goal. I didn't know that position existed. At first, it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better. Assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that and Michael gave it to me. You're the assistant to the regional manager? - Assistant regional manager. - Any responsibilities come with it? No, not exactly. Do you want to keep this made up position? It's important to you? All right. I will - let you get back to it. - Would you OK, where is he? Is this the meeting you've been in all day? - How did you get here? - I drove. Cancelled, my 15th anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. He said, "no figs". I've already bought them. And I don't have a place to store them. So I feel like I've been sort of boned. Did you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this? I didn't know about the figs, specifically Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system, that I was supposed to talk to Charles and then Charles talk to you, and that will dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again. - That's not exactly the new system. - Clearly, that's what you wanted. and I've sacrificed a lot. I've put having a family on hold. - We didn't ask you to do that. - And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington. OK, it was nice meeting everyone. I will see you in a couple of weeks. Excellent. It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner. See you. See you. And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear. I can see our kids facing obstacles, behind half black and half indian but it's so worth it. There's just me here. I am gonna get him to buy me a prime rib tonight. I think he left. What? Move! Hello, Charles? Is that his scarf? Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster diving for companionship. I don't understand that, after 15 years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that. You're right. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm gonna do. We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party. You'll have your figs. I will be in attendance, it's gonna be great. How's that? I quit. What? You have no idea how high I can fly.
I had no idea when I got into that car to go to New York that I was going to be quitting. I got on the ramp, and I was like, "two hours, two hours to go. "Feelin' good. Crank some tunes. Should have peed before I left." Get to the good part. Get up to building. Revolving door broken. So I have to take the normal door. At least he's in the building. I was so nervous, it was the wrong building. I had walked into the wrong building. He finally has a story we really want to hear. And he knows it. OK, focus, focus. You're in the right building. You're with the right people. - What happened? - I looked at Wallace and I said, "I quit." And as I turned to leave, I looked back and I said, "You have no idea how high I can fly." You didn't tell him how sick of him you were? Why would I do that? Wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he's incompetent That he's wasted Maybe spit in his face. You have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it. I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I'll have one of my own someday. But I dream. Proofreading: So. & Valpi Episode 5x19 "Two weeks" About a week ago, Michael gave his 2 weeks' notice. Surprisingly, there is a big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying. Michael, is that scotch? Scotch and Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. Clinky clinky clink. Come on. Come on, come on. What am I gonna do? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. I'm gonna stay up all day. I'm gonna sleep up all night. I'm gonna give it a and I'm gonna stop worrying about calories. Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs. - I have a job. - For four more days. Do you have any leads? You don't understand At my level, you don't look for a job. - You are headhunted. - Have you called headhunters? Any good headhunter knows that I am available. Any really good headhunter will storm your village with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a knife. Right, 'cause that's what we're talking about. I need you to go over these client lists and indicate any wrong or false data. Your "I need you to" is my command. Can I talk to you? You can talk to me for as long as you want because I have all the time in the world. I just wanted to tell you that What's that? What is this about? 'Cause you're leaving and everything. It's a farewell. So I hope I get to work with you some day again. Me, too. - Is this wine? - Busted, yes. I already have wine. Isaac Silby here for the interview. Have a seat. It'll be a few minutes. You interviewing, too? Interviewing? For? Regional manager. Yes, I am. For regional manager, I've decided to go with an outside hire. For obvious reasons. - Where you from? - Philly. That's a drive. Well, this is one of the few places that's hiring. It's It's brutal out there. - When will the new copier be ready? - I'm working on it, Kev. You said it would be ready by today. And it is today. - It'll be ready soon. - "Soon" could mean anything. "Soon" could be three weeks. Is that what "soon" means to you? Sometimes. Then come back soon. During the course of business, a copier goes through something called "normal wear and tear." - I think it's 75 cents. - That's a lot. Bandit, no. Yesterday they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. It's monster.com. Singular. You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. Hi, you've reached Prince Paper. We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community, we are no longer in business. Thank you for your support and may God bless you. What am I gonna do? You want me to come into your office? All right. Close your eyes. - I'd prefer not to. - Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company. You're starting your own paper company. Why? 'Cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know. Do you know that the industry is in decline? God, I practically invented decline. I know paper. I know how to manage. - I have a name. Close your eyes. - I did that. It added nothing. Just close 'em. "Michael Scott Paper Company." You want in? Do you want to be a part of this? I am not gonna do this. - and you are not going to, either. - Obvious - Agreed. Except - Here's the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that "a," exists, and "b," has a salary because they're set up to do that kind of thing. What's up, Chuck? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Just talking. Michael handed in his notice. Did you also I didn't. - After you. - No, I'm staying. You want me to translate the german instructions? I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the english instructions. Typical american arrogance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II. Fine. Do the german instructions say what this is supposed to do? Deutsch. Let me see here. It is either an incense dispenser or a ceremonial sarcophagus. My german is pre-industrial and mostly religious. Listen, this order form Instead of "Dunder Mifflin", is there any way I could get it to say something else? Like "Michael Scott Paper Company"? Somebody's been talking in bed. Pillow talk. Listen, Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a big risk. This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now. You could give it up though, right? And almost no one would know. Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all of these clients. Half of 'em, at least. I can do it again. I know the market. I know the price points. I'm on it. Don't worry. So how do I do that? You can scan it. And then you can upload the image, - then you can copy - Could I take a piece of paper and just tape it with transparent tape? Good. Thank you very much. So that is why I have to leave at 5:00 on Tuesdays. It's to pick up my little sisters from school. We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians. - You can run this stuff by Toby. - I don't like talking Come in. I didn't realize you were with anyone. But I wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about earlier. We're in the middle of something It was so much fun last year. There was a sundae bar. I didn't have any You know, to stay trim. Did Michael just let anybody in his office? I loved invite us in all the time. He was like, "come in." I am aware of the effect I have on women. So you should be heading back to your desk. You'll let me know. She's such a special person. She's turning 50 this year. I'm starting my own paper company. No way! - In this climate? - In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in. It's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that? - Your own paper company. - Can you believe it? We'll see. It's a nugget of an idea right now, so. - Right. - Potential. Lots of potential. What a courageous venture. It's very courageous. Very exciting. Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities so With the farm. You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing. Think about it. Let's put a pin in it for now. I would love to put a pin in that. Everyone, can I have your attention? This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? Little Miss thing wants attention. It's a G-44. It's not ready, Kevin. I am at a crucial point where I have sunk four hours into that copier. And I am not gonna let it beat me like that wireless router did. - A note in my food? - I made it sterile. Just to say "sterile" doesn't make it so. I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, to come work for me. Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research? Financials? You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor-thin. Best-case scenario, you don't cut a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go five years without a salary? - Five years? - You already have the job. - You don't have to convince me. - It's just not prudent. Can't you see I'm urinating? Listen. You don't need to answer me now. Just I want you to think about it. I am starting my own company. You're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on $1 million. No, I didn't. You know what? I had a great time at prom. And no one said "yes" to that, either. How's it working? Let's see. It's fine. I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book in plastic with offset colors. Which feels You ready? I can't pretend I haven't seen that. I'm gonna ask you to stand up, walk out, and you can't take anything. I have immunity. It's my two weeks Not if you're starting a competing paper company. You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Please escort Charles from the building. Come on, man, let's go. I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy, and he's super funny. Maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there. Well, here we are. I would just like to You're done, Michael. All right, then, everybody. I'm out of here. - What is he doing? - It looks like he's saying something. I think he's singing. I can't believe this is really happening.  and I feel free. And just like that, as mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. The whole office feels darker. You know? It's just a sad, dark day. - He's gone. - I know. You don't have to kiss his ass anymore. Michael's like a movie on a plane. It's not great, but it's something to watch. And then when it's over, you're like, "How much time is left on this flight? "Now what?" Don't look down. Look straight up. Come on. Please. For employees only. Angela, Kevin, help me out. I need a few things. Then I'll be gone. Why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed and Meredith? I was going to. I wanted to, but I had to start somewhere. And you didn't want to start with us? Of course not. But now I want everybody. Buddy. Buddy. Jimbo. Did you have time to think about my offer? I did, but then I thought about something else. So which way are you leaning? It is tempting, but I am 100% leaning towards passing. Did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on? Let me know if you find it. We don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me. Stop. Don't look down. He's gonna see me. Not all the way up. Keep 'em at a normal height, OK? This is not Michael talking right now. This is your future. I am your future. You are older and you are very happy now because you went with Michael Scott, right? So everybody, come on down, and let's just crawl out of here together. All right? Come on. Are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? Everybody who's gonna go with me, I want you to stomp your foot. All right. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on, Phyllis. Here we go. Here we go. Get up. All right. Time to go. Time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on! - What are you doing? - I think maybe Hank should be here. No, I don't need Hank. You're gonna mess with me? I'll tell you something, Charles. I don't even care because I've got nothing to lose. All right. It's not worth it. What? I'm going with him. What? I'm going. You can't be serious. Michael, wait! I'm coming with you. You are? It's gonna be great. Great. Except I don't want to be a receptionist anymore. Right. - Executive assistant. - Salesman. All right. - Deal. - Deal. - Well, Jim? - Still no. Well, let's go. All my stuff is still upstairs. - Are people watching? - Probably. It's not how you leave an office. We're having a company meeting here. - I will bring all your stuff home. - OK, I'll see you later. See you later. So we had a personnel change today. Shouldn't affect our day-to-day, but until we get a new receptionist, I want Kevin on the phones. Phones. Also, there's been way too much wasting time. So Stanley I want you on top of that. I want you to be my productivity czar. Good. That's it on my list so, no excuses, guys. Let's get going, OK?

But it sounds like the rundown is really important. Charles asked me to do this rundown Of all my clients. Why don't you just ask him-- No, i can't. It was, like, hours ago. What have you been doing? Try another sentence. Last night was crazy. Jojo yeah. He did a doughnut in the parking lot In front of a cop. And then he yells, "hey, cop, you like doughnuts?"

How is tom,the homosexual sophomore? I wanted to start a company,not a war, Because in a war, You always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war Is that brother fought ainst brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case,war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important,though. That's just how the world works,i guess.

Shame, Jim. I expected more. In the last month, we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott. What can we do? They keep undercutting us on price. I don't want excuses. I want improvements. This is unacceptable. Hey, boss. I'd just like to point out that I have be here less time - than these guys. - Why are you telling me this? I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie. Is this something you really want to have said? I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it. I don't know what to do to inspire these people. - OK, maybe it's my fault - It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired. I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money. But I got your memo. Thank you. I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not. Well said, Angela. Been there, done that. You know what we need? We need some couches. We should really consider getting a delivery guy. You know what you would love? It's if we built a loft. Why would I love that? - Can we afford a delivery guy? - Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top. - I know what a loft is. - Most dorm rooms don't even have that. - Most do in the magazines. - Let's see what a delivery guy costs. We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft. Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? We've been expecting you, David Wallace. - Charles and I were waiting for you. - There he is. There he is. How was the trip up? A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure. It hasn't been that bad. These people are the salt of the earth. You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company. I feel like I should be thanking you. The conference room is ready if we want to get started. I just want to address everyone first. Take your time. Stanley, pay attention. Hi, everyone. Look. It's no secret It is no secret that Michael Scott has siphoned off a largchunk of our core business. I'm here I just want to reassure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback. Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call, none of us would've lost clients. I've been wondering that myself lately. Wee just gonna get started. We're gonna figure this out. Rest assured. - Jim, can you come in with us please? - Jim. Hold on. You know, David, Dwight's been my guy. I find that extraordinarily surprising. He shows promise. And Jim, I don't He's been disappointment. - We'll bring 'em both in. - Great. Dwight, come on in. Also Jim. Come along, afterthought. How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy? - If these numbers are correct - They are correct, sir. Then you can't afford to pay him anything. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss. Your prices are too low. Lowest in town. Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match? Corporate greed? Our pricing model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself. Over time with enough volume, we become profitable. With a fixed cost pricing model, that's correct. But you need to use a variable cost pricing model. OK, sure. Right. So Why don't you explain what that is So they can under - Explain what that is. - Explain what you think that is. - Just explain. - As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care, business expansion. Whatever, yeah. So At these prices, the more paper you sell the less money you'll make. Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business. They're actually putting you out of business. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again. - It's a program. There's no such - Just crunch 'em, please. Crunch. Did it help? Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. This is slightly embarrassing. I'm going to have to ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. We did. We got the check. But we're just going to need a much, much bigger check. When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, you don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, "Drive, kid. I trust you". Now would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers? - God, no. - Stupid. Makes us look weak. I agree. It just I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor. Really? Does he do good work or No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break? And then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out. Five minutes exactly. - Dwight, can I talk to you? - Sure thing. I saw you called. You're just out of business? We have maybe a month. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. - Don't worry about it. - We'll figure it out. We'll be okay. - That's what Michael said. Only this time we will be okay. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. - My new "Dwight" ring. - I like it. Good, right? Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way. Don't worry. Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died? - Steve Martin's not dead. - I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. And I was wrong. It's this. You want to hear something sad? I would love that. So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive, so I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-Mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview. I never went to Thailand. Really? I went to Fort Lauderdale. Was it nice? Yeah, it was amazing. There was a great pad thai place, though. I love pad thai. You never had pad thai. There's a lot I haven't done. This is the projection of over three months. - We still have the inventory sitting. - That's assuming he's gonna Let me float something out there. Can I just say something? There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option is to make Michael an offer. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out. But you didn't. Oh, man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure. - What is wrong with you? - Jim, you're pretty close with him. You think they'd be up for hearing an offer? I don't know. They've taken a good deal of clients. I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction. You know what? Why don't I do it? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. - Charles, you got my back? - Jim, I think you should go. OK, so I'll be back in Back in a bit. - Can I talk to you? - We're not hiring. - Actually here for something else. - I can't make you laugh right now. You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I tell what I'm here for? Turns out you've made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales. - Nice. - David Wallace has asked me to come and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out. Seriously? - Are you being serious? - He's bluffing. What you don't understand is that this company's worthl We don't have I'm here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout. - Maybe. - Three yes. I will see you titans of industry upstairs. We're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks. - Missed the last part. - That's a pun. Got it. OK, so you're not going to reveal in any way - that we're broke. - Of course not. That we're having any problems at all. Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate we are going broke. There is no way in hell that I'm going to say that we're broke. I'm really worried I'm gonna say it. You're fine. We have to come from a position of strength. - Put it out of your mind. - It is. I'm good. Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected. How the turntables In order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer. And we are prepared to reject that offer. - You haven't even heard - Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer? $12,000. Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was. What do you hear? Here's the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can't be making very much money. I don't know how your prices are so low but I know it can't keep up that way. I'm sure you're scared. Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get. I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. I don't need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you. I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000? - We'll have to talk - What? - We're gonna have to talk about this. - Just amongst ourselves. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time. - $60,000? - We are so rich. Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold. May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke. What? How'd you hear that? They've been calling their clients and begging them to pay more money. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures. Great work. I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked. You don't crack a case. At has a pejorative connotation. Like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty. So how long can they stay viable? What are your top five cases? - I'm gonna answer Charles. - Because you've solved zero cases. One. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Case closed. Do not go anywhere near the conference room. Done. Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. - Got it? - I'm not following you. You two are morons. Got it. Get out. So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer. We can finally put this whole thing behind us? Can you give us another minute please? How could you do this to me? You just cost me $60,000. - Why would you get the whole thing? - It's a lot of money. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish? I would rather have $60,000, honestly. No, Michael's right. Jobs are safer. Agreed? Agreed. But that's all, OK? - Discuss these things - Shut up. I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring. They don't make them anymore. And I want Charles gone. I am not firing Charles. He's very valuable. - That's very kind of you to say. - I need him gone. - Then I want Pam back. - You already have a new receptionist. Sales. - Pam's not a salesperson. - Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company - in its heyday. - That's right. - Please continue. - And Ryan. Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars. You know, David? I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family. - He is like a son to me. - Do you realize what you're asking for? You're talking about salary plus health benefits. And dental this time. Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a lot more than 60 grand. It's a multi-million dollar buyout. These are our demands. Your company cannot be worth that much. Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names. That's one of 'em! These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court. Deal. Can we have the room, please? Can you believe it? Great job! Right here! That's what I'm talking about! There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it. You're done.
At least once a year, i like to bring in Some of my kevin's famous chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic And dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own ancho chilies. Jesus. It's a recipe passed down from malones for generations. It's probably the thing i do best. the office S05 ep24 Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it? - Who is it? - Who is it? It's michael scott. Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes. Well, i guess the first order of business Is to welcome back me and pam and ryan. And how about casual friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual friday? You all look great. What i want to do right now Is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, Take it away. Your meeting. Wh-What are you doing? If there is something That you would like to say as a group, Then by all means, you may say it to me right now. Okay. - Yes. - People are dressed inappropriately. Take it up with toby. What i want you to do Is i want you to look inward. And i want you to reflect. And i want you to say something different. Can you give us a hint? When i needed salespeople for my new paper company, Everyone here turned their back on me. Am i going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am i going to ask for a big, crying apology? No. Am i going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that. Oscar, what were you going to say? Nothing. I didn't say anything. All right. Do i still have a job here? Not important. Okay, all right. - Yes. Yes, you have a job. - ?? Frankly, you have a job because ryan and pam Are starting with us as salesmen. - Wait, what? - How is that going to work? It's going to work very smoothly, Because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients From michael scott paper company and-- You mean the clients you stole from us. Yeah, aren't we getting those clients back? No, you lost those clients. - I call foul, sir. - Okay. You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients. Okay, dwight, let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that, Then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can. Don't fall in love with me, kid. Boscov's at the steamtown mall? It sure looked good on the mannequin. - Well, you have good taste. - Well, thanks. I sure wish i had more time to talk to my clients, though. What? Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients When you were stealing them? That i didn't have enough time for them? Oh, i, um Close your mouth, sweetie, you look like a trout. The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat! Can't you just not look at his feet? Excuse me? You're so educated, aren't you, toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet. Do your job! Well, i was in the seminary for a year And dropped out 'Cause i wanted to have sex with this girl, cathy. ??Followed her to scranton. Took the first job i could find in h.R. Later she divorced me. So no, i wouldn't say i have a passion for h.R. - There you are, my friend. - Oh, thanks, man. Pamela. - Thanks, michael. - Yep. Fresh hot ink. "New file system." Trust me, stanley, You're going to want to read this memo very carefully. ??I am not changing the way i do my files. No. No. This goes for all of you. Believe me, You are going to want to heat my words. When held over heat, The invisible ink will reveal That everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where i got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine. I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, But i'm not going to drive home to change. - I could loan you a pair of socks. - No. No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later. I don't think so. Andrew bernard. Okay, what are you still doing at your desk? What are you still doing not at your desk? Did you even read the memo? All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order-- No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, Except for ryan and pam, And get them down to the warehouse pronto. Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn. Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing. We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-Called salespeople Are being favored Because they all failed together. And frankly, i'm not convinced that michael and pam Didn't have a thing going while they were gone. Can i address that? - No, you're too close. - Okay. Stanley, how do you feel About those two taking your clients? It's not right. I don't like it. He doesn't like it. You don't take my clients away And give them to a secretary. No offense, jim. I think she's very pretty. Her face is okay, but. Jesus! What-- What are you doing here? I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight - or something-- - Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take ryan hostage. - Those sound too harsh. - No, i'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things. - Of course. - What is like a hostage? Excellent question. We could write a strongly-Worded letter. Words will never be enough. Strongly-Painted picture. - No, pictures are too interpretive. - Can i just say something? I know that tempers are high, But i think the best way to handle this Might be to just talk to michael directly. Well, that-- That's a great idea, jim. Oh, i totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, i guess. - I'll see everyone upstairs. - Great, see you upstairs. Come on. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action-- - That was great. - I know. - Why are you so mad? - You look so classy in that picture. I do? Well-- Where is that bowl? - Hey, you have a second? - Michael scott paper company only. Yeah, i think you're gonna want to cool it with that, 'Cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen. - Okay, well - tough. I will-- No, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom. This is awkward to talk about But there may or may not be-- But definitely is-- A mutiny forming in the warehouse right now. - Against who? - You. - Us. - What? It's gotta be because they all want their clients. The old michael scott might have taken this, But not the new michael scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with. Six weeks ago, None of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow. That was us, right there. We were something else. What you gotta do Is you gotta go down to that warehouse And you gotta crack some skulls. Chiklis style. Yeah, the commish. Yes, but chiklis shield style. - Okay. - Not commish style. Yeah, yeah. The shield. It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh? I know. Yeah, it's kinda-- Sometimes it's best just to stay out of it. That's true. That's right. Yeah. Want to play a game? Hey, gang. Where you been? Lunch. - Where'd you eat? - A restaurant. What'd you have, stanley? I had a salmon salad. With water, no ice. I was going to get a soda, But the waitress talked me out of it. Her name was flo, she had black hair. I had mexican food. So since you guys already ate, You won't be eating the stuff That you brought with you for lunch, will you? stanley. Is that egg salad? - Andy brought some salmon. - That looks great. Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry? I can eat. I'm going to have some of this meat sandwich. It's pony. What kind of sauce is on your salmon? Dijonnaise. Thanks for going out, guys. Hey, meredith, can i talk to you privately for a second? About what? Your outfit. What? What's wrong with my outfit? You-- You might consider pulling it down a touch. It's ri-- It's riding up a little high. A bunch of prudes. You know, oscar's allowed to wear sandals, But i'm not allowed to wear open-Toed shoes? Is that how it goes? Meredith, your boob is out. Fine. No! Meredith, too far! Damn it, meredith, where are your panties? It's casual day. Happy? Toby! Toby, toby! Toby. No. If you do that, i'm gonna do that. If you do that, i'm gonna do that. If you do this, i'm going to do that. Well, what if i just do this? You don't want to do that. I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like i'm describing a dream i had. I'm sorry you feel that way, mr. Bart. Is there anything i can do to make things better? Give me the phone. Give me the phone. - Exactly. - ??That's my client. - This is your first complaint in ten years. - ?? - Things have been generally good. - Give me the phone. Tell him dwight schrute wants to talk to him. - Look, uh, mr. Bart - hi, mr. Bart. - At these prices with this service - Hey, it's dwight here. - Give me the phone. - You're not gonna find this anywhere else. - Dwight schrute here. Hey, don't hang up. - No, no, no. Sir, don't listen. I know times are tough right now, And i laud your thriftiness. - Ryan, hand the phone over. - Ryan! Stop flustering me, everybody! Who let this boy on the phone? Mr. Bart! I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years! You made him lose the account By screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, ryan. You're a secretary! What do you know? - Okay. - And you're a temp. And i'm taking your phone. - I'm confiscating this. - Hey, hey, guys. You know what i want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, dwight. We want our clients back or we quit, michael. Who quits? Me. And me. Me too. You guys gotta be kidding. No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The schrute-Bernard- Lapin-Vance Stanley paper company. I love it. I love this idea, and i fully support you. As a matter of fact, i'm going to give you some seed money. There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, i want an apology, And i want a big one. - You want us to apologize to you? - Yes, i do. That's completely backwards. It's frontwards. Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, But we were the ones who got hurt. You should be apologizing to us. - That's right. - Right. Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us. No matter how i look at this, i am in the wrong. And i have looked at this thing, Like, a hundred different ways. From my point of view, From their point of view And the bottom line, i am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy. I need you to arrange a meeting Between me and the sales staff Without ryan and pam knowing. Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting? Whatever you guys did earlier. I don't know the first thing about secret meetings. - Just do it, okay? - I'll do-- - Get 'em there. Get 'em there. - I'll do the best i can. Are you kidding me? - Deceit does not come easy to me. - Okay, okay, okay. I really love your outfit. Thank you so much for saying that. I can't believe that toby thinks this is inappropriate. You look like j-Lo. So from the bottom of my heart To the top of my heart, i am sorry. Are you giving us our clients back? If we could just focus and go down the line, And everyone would say, "apology accepted," I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you-- Complimentary white chocolate bark. Nobody likes that stuff except for you. They wouldn't make it unless people liked it. Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about. Okay. If i give you your clients back There won't be enough clients for pam and ryan, And i promised both of them that they were gonna be salespeople. - So? - Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. Okay. However, i rescind my apology. - Okay. - That's fair. You are not reacting at all as i had hoped. What'd i tell you about building forts in my warehouse? Michael gave all of our clients Back to their old salespeople, So now there's not enough for both me and pam to stay on. He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day. I think you should get it. You really grew into it. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot And you'd be good at it. If you really think that, will you tell that to michael? That would go a long way coming from you. Yeah. Thanks. So hey, I want to set you up with my daughter. Oh, i'm engaged to pam. I thought you were gay. Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter? I don't know. Jim. Can i talk to you for a minute? Sure, let me just finish this turn. And bingo was his name. Let's go. Challenge. I need your help. This whole pam/ryan debate is screwing with my head. I don't want to be biased, but i am very close to ryan. - You know that. - You're close with pam too. - she's nice, i guess. - You know what? Best thing to do, pros and cons list. Pro for ryan, he went to business school. He's my number one choice. - Well, that's-- - I like his hair. Cons, ryan. He defrauded the company. - He has never made a sale. - Okay. - He definitely stole my ipod. - That sounds pretty biased. You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-Conscious 'Cause his mom drives him to work every day. Okay. Pam, pros. I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh-- New york and the whole art school thing. And roy. She has a weird voice. - That's not true. - I don't need to tell you that. I think she'd be a really good salesperson. I don't think you are being totally impartial, though, Because you haven't said one bad thing about pam. - And i won't. - Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And i'm going to go with my gut, and that's ryan. ?? You're right, sometimes when she is tired, She can be a little bit shrill. But that's not a weird voice. Take it easy. man! Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause i'm not going to have sex with you Unless you bring out the garba-- I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week i was at the video store. Do i rent devil wears prada again? Or do i finally get around to seeing sophie's choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision. You don't understand clothing, toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki. All right, look, what you gotta understand Is when you come to work, you give up certain rights. Listen up, flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Okay, earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants. All right, come on. Sit down, dwight. - No. - I'm running this meeting. - That's debatable. - It's not. ??It's not. Sit down or i'm writing you up. where has this guy been? Casual fridays are cancelled. Let's just not do it anymore. - No, it is a solution. - You're running from the problem. There's not a single appropriate outfit In this whole-- Except mine, quite honestly. Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat. ?? Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So i think i will just drag it out. - Since the dawn of time there has been-- - Just tell me. I gave ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So i had to-- - No, okay.Okay, i get it. Yeah. - I'm sorry. Sorry. Why are you giggling? Is this a joke? Michael, is this-- Did i get the job? - Yes, you did. - I did? - Yep. - For real, you're not kidding? - No, you-- No. - I did?! No, you're the best person for the job. - You're going to be great. - Oh, michael, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You will not be sorry. You should've seen your face. Oh, man! that was classic. I really thought i didn't get it. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - 'Cause you said i didn't. - Oh, man. That was really good. - That was really good. - Oh, what about ryan? I don't know, i offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when i offered him this job, And then i told him he didn't get the job, so. Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore. I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here. Thanks, michael. What's our receptionist's name? Erin. Could you send her in? Erin. Michael wants to see you. - Hello. - Hi. Have a seat. This is very difficult to say, But no one here likes you in the office And we are going to have to let you go. Hank, would you come up here, please? Hank is our security guard. - Oh, i can go. - He will be ushering you out. Oh, your face! - Is-- Do the people-- - No, i'm kidding. No, you're not-- You're not fired. Yet. Do they not like me, though? - I don't know, actually. - Okay.
Oh,my god! I can't believe it! I just won an art contest. Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that. Shut up. I got her! Not cool,dwight. Not cool,man. S05E25 Oh no! I still have the lease On the michael scott paper company, So occasionally i will sneak down here For a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tiptoeing around corporate,it is a ballet. When i am breaking all the rules,I'm break dancing. And expresso. Guys,i'm scared. I'm really scared. I think i'm growing into a giant, Because look at this normal-size coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. - Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on? - I do. Okay,how about a woman? Pam? Oh,i can't do lunch. I was just sending you an eil. Jim and i need to leave early today To meet with our contractor. - Oh,really? Okay. - Just sent it. What about the rest of you? At dunder mifflin,there is a very strict No-lunch-with-the-boss policy. And i don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my precessor stepped down. But at the michael scott paper company, I really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan every day. So rules be damned,I want to have lunch with these people. Who else? I don't do lunch. I'm doing five small meals a day now. Now that i'm back to doing the job Of a temp again, I find that food is one thing i can control. Okay,anyone? Anyone at all. Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me. No,i don't want to stay late to have a two-hour lunch. Mhael,we have a lot of work to do. - What?! - Work. Oh,well,god! What happened to you people? We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work Is work If you don't take out his battery, He just keeps going alda Oh,no,your battery fell out. I was just learning to love. Hi,guys. How are you doing? Erin,how many times do i have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask uhow we are doing Every time you interact with us. You're right. I'm sorry. Now,how can i help you? Did somebody here leave a map in the printer To youngstown,ohio? Attention,office. Who here is planning a trip Tooungstown,ohio? I will take your silence to mean That you're all hiding something. This location is the superior court-- So if someone's going to a court,big deal. It is a big deal. 'Cause there's only a handful of reasons Why someone would ever go to a courthouse in ohio, And not be charged with a crime. To claim ainheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit At age 141/2 instead of 15. - Erin,let me see your birth certificate. - Sure. There are other reasons to go to ohio. We're getting married today. So it turnsut it's the closest place To get a marriage license Without a three-day waiting period. - Tell 'em how it happened. - Okay,so we're going through all the wedding plans, And boy,it is complicated. - And very expensive. - Very expensive. 'Cause you say you want a small wedding And that's great. - But then you have to invite-- - You can't leave anyone out. - No one. - Okay,just get to the good part. Right. Oh,so this morning We are having breakfast together And i just looked up from my cereal And i said, "you know what i want to do today? I want to marry you. " I had just woken up. I didn't look cu. That's how i knew heth me eaofntfi icet. Michael? Are you gonna be working down here? Do you want these down here? No work! No work! No work! I come in here to relieve frustration. - Well,i like to swim. - That's good. ou have a cool place to come hang-- If you ever want to come down here,Door's always open. - Lock's broken,so - Thank you. Come on in. Hey,hey,here we go. There we go. - Now you got it. Now you got it. - Yeah,i do got it. Hey,you want some espresso? - Gotta keep yourself dehydrated - That's rule number one. Okay. I love it. I love it. Guys,i believe that i have figured out What is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone. Charles is gone. Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When i was in charge,This place was like dave & buster's. People just hanging out,having fun,eatin' apps. I don't know,it's like Dave died or something. Daddy's here,and daddy's gonna take care of you. Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy. I am your big daddy And i am gonna kiss the boo-boo. Widdle andy is afwaid. - Andy'safwaid? - Yes. - Are you all afwaid? - No. Daddy's here for you,my widdle angels. Okay,i think that i have figured a way To get you guys out of your funk. - What? - Funk is the problem. - And the solution. - That makes sense. I have taken my downstairs office, And i have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people Can get together to meet, to greet,To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see. Is this our punishment for not wanting To have lunch with you? Why don't you get over lunch,oscar? Everybody else is pastt. All work and no play Makes michael a dull boy. This is like a haunted coffeehouse? No,dwight is confusing you. It's more of a disco. A haunted disco! With coffee,but without the haunting. It's a combo dance house coffee bar? It is a daytime disco on the ground floor Of an industrial office building. - It's a cafe disco. - Exactly. - So,like,a disco cafe. - No,no. Not even close. I can't force you to go down,but i can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time. And all-you-can-eat espresso. Well,kevin,i guess it is just me and you. Holdin' down the fort. - This place is great. - Thank you. Oh,my god,kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from michael And come back up. - Sorry. - This is a no-work zone. Please respect the lei. Yeah,respect the lei. Come. - Kevin,stay. - Kevin,come. Stay,stay. - Come on,right now. - Cookie,kevin. Cookie. There is no cookie,kevin. Is there a cookie? - Wha-- - come on. Oh,for goodness sakes,kevin! There's no cookie. Come on! Come. I wanted a cookie. Completely unacceptable. Now i know what the founders of philip morris felt like. You just want to give people a smooth,fun way to relax. And suddenly you're just some terrible monster. Here we go. Oh,what the hell. Yeah Hi,jessica. Is bob in? Oh,he's on a call. - I'll just duck my head in. - It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can i give him a message before he gets off? Tell him i'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet Between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower,And he should join me there. I'll let him know. Phyllis? I like. All right. Back. There you go. There you gogood. Ooh,show me some attitude. Oh,god! Oh,no,no,no. What did you do? You didn't do that. You're okay. Let's lie down. Here we-- you wanna go down? Sorry. That's okay. That solved the problem. It's right here. I got your text. Who's philip? No,no,no. - Who tipped you over? Was it philip? It's my back. - It's her back We just-- we need-- okay,let's-- - call a doctor. You know what,we're gonna take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Come on. Come on. - Come back. - No,no,no. This is no good. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries,But more common than than wrist injuries. - I don't need a history lesson,okay? - What do you think history is? Just-- we need to get her out of there Because no one is going to want to go in there With a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait,wait,wait. But most importantly,We need to get her some medical attention asap. Stat. Rrroar! Ramming speed. Here we go. Here we go. Out of the way. Move it or lose it. - You having fun? - Oh,my god,what happened? Oh,just having too much fun. Phyllis,we're gonna put you in here. Dwight's gonna take care of you. What? No. I ought we were going to the hospital. If you want to get sick,you go to a hospital. Okay,dwight. Okay,good. I do not want anybody to worry. What happened to phyllis? Ooooh,you know. Nothing. She's-- We were hanging out at cafe disco, And she had a flare-up of an existing injury. But she's a tough old bird,so Can you please go back to work Instead of masterminding these situations Wherein we hurt ourselves. Okay,fine. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun. And i don't think she would trade that memory for anything. I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted By this nonsense. You all took a life here today. You did. The life of the party. - Erin - Yes? I want you to go downstairs,And i want you to shut it down. You mean,like,unplug the coffee machine And bring it up here? I don't care; bury it. I hope you're happy. Okay,i'm gonna need two able-bodied men. Cafe disco. More likecrappedisco. Oh,bad. There's girls in there. - Where? - The other room. - What other room? - Down the hall. - There's girls in there? - What'd i just say? - You get me my sandwich? - Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls! I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner. Comfy? All right. All right. Just relax. Relax,okay? - Dwight. Dwight! - Come on,relax. This shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment is correct,You grind your teeth? I do. No kidding. She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. Like children singing christmas carols. Oh,yeah,i'm wanting the vibe down here. Ashley,you made it! You invited someone? Was i not allowed to do that? I don't know,i've been here eight years,And i've never-- rude. I'm not sure,but i'm pretty sure Cafe disco is dead,But i can still hear the music in my head. I hear it too,boss. Better than imagined it. That feels good,dwight. - Tell me where it hurts. - Right-- ooh! Right there. You've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations And it always works. My grandfather was told that diamond dancer Would never race again. They were wrong. He came in ninth in the apple creek derby. And his jerky came in third the following year. A majestic beast. So fast,so tender. Welcome,welcome. Cafe disco. I am michael scott. - Hey,angela,welcome to-- - stop it. Angela,angela,angela, May i interest you in a triple expresso, Or perhaps a dance? No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. - I just need you to sign these. - All right. There you go. - You need to sign them all. - No,no,no. One signature for every song. Look,i hate to bethatperson, But i just don't like the general spirit of music. I know,i know. Angela,a lot of people doubted cafe disco at first, But it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could talk,they would say, "this is a magical place. You are safe here. We are talking walls. We're not going to eat you. " No! This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water-resistant As well as traps heat. Now i need you to lie still for an hour. An hour? I can't stay here an hour. girl. Boss,this used to hang from my windshield,But it belongs in here. Hey,thank you,creed. You really get this place. No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now. Look out. Here we go. Here we go,okay-- something's gonna happen. Here we go. I'm gonna go with the python. Oh,but the r so scary. No,please I find the rattle soothing. Puts me to sleep. I think bob's gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. What's so funny? When i say it out loud,it-it's so silly. Hey,hey,angela,no-- no cleaning up! You are forcing me to be down here. Am i not allowed to have some fun? No cleaning up. These are for you. They're beautiful. You ready? We should probably stop by. It would mean a lot to him. Jim and pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening! You wan dance,dwight? Ordinarily i would say no. But you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also,this song is fantastic. Mind if i steal my wife? You can't steal what is legally your property. Are those staples? This dance competition is not over. What dance competition? I was just dancing casually with my friends,ya! Yeah,right! You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand. - Oh,we're gonna stay. - Really? At least for one more dance. Oh,ho,not me,not me! Get out of here. Cafe disco! Come on,man! We're not even on the "y. - " This is so cheesy. - Yes. - I like cheesy. - Me too. You know,i think maybe i want aweddingwedding. - Me too. - Really? - Would you like to dance? - No. Well,stop trying to poke me With a sharp thing. You wanted to do this,okay. Just be brave. I know,but you're not a professional, And i'm thinking maybe we should have gone-- I'm doing-- no,i'm doing it for free. Just,you have to stop squirming Otherwise i'm gonna mess up. Are you sure that's not the gay ear? Gayare you 12 years old? - Well-- - Look,i'm gonna count to three. Count to 20. no,i'm gonna count to three. One,two,three. - Ow,son of a bitch! - Andy,that was just the ice. missing
Dunder mifflin. This is erin. He's not available right now. Uh-Huh. Yes. Sure, i'll give him the message when he gets up. Gets back. Michael had chicken pot pie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that. Michael had anentire chicken pot pie for lunch. And-- Let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-Sized Chicken pot pie for lunch, And then he promptly fell asleep. So we're all trying to be very quiet So as to not wake him up before 5:00 p.M. Which, actually, should be in about ten minutes. Okay, i'm gonna go in there And change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch? I can do it. What do you need from me? Normally, i don't condone leaving early. But i have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, i don't know. Nah, i'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor Who shoots your horse in the head When its leg is broken. Like clock work. Ohh. Oh, no. Uh-Oh. - What's so funny? - You had to be there! Oh, yay! Geography joke. Oh, my-- Oh, wow. Okay, all right. Let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale. Good night. - See you later. - Good-Bye, micel! - Yes! - Yes! All right, you ready for this?

Come on, who doesn't like a picnic? Tell 'em at happened last year. I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt. No, no, that guy who hit on me. Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance. Yeah, you don't grab these for balance. Well i'm gonna say 30. Insect repellant, which we clearly need, Reduces the effectiveness of spf. Good point, but thought of that already. Combination spf/repellant. - Whoa. Homemade? - Of course. You think the epa would ever allow that much deet? Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe That could increase his speed and not leave any tracks. Michael, isn't that holly? We're just friends. Hey, hey! Wait a second. Who let you in here is what i wanna know.

I wrote down a list of bullet points Why holly and i should be together, And i'm going to find the perfect moment today, And i'm going to tell her. Number one: "Holly, you and i are soup snakes." The-- And the reason is because, in terms of the soup, we like to-- That doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and i are soul mates. Jim, pam. - Hey, how are you? - Hey, charles. - Nice day, huh? - Yeah. Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.

Listen, guys, one more point, And we play corporat. Settle down, gentlemen. Good game! Welcome to the 43rd annual company picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now a couple of ployees have volunteered To entertain us with a song. Uh, it's a sketch now. Okay, introducing scranton's michael scott Performing with nashua's holly flax. I have not seen this. And now, presenting slumdunder mifflinaire! Are you ready to play slumdunder mifflinaire? Yes, i am! For $100. Where did dunder meet mifflinthe "A," on easy street. "B," a tour of dartmouth college. "C," they never met. "D," brushing their teeth. Ohhi'm thinking. I'm going to say "b," tour of dartmouth college. That is correct! How did you know that? I was there! Aah! I was a tour guide at dartmouth college! Noooo-Ho-Ho! Nice campus. Think you'll get in? Yeah, i'm definitely gettin' in. I'm a shoo-In. I'm robert dunder. I'm robert mifflin. Robert mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, Which over nine million americans suffer from, And is ?? For $250, How did he kill himself? "A," a rope. "B," a knife. "C," a gun. "D," brushing his teeth! $250 is more money than i've ever seen in my life. I will say "c," a gun. He shot himself in the head. That is correct! Yes! I usually don't enjoy the theater. But this is delightful. The economic downturn has been difficult recently, Forcing the closures of both camden and yonkers, To be followed soon By what other branch? For $500,000, Is it, "a," scranton? "B," buffalo? - "C," utica? - What? Or "d," toothbrush? I will say "b," buffalo! Final answer! That is correct! What is he talking about? - How did you know that? - David wallace told me! David, is this true? Okay, everyone, we're at a picnic today. Are we losing our jobs or not, david? - They didn't know? - I guess not. I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place To announce thisort of thing. But there have been talks about closing the buffalo branch. And we're-- We're closing the buffalo branch. You've gotta be kidding me! - Are you serious? - You've gotta be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it. How could you possibly think That the right way to announce a branch closing Was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic? Welli didn't know they didn't know. What about the fact that they're here today? - What about that? - That didn't throw up any alarms? No, michael need a little bit for his comedy sketch, And he thought, "oh, this would be really funny." - Thank you. - Damn it, michael. I told you that in confidence. Now i have to go over and deal with these employees And their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, "Is my daddy gonna have a job by christmas?" Well, he'ju thinking about his own gifts. Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances. Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever. How do you figure? Because if we don't play, Then the other team wins. Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked. Let's do this. Jim, come on! Look who just woke up! Uhh! I been up for a while! It's six to six. It's a nail-Biter. kav   Seven Now it's seven-Six. Or is that too much accounting for you? Here's an accounting question for you. What does one fiance plus one lover equal? ?? One whore. Okay, knock it off, rolph. What? She's sitting there, casting aspersions-- Rolph, please. I am asking nicely! - Rolph, leave it alone! - ??? - There you go. - You got it. ??? Boo-Yah! Get it! - I got it! - Pam! - You all right? - Yeah. No, no, no, i'm fine. - You sure? - Yeah. - easy??? - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. You wanna get that looked at. No, no, it's fine. Just give me a second. I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, So, technically, that is a company injury. You know, safest thing to do is get that examined. Right, david? - Yeah. - All right, you know what? You're justrying to get rid of our best player. Oh, jim, you're putting a volleyball game In front of your fiancee's health. No, uh-- Look, seriously. I can move it fine. Come on, let's go. It's our ball. Let's go! - I don't kw. - Yeah, i don't think we can let you play with that foot. Come on. Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital A few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em. I guess that's it for you, jim. All right, you know what? ???Come on, all-Black. We'll be back! Oh, man! I'm so mad that pam got hurt! Argh! Rrrah! I'll get it. Probably shouldn't ve mentioned buffalo. Hindsight. Should have had hindsight. How do you think it went before the buffalo thing? I think it went well. I think it was good. There weren't any laughs. No, it was a tough audience. Yeah, but we wrote it Specifically for this audience. Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, And that was one of them. Well, i'm glad we did it. Me too. We have a lot of good material For next year's sketch. I can't wait. Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, So you'll have to stall No, don't send in the subs yet. Dwight, i don't know. Think of something. Well, to be safe, we should do an x-Ray. How long will that take? Oh, it shouldn't be too bad. It's a slow day. So no other radiation this year? No metal plates? No chance you're pregnant? I'm sorry, could we just hurry this up? I' got a game to get back to. Oh, good, because my next question was Do you have a game to get back to? What'd you think? I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end That seemed like that went on a little long. But well, you guys should hit the road before i close down another branch. Okay. So good to see you. Good to see you. - Aj. - Michael. I didn't find the perfect moment, Because i think that today Was about just having today. And i think that we are one of those couples With a long story When people ask how we found each other. I will see her every now and then. And maybe one year, she'll be with somebody, And the i'll be with somebody. And it's gonna take a long time and then it's perfect. I'm in no rush. - Ha! - Dwight, come on, now. It's time to put in the subs. Yeah, it looks like pam won't make it back. - Okay? - Okay, fine. All right! Come on. Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt Before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? - Four? - Dwight no, no, hear me out. Five? - Six? - Dwight. Seven. Can i finish, please? Okay. Eight? ???H, dwight, we're so close. Just buy us a few more minutes. Well, they just called me in for an updat So i'll call you right back. ?? Hey, dwight, uh send in the subs. Ohh.

Um-- See those files behind kevin's desk? - Mm-Hmm. - Go put them all in random order. - Okay. - Then come back here For your next assignment concerning their order. This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns in a while Ever since michael's monica lewinsky incident. He didn't do anything sexual. He just made far, far too many monica lewinsky jokes. It was just easier for corporate to shutdown the program. - Think she did him? - I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer. If they get married before i do, i'm gonna kill myself. Who's getting married? Nobody. Somebody doesn't tell me, i'm gonna start screaming. - It's eric and megan. - Oh, hey, i hired them. Matchmaker. This place is like spaniard fly. They're not getting married. It's just talk. Did everybody know about this but me? There's nothing to know. It's just gossip. Okay. Okay. We haven't told anyone that i'm pregnant. What with her being unmarried. Knocked up by some guy. I mean, the yakkity-Yaks in this office would have a field day. Yeah, and we don't want them at the wedding Thinking jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgun. Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun? - Nope. - No shotgun? 'Cause that changes everything. Can't back out now, halpert. What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so Free at last. Free at last. No, keep it up. - You'll never guess what i know. - Okay, let me finish this thought. Eric likes megan. He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a quick date the other night. Apparently it went very well. - How do you know this? - People tell me things. I guess i have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And boom. Okay, what is it? What can't i guess? I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team Or being picked for a team and then showing up And realizing that the team doesn't exist Or that the sport doesn't exist. I should have known. Poopball? Oh, man, i know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said the third wheel is what makes it a tricycle. What are you talking about? I am talking about your group date with megan and eric. - At tink's? - Yes. - How'd you know about that? - Well-- Did stanley tell you? Stanley was on your group date? No, stanley was with his wife. I waved at him but he didn't wave back. Does anybody else know about this? No. There he goes. There he goes. So what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything? Nothing? I got a little something-Something. I don't know if i should say. - So just keep it to yourself then. - Stanley is having a midlife crisis. Stanley is way past the middle of his life, Especially considering his height to weight ratio. Well, apparently he and his wife Were out dancing at a club for young people. Teri's out of town, michael. - Who? - Stanley's wife teri. She's at an interior decorating expo in philly. And stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts. You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up. - What are you talking about? - Stanley's wife is out of town. - He was with somebody. - He was definitely with someone. Oh, was he? Well, who, his sister? I don't get it! If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal. Drugs? Making out. Oh, okay. Well-- Oh, no, okay. No, it's okay. Never mind. Carry on. Stanley is having an affair. - What? - I know. I am very happy right now, Thrilled perhaps, to be a part of the office, To be a part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attention and their eyes are lighting up Because they are very interested in what you have to say, That is a great feeling and i experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention. That and that are the same letter. "Q." No. No, okay. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed? - "T." - "T," yes! Yes! That is a "t" and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. Ou're almost there. Hey, stanley, where you going, big guy? Up to no good? I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that? No, no, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and i'm looking for a woman who can dance. Beautiful woman. Do you know anybody? Good-Bye. Pays $5 million. Nudity required. - You have to stop this. - Did you hear? Stanley's having an affair. I did from you. You got to stop telling people. Oh, okay, i get it. You feel out of the loop and you feel sorry for yourself And it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser. Do you even know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life. Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! No, no, no, no, no! Time to stop being polite and get real. Stanley, you having an affair? That is ridiculous. Of course not. Why would you think that? So it's not true. Okay. Well-- Oh. Those interns. They told me they saw you at the club And they all said it was you. It was clearly just - Racial profiling gossip. The little-- - Damn! - Told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club. - That's so stupid. It's just that - Teri's been traveling a lot lately - I know. I know. - It's been lonely. - Oh, i bet. Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse when i was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill. - I didn't intend-- - Wait, wait, wait. Ho--Hol-- So it is true? Yeah, but, michael, i'm going to go break it off. - That's where i'm headed right now, i swear. - Oh, my god. Wait a second. Do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool. I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please. - I'm not saying a damn thing. - I'm counting on you, michael. Okay. ??? Oh, that smells good. Yeah, i might have extra. It just depends on how many i eat. - Did you hear about angela? That's pretty weird. - Yeah. Well, what do you mean exactly? Well, the fact that she apparently is dating an 81-Year-Old billionaire Who owns a quiznos on the turnpike. - Really? - Uh-Huh. Right? How do you untell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip So that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, Including stanley is having an affair. It's like the end of spartacus. I have seen that movie half a dozen times And i still don't know who the real spartacus is. And that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit. - Kelly has an eating disorder. - Yeah. - She always eats my lunch. - Anorexia. She's ana-- She's an "anorexitec." - We should do something. - Nothing can be done. Just have to tell everybody and hope for the best, i guess. I'm worried about erin because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here. - Really? - Yeah. So--And andy is gay. - Andy bernard? - Mm-Hmm. Did you hear pam is pregnant? - Really? - Yeah. She's gonna hate being a mom. What? Tea. - So? - You would. I like tea. Oh, i bet you like it. Yeah. I like it a lot. I love tea. Do you like it as much as you like men's butts? What? 'Cause you're gay. Who told you that? Was it broccoli rob? Someone from chi psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school? This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence. It's a little too weird. Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa. Which it is, of course. But it makes you wonder. Did you hear the rumor about me? That i'm gay? - I did. Yes. - And? - What? Do you think it's true? Do you think that i'm gay? Are you attracted to other men? No. But let me kick you a scenario. I'm at, like, a beach cabana And brad pitt approaches, tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like, at first. But if he was persistent, i might give in a little bit To just really see what it felt like. Would i push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's, like, really aggressive? If you resisted brad pitt a little bit, He would still need to get to you? This is not real brad pitt. This is, like, in my-- This is my fantasy. Or it's, like, not fantasy. It's, like, what i'm-- It's just a scenario. Wow. I--I am-- I wish i could help you. I don't-- You might be gay. You might be gay. What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me. - How far along is pam? - A few months that's why they're rushing the wedding. Guys, guys, guys. You can't believe everything you hear. Like stanley having an affair. That is crazy. Just there's no stock in it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go. Okay, everybody. Big day. Last day for our interns. Lot of other stuff. Who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors. Present these to the dean for credit. And as a gift, i've attached my card. Call me anytime of the day or night. Why would we call you at night? Well, now you can't call me at all, so problem solved. And you're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs at night. Look to the intern on your left. Now to your right. One of you will do exceedingly well in business. Just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living and nothing more. And one of you will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be. - I am so happy you're eating again. - Me too. Dude, how come you never try to set me up? Oh, i don't really do that. But pam might have some friends though. - Women friends? - Yep. Not guy friends? - Are you interested in her guy friends? - No. - I mean, for the record, i prefer women. - Okay. But off the record, i'm kind of confused. Really? Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, i feel like. - Well, you got to figure this out. - Yeah, right? - Yeah. - How? You got to have sex with a woman - Right-O. - And then a man and then compare. Oh. All right. - Well, hey. - Yep? - Congratulations to you. - On what? Come on. Little baby tuna. Little junior toro. You know, a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard. What? - Want me to say it again? - Why did that come into your brain? Can i talk to you for a second? So they know. - Who did you tell? - I didn't tell anyone. - Who did you tell? - Nobody. Hey, did one of you tell stanley that i have asthma, 'cause i don't. If it gets out, they won't let me scuba. If i can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am i working toward? What? You think i'm the voice of the taco bell dog? What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How could i be a virgin? Has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today? Yeah, yeah. You know what? Let's discredit these rumors. Yeah, sure, but who's been saying all that stuff? That's not important, jim. I just think we shouldn't listen to any of this crap. Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning. I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me Working me with controls? I heard that from andy. I heard it from erin. I heard it from michael. Michael Michael? He's over here! - Where you going? - Nowhere. - Michael. - Hmm? You told people that i use store-Bought manure When i showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? - Don't get on it. - Michael, don't. - Don't get on. - Michael. - Do not. - Michael, no. - Stay, michael. - Step away. - Stay. - Don't. - Come on, boss. - No, no. - Okay, i made it all up. - What? - Even the fact that i'm gay? - Yes. Yes. But, guys, i'm a victim here too, okay? People have been saying that i am a j. Crew model. No, we heard that about jim. Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a j. Crew model and i was referring to myself. How is that a bad rumor? Because a lot of people think that models, Even though they're very attractive are somewhat vapid. It set our industry back quite a bit. Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, stanley's affair, Me being a spokesdog? You told everyone i was having an affair? Okay, okay, here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was, So all of you are off the hook except for this one person. Well, then what's the one true rumor? We have a right to know. Michael, am i gay? The one true rumor-- And this is gonna ruin this person's life--Is that-- That pam's pregnant. - I knew it. - I knew it. - I knew it. Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first i thought, oh, she has a new bra with padding. But then i thought, pam doesn't need padding. It just didn't add up, jim. Okay, thank you. - Congratulations. - That's really great, you guys. - Don't vaccinate it. - Who's the father? Jim. - How far along? - Four months. - Who's the ob-Gyn? - Stop. Don't say. All right. All right, you know this is not the truth And you can't fall on a sword this way. The real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair. - Nope. - Yes, jim. Thank you for trying to defend us, but actually, pam is pregnant and we can prove it - Yes. - If everybody would like to see proof. Want to--Okay. - Just gonna wait for her? - What's the "proof" mean? - Oh, my! There it is! - It's true! - Pam, look at that! That is the inside of your vagina. That's not how it works, but-- It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. Yeah. How long have you known about the pregnancy? A week? Month? A year? Michael, we only told our parents last week. Did you pee on a stick? I did. But it was inconclusive. You should have told me. You're right. We should have realized that you are an equal part of this. Yes? Michael, teri hudson returning your call. - You called stanley's wife? - Oh, oh, yeah. A long time ago. Just to make sure she was out of town. - Oh, god. - Don't take it. No, i have to take it or it'll seem suspicious. If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about stanley and that's gonna seem more suspicious. No, no, no. I can do this. - You can't do this. - Yes, i can. I am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo and i need her help. We will haggle about money and i will back down And then i won't talk to her until this whole cynthia thing's blown over. - Michael, please don't. - Sounds terrible. Hey, what up, cynthia? Just hang on a second, cynthia. Well, it turns out that teri was already suspicious Because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago. So stanley promised that he would stop and he did. End of story. Well, not exactly. Uh, cynthia kept calling him. She would not stop calling him and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia? Also married. So you can't stop love, i guess. And quite frankly, i don't think?? I learned that a company can describe an internship as full of exciting experiences, Even if that's a lie. There's no regulation. I learned that half these people's email password is "password." - I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets. - I thought it was 500. Oh. I guess i didn't learn anything. I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like jet li, Michael will call you jet li all summer. - Julia stiles. - Alan thicke.
- You wanted to see me? - Yes, Oscar, come on in. Close the door, if you would. Thanks so much for talking to me. Yeah, sure. I'm going in for a procedure today. Is everything okay? It's routine. I'm just a little bit scared. I'm sure everything will be fine. What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking? It is a colonoscopy. In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Chaudry? My main concern is should I have a safe word? Collioure mpm Jarick do_Ob Sk0r yomoy The Ni.Knight  Episode 6x02 The Meeting You think you can get me a rundown on the Buffalo clients by Monday? You know what? I'll do you one better. Sunday, Sunday night. Okay, I will get it Monday. Hold on, big guy. . You'll get it Wednesday. Jim, you want to hit the conference room? Good luck. Right, this thing. I remember now. - What's this about? me and David, if it's okay. That's okay with me, he's gonna want me in. It's okay. We got it. Really? Do you mind if I sit this out? , I'm gonna blow my brains out. Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? Because we are the Three Amigos. And once in a while, one of the amigos will go off to the bathroom while the other two have a secret meeting. Let me escort you to your desk. It's just three or four steps, but thank you. You and Jim are close, huh? I think the pregnancy really brought us together. What do you think he and David are talking about? - I don't know. . Did I? Doesn't sound like me. I'm not very superstitious. If you're lying to me right now, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk. Please don't talk about my breast milk. I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you? I just don't want you to. I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three-hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground, ladder's on top of me. And that's how you broke your ankle? Interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you if you fell off of it? This doesn't concern you. You need to walk away. Really? I'm sorry. I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden. , 'cause we'd have universal health care. - Be quiet. - I'm talking I will send this off to corporate, hold on to your medical bills. Feel better. Thanks, T-man. Later. So long, Darryl. Feel better. He's lying. He has a doctor's note. From who, Dr. J? You really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders.  painting his house. It was on the news. Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? "Y'all having birthday cake?" That's not a very good Darryl. How many foremen do you know that pull boxes? It just doesn't add up. We did a little investigation, and Dwight had a good point. The ladder didn't reach the top shelf. I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel. "I'll punch you into mush, see?" Well, if he doesn't like it, you can tell that S.O.B. that he is fired. . I will I love you too. Bye. - Who was that? - Sorry about that. What'd I miss? We would like to continue this meeting in private, - please, if you don't mind. - I do not mind. Yes, I do. No, I don't. Yes, I do. . on the flippity-flop. This call waiting. You tell the mayor he just lost six votes. They've been in there a while. Can't be good. Think they're talking about me? No, I think they're talking about me. That makes way more sense. Okay, thanks, boss. What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That is bull crap. Although it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch, which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you, there has been work every day. Had to come in on a Saturday to retrieve I left my cell phone here. So jealous of your boobs. I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable, and more than fine. Is Ryan going? I don't know, he hasn't RSVPed yet. We invited everyone in the office to our wedding, even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls. Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls. Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off if they came. So now people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work. Here's the deal. I really want to go. But I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong.  get him to go, for Jim. What can I do for you, hoss? - How are your sales doing? - How are my sales doing? Busted. My numbers are down. A little bit. It's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it. You're good. Okay, the truth is I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine. And it's a total mind f'er. Again with the cousin. I'm sorry, Phyllis. You explain this email, okay? "Hey, Andy, let's go visit grandma "and then get drunk together." I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room. Wallace had to show up on the one four-month period that I'm completely overwhelmed. You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? I don't believe that. I say go for the airtight plan. And that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant. - Be my eyes. - You got it. What have we here? Just backing up and turning around. We're gonna do this That's not for you. Pardonnez-moi, monsieur. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter, which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room. - Cheese platter? - Oui, oui, monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice, firm cheddar. Also from the great city of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar-style spread, which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind, which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a quick trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois, where you will find this fine blue cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the blue cheese. Bon appÃ©tit. I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Promise me you won't do anything until we speak. I won't. - Thanks for taking the time. - Appreciate it. Thank you, Jim. - Erin, is Michael around? - I think he's around here. You must have walked right past me. How you doing? ? - Yes, definitely. It sounds like a EMD P40. That's a GE. The P40 is much higher pitched. - You're into trains? - I've been my whole life. I'm rebuilding a turn-of-the-century steam engine in my slaughterhouse. That's so cool. . slaughterhouse, but, sure, any time. You know, 'cause of the trains. - Someone's coming. - Boy. It's Darryl! Get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera. Start taping. - Drive! - Worker's comp my ass! I can't believe this. You asshole! You gonna eat all that dog food yourself? Man! You OK? I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding. Yeah, I might stop by. It costs about $75 per person. I once had a glass of cognac that cost $77, so Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not? . - Ryan Howard yes? - Probably yes. Kelly Kapoor yes. Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilities? - Look who you're talking to. - Just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents. I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman or child . - And what about Jim? ready to move into a management position? - Permission to speak on the record. - Please, do. Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But when I put him in charge, no. I don't think so. Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. If I was going to put someone in charge, I would put Bert in charge. Or I would put , like Maria. - Or Gordon, maybe. - I thought you liked Jim. Very much. Jim is my best friend. But Here's his performance report. Right here. Now, this was written by Toby. Who we all know is extremely reliable. "Constant office distraction. "Spends way too much time at reception. "Antagonizes other salesmen. Not at all what he thinks he is." It's not very well written. But you get the gist. Is there anybody else could run the day-to-day of the branch? I could continue to run it myself, that's Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra workload. And it involved you being promoted to oversee. All Northeast sales. And then Jim would be promoted to your position. This was Jim's idea? I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H&R block. Here's the thing, though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping Plus, we have to worry about Jim. He has another job offer. We may have to replace him. I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example: he handed out jell-o shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown Marathon. ? - Sure. I can't help but feel partially responsible. Little pick-me-up. Those are the best. Sugar rush. talking to Wallace, did I come up at all? We did talk about how handsome you are. ? What did we We said I know there were certain things we said. I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today, I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. And I actually think that talk went really well. Then after he spoke with you, for some reason, it felt like things had changed. That's weird. That's weird. Kind of weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy? Did you say anything? Tell you what, when you leave this office, tell him that you should get that promotion. Really? You will? Wanna do it right now? I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark. I need to see your pupils. See if they're dilating. Is that them? Definitely. You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, Call my baby sister an asshole and told her to eat dog food? We thought that she was you. Why would you think a lady is me? Are you serious? Because you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this? - I don't see it. - Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you. Come on, Gwyneth. Sad. This is David. David, this is Michael Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive that promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction. You're changing your mind about Jim? Absolutely not! Like I said before, Jim is fantastic, and he deserves this job. It seems like you're cutting in and out. This is not what you said earlier. Here's the thing. Jim is the best man for this job. I think you should give it to him. It doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file. That was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs. I really don't know what's going on down there. Damn it! I'm getting pulled over for talking on my cell. Damn it. Darryl, look, we're here to apologize. - We're cool. - Wait. They're using the lift as their own personal elevator. He broke his ankle climbing over the railing, he lied about it 'cause it was a misuse of company equipment. - Case closed. . Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Let's just check the security tapes. I don't think there's any reason to check 'em. But I supposed if you wanted to be really certain All right. Fine, so whatever. You really did it. Now I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form. I'm telling them you sexually harassed my sister. No judges gonna believe that. We could all file complaints against each other, and just drown in a sea of paperwork. But, we'll just move on with our with our lives. So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that they would both file complaints with corporate, and now I got to do all this paperwork. We worked it out.  if you would punch me in the face. All right? Just do it. How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job? I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you. And I don't want to lose Pam. Now I don't want to lose the baby. Instead, you screwed me? That's what she said. - David Wallace is calling. - I'm in the middle of something. - Should I tell him you'll call back? - I'll tell him myself. Let's both. - You got Jim there with you? - No, it's just us. Can you call Jim in? I want him on this. Please. Here he is right now. Come in. So I spoke to Alan. We had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone's on board. Just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager. We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton, Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day-to-day, and, Michael, you would focus on clients and big picture stuff. - That sounds pretty cool. - I like that! So manager and co-manager. Co-manager and co-manager. There are a lot of moving pieces, .  because they know me as manager. Michael, can you pick up for one second? Okay, look, I'm not gonna force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine. You just say so. We'll find another solution. Is that what you want to do? - OK, people, listen up! - Everybody I have an announcement to make. Fraud was committed You have an announcement? - I was making it. Everybody, David Wallace and I've talked, And we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager. - Co-manager of what? - Of your butt! And your butt, and your butt All of Scranton branch butts. - What's happening to you, Michael? - What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager. We will be co-managers together. Welcome. Niagara falls in October? Hells yeah! Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card? I'll just tell you now. Easier. You've to choose a food option, and there's information in there about directions and lodging. I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs, I'll get the other information the day of. I'll text you. You're going to text me the morning of my wedding to ask for directions? And you will eat whatever is fanciest? Unless there's ribs. Rude. So rude, right? My gosh. I have been chasing people down all day. - It's incredible. My bag was there.
Could you please sign my expense report? No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic. - Sign this. - Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals. Sign it. No, not without a "please. " Idiot. I have a complaint about jim. That is not big picture. I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office. Okay. Jim won't sign my expense report. That is not Okay - That is day-to-day. - No, that his huge. - You're trying to trick me. Get out, get out, get out. - This has to do Get out, get out. I'd like to lodge a complaint. I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about? - You! - Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So When did this happen? - One minute ago. - Okay. And how do you feel? - Angry. - - All right. Did he hit you? - No. - Did you cry? - No. - Did you feel like crying? - No. - I'm just gonna write, "held back tears. " Wait, stop writing that. That is not true. If you stop crying, i'll stop writing it. I'm not cr Uhh! I deserved that promotion, not jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock. And he's gasping, he's panting. Every last breath. And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title. Ooh hah! Dwight, jim wants you to keep it down. the Office s06e03 Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while. - Michael - Yes? - Can I talk to you in my office for a second? - Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office? Can I also be a boss? Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would catholicism be without the popes? I have noticed that we Welcome. Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings. And I'm wondering if perhaps those are a bit, um - Disruptive. - Yes. No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. Okay, maybe we should talk specifics. - Let's do. - Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets. N Well, to be fair, jim James Jimothy To be fair, jimothy, the Ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called jim? - I am. - All right. Jim, to be fair, - the conversation wasn't about planets - Right. At first. We were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are. - Yes, I agree. - Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust. I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day. You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea. You mean on a weekend. Yes. How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential. All right. No more meetings this week. Really? You just agree to that? I can be very surprising. What's going on? I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant. You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy? Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight. Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts? We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry However much. It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't crate & barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash? Perfect. I hate registries. Oh, good. My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be surprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you? No, we're not. Good. Good. Mm-hmm? Okay, I thought I saw people missing. Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. - Got one of each. - Really? Hey, stanley, what was the last thing michael said before I came through the door? - Stanley, you don't need to answer that. - Stanley? "If you don't smell this, you're fired. " Okay, michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these. What do you mean by "these people"? Michael, this is a conference room meeting. Oh, hey, everybody, I think that jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room. - That's not what I meant. - Listen, jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important than what you want. - I disagree. - What do you guys think? - ??? - ???? Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with michael? No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also a co-manager. That is not what wallace told us. That's exactly what wallace told us. That is not the way I heard it. I love rivalries Michael or jim, paris or nicole, heidi or I.c. It's so much fun. But I guess if i'm really thinking about it and answering your question honestly, i'd have to go with I.c. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible. It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call david wallace. No, no, no. No, we will not call david wallace. I will call david wallace. David wallace is on line two for you guys. Or david wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just - Hey, david. You got jim here. - This is michael, senior co-manager. Hey, guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it. Got it, dave. Sounds like your classic big-picture decision. Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees. It's probably a little of both. - Which is it more of? - Excuse me? David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you Are you texting me? I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it? - Nope, not at all. - No, it will not be. - I am on top of it. - Very good. - Thanks a lot, david. - Talk to you later Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. All right, I am looking forward to this. - You don't have to lie. - I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work much better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, - I don't see you anymore. - alright All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are. All right. Let's get started. Hey, why haven't we ever, um We have. You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it. Do you mean, like break in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll? No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, jim. Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options. Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way? It's hard to tell so far. You use your brain too much. Are you advocating that I use it less? Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all. - You just came up with that. - As I was saying it. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro Everyone gets a little bit. Con You look like a nerd. Con No one gets as much as they did last year. Pro You get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds. Pro No favoritism. Con You unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there. I've been studying michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart How michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it. Hey, pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where. I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash. Like money? Like you You want my money? Mm-hmm. Will you take a check? Yeah. Cool. In the memo line, i'm gonna write, "to love's eternal glory. " Okay. Wait till monday. Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. Oh, look! "mrs. Pam halpert!" that's the first time I've seen it in writing. You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen. That will not go over well. I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us Oh, my god, are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself. I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking. No, I could not do that, jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, - and then another avenue. And then another - Michael. - You have a lot of strengths. - Oh, I do? Tell me what they are. I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well. Ha! That I am not known for that. But there is a reason why I'm here. Yes, you went over my head to wallace. No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, michael. Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, jim? Why don't you enliven me? I don't think you're good at making tough decisions. - Ah. - At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision. Okay, here's a tough decision for you. - You suck. You suck. Is that clear enough for you? - wait, but maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table. Okay, skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it. This had better be terrible. Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff. Wait. Seriously? Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. Thank you, jim, for thinking that we're smart people. But I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises? Excellent question, genius. It's because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. - Ooh, easy. That's not it at all. - ??? - Really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office. - What's going on? Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen. What the hell? Why are you being such a jerk? Hold on, kelly. Would it help you to know that jim thinks you're smart? No. How is that gonna repair ryan's car? This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us? Okay, dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so What about all these people, huh? How is it fair to them? - Exactly. - Totally. We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. - Yes. - Yes. They don't get 'em if we don't get 'em. My kid needs shoes! - You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes? - yeah Her kid needs shoes, jim! - What the hell? - ??? - ??? - ???? wow. I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so ??? That was good. That was good. Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you, and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend oscar a cup of sugar. - What are you talking about? Michael! - We just need to hear your plan for our raise. My plan A man Panama. That's not how that goes. You're not saying anything. At least jim was being direct. Thank you, meredith. When he was telling us his dumbass plan. We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no? All right, let me get this clear. Does everybody want a raise? yes! All right, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. Again, that gives us no information. This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood! What about a raise based on merit? - Rank each person individually. - Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. - Are you making a - Nope. I'm numbering the paper. - Just - Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us. It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. - We're in accounting. - I am so pissed at this company. - And jim. - Yeah. Who said that? - I think it was creed. - Yep. It's going really well, actually. Each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise, we each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv Who's that? Toby. He's not a part of this. You know that. Just wanted to draw a picture of him. Okay, your move. All right, who to pick? - Who to pick? - Here we go. I will skip a turn. Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that. I need more time. Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. People are starting to notice how terrible jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years, because stanley washington was napping, and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration, and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly. Come on in. That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces. What the hell? Things were not this bad when just michael was manager. Hey, what are you guys doing in here? What does a bean mean? on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me? Michael, what does a bean mean? Jim? I was just trying to be unbiased. What does a bean mean? Someone please explain it to kevin. Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours. Not according to the beans. This is how you make this important decision? There's no way that stanley gets more beans than me. That is ridiculous. This is how it works. It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning. Thank you. That is exactly By the way, I would also like a raise. Yeah, I would, too. Are we idiots? What right does jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as i? Is he as matronly as phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds. Let us storm his castle. Come on. Tick Let's get him. Tick And drag jim out of his office. Tock Take his keys away from him. Tick That's a clock. The time is getting very close. It's now or never. What say you? I say no. No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? - ??? - ??? okay. - ???? - ??? what does a bean mean? How you doing? Uh, on a scale of one to ten, i'd say I'm about a four. Oh, what are you usually? Six. You? Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right? I know, I know. We tried to find the fairest way to do it. - Yes, we did. - I just What? Um, nothing. I just I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. - michael! come on - ???? Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except pam I think. Is she still upset? - Michael! - Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this! - Thank you. - You're welcome. What's in here? Gin. Ooh. Just pretend we're not here. Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding? Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you. Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now or $5,000 a year from now? $100 now for sure. Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in 100 of my own money as the gift Yeah. No, no, I'll, um The hundred. I'll just take the hundred. Instead of $5,000 a year from now? How sure is this? The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game. don't tell jim.
My stomach's a little more sensiti lately, so if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less rfume And if your lunch is especiallpungent, maybe ve it in the break room. We would really preciate it. Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like,she is scred. It's amazing. A three-ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so badass. Phyllis,um,if you could switch to a different soap just for a month or two--? Yours is kind of perfumey. Now this is getting ridiculous. Oh,gee,i'm sorry. I guess i missed the meeting where we all voted for you to get pregnant. No. I resee the right to peel my hardboiled eggs at my desk. All morning i look fward to my afternoon cigars, and i am not stopping for anybody. I don't think i'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace. Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And Well,frankly,so does talking about it,so Well,what do you think? Spent all morning doing it. It is really special. Yeah,but aren't you supposed to do that to our-- no,it's great. Well,it's just a really important day fore. - Well,congrats. - Thanks. Dunder mifflin scranton will be closed today and friday for a company wedding in niagara falls, so please leave a messag and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day. Uh,believe it or not,kevin,firecrackers are in the "don't" column. So you're gonna provide them,en? No,this is a firecracker-free wedding. - What the hell? - You've got to be kidding me. Okay,all of the things are important to remember, but the most important thing is that no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding. Absolutely,because not everyone knows, and some people might be offended. Decent people everywhere will get offended. Well,we're thinking of my grandmother, who we haven't told,and who is very old-fashioned. Well,you're lucky to have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmother. You know,angela,um,you don't have to come to the wedding. - Really,pam? - Yes,she does. Yes,she does. We're all gonna go,and we're gonna have a good time. He pinched me. Next time we're all in this room,jim and i will be married. - We'll see. - Thank you,dwight. - Good-bye. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye. Oh,hey,and don't embarrass me when we go to niagara. What happens in niagara stays in niagara. Don't,don't,don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke. - No,i didn't steal your joke. - Yes,i said that yesterday. But you can say that about anything. What happens in accounting stays in accounting. No,no,no. Please,plse. Dwight,that's my joke. I know,but it's so easy. That's what i'm saying. - You can say-- - okay,this is what i am talking about. When we leave here and go up to niaga falls, we are representing dunder mifflin,everyone. This is a very important wedding for this branch. The most important wedding until get married, so i want you all on your best behavior. Or so he me,god! So i wilsee you uphere in "viagra" falls. Pam and jim's wedding will be the single best ckup destination in the history of the universe. I stole the gut list from jim's desk, and i search-engined every female on both sides of the family. - Get out of here. Yes. - Oh,my god,dwight. For instance,pam's cousin jocelyn webster. There's a name. Two years ago,she was selling a mountain bike. Oh,well,tell me about jocelyn. What's she like? Well,uh,she's really into mountain king but not so much lately. Okay. Uh,she had a couple hundred dollars to spend. I mean,if she was able to sell her bike,then Is that all you have on her? Well,if this in fact her,because it's a very common name. Okay. You're an idiot. People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office, but i'm going to turn that around at this wedding. I thought,"how can i take it to the next level?" the hair. It's the hair. Okay. Okay. I'm going. God. Hey,did one of you guys want to sit up front with me so i have someone to talk to? It's,like,a five-hour drive Ish. You know. Nah,this is so much cooler. We feel like we're in a limo and you're our drir. - Erin? - Oh,no. That wouldn't be fair to leave kelly alone in back. Not only is erin really sweet and cute She smells like my mom. - Hey,my aunt tolde something neat. - Yeah? She said everything with the weddingoes by so fast, we should try to take mental pictures of the high points. Oh,wow. That's cool. Yeah. Click. Oh,you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever. What a lou picture. Should have hired professional to take the mental ptures. Oh,god. - I was asleep. - What? No way. Those glasses are super dark. Okay. All right. We need some tunes,i think. You know wha i made you a cd. You did? That was nice of you. This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room. Oh,very thoughtful.

It's practical. My god. No. No. That's not how it works. Niagara falls used to be,like,a spiritual experience to people. Ey stayed in tents,and it blew their minds.

I wasn't sure about your branch of the famil after i heard about your parents divorce. But you and jim are just perfect. - God bless you. - Oh,thank you. But nobody's perfect.

And so kind. ",and that's when i'll do the face like-- like,"what? " right. And then wll just give 'em a little punch to the back. A noogie. You ow what? Never to married Never. For a noogie. They have hilarious material,and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me up there. Should be me and pete. Not pete and tom. Pam,you've got the greatestmile, - and your body is really fine. - Smoking. Hoping it'll make r wives kick it up a notch. A little mo' cardio. That's not appropriate. Okay,a little more Hello. Hi,everybody. I promise i wasn't nna make a toast,d i'm not going to. Just going to do a little freestanding comedy, and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim,then so be it. Hey,what is the deal with the smart car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? "oh,i'm so smart. "e equals mc Squared. I--i drive a smart car. " that's not smart in my book. The real smart car is kitt. - From knight rider. - Ight rider. That's a car that can talk. N a art car ta? Nope. That's not smart. And also chitty chitty bang bang. Very smart. And You-- everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh. - Nope. - Yeah,go ahead. All right. Hey,everyone. Thanks for coming. - Douche. - Ah,thanks,pete. That was really nice. I just wt to say how happy we are that allf you are hereonight, and i want to especially thank those of you who have traveled frofar away to be here with us tonight, especially the florida cousins,who obviously can't ke a hint. Four years ago,i was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And i do the hardest thing that i've ever had to do which was just to wait. Uh,don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam,i can now admit in front of friends and family that i do know how to make a photocopy. Didn't need yo help that many times. And,uh,do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive stick? Like,a year. - Ve been driving stick since high school,so - Very nice. For a really long time,that's all i had. I just had little moments with a girl o saw me as a friend. And a lot of peopl told me i was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who i worked with, but i think even then i knew that I was waiting r my we. So I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses-- not pam, for obvious reons,but everyone else,if y would raise your glasses - What's obvious? - Why can't pam drink? Pam can't drink? Who--i didn't-- i shouldn't have said that. I don't know why i did. She can do whatever she wants. Though she shouldn't. She shouldn't,becae she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I--no. What we nted-- the real reason is that,um That--that pam's pregnant. Ok. Okay,okay. Hey. What i thi jim is trying to say is that Th had an accident,and you know what? These two people,they're living together. They are having lots of consensual sex. - They wliving together? - Yes. Yes,they were living tog-- yes. And you know what? You can't expect them be careful every time, because,frankly,it's just a different sensation. - Michael. - When you come-- well,am i wrong? They say it's not different,but it's a different sensation - Oh,my god. Don't. Please. - When you use something to block I ink everybody knows what i am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman, - but it is different-- - michael. Okay. Okay,okay,okay. - Michael. Stop. - All rit. My point is,i said what i nted to say, and,meemaw,i hope you heard every word. All right. Jim. To waiting. To waiting. Okay. i should have known. The hotel's television set had a movie on called bruno last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, i couldn't turn it off. So i had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered,"how could they pick such a hotel? " mm. Now i know. Meemaw. Think it was a little uch and go at first, but we saved it,i believe. I can't believe it was me. I know. I can't believe it was you,either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me. Is there something about being a manager that mak you say stupid things? I have not found that to be the case. - Hey,smooth guys. - I'm so sorry. Can you believe it? He screwed up,not me. Meemaw's not coming to the wedding. She's leavin tomorrow morning. - Oh,my god. Are you serious? - There's gonna be a free room? Hi,meemaw. It's michael. Oh,you're that foul man that kept talking about intercourse. Yes. Yep,one and the same. May i? I'm actually great with old women. In fact,for the longest time,my best frie was my grandmother. And en she met harriet,and now she thinks she's better than everybody. I want to go to bed,but i can't. I can't turn that television off. Oh. Okay,well Hook you up there. - Oh,thank you. - You're welcome. It was that horrible charlie rose. Isn't he terrible? May i? Here's the thing. Um Meemaw,i think yo just need to chill out out this whole pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. Anwomen have sex before marriage. And i think we need to celebrate that. And i know in your day she would be considered a whore, ii but now women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them. And we need to encourage that. That's part of life. - People are like cats and dogs these days. - Exactly. - Thissed to be such a great country. - I know. I don't know what happened it. They're gonna name the baby after y,you know? They're gonna call it meaw. You mean sylvia. Yes. And if it's a boy,they will call it sylvio. Par-tay. Room 639. yes. Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys too,oscar. Like calvin klein models. That sounds epic. Can we bring anything? Nothing. Except for $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some prises i made. Whoo! No one from the office has been to a real beard throw-down. If i was a girl,i would seriously reconsider coming to this party. But don't tell them that i said that,'cause i want them there. And where do you thi you're gng? I was just gonna go down to the hotel bar for a little bit. Well,why don't i just save y some time and kick you in the stomach instead? I just wanted to get out of my room for a lite while. Okay. I'll go with you. Come on. Never mind. - Are you sure? Could fun. - Yup. No. - What are you wearing? - What? It's a casual,social outfit. Looks like you're going to a fish fry,dwight. No,th're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women. Because of howling during sex. Okay. Th's not appropriate,ight. Uncool. Uncool,dwight. Okay. Okay,come on. Let's go. Good. It's good. It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece. Yeah,but that's easy enough for you to say,oscar. You have that thick,beautiful,chicano hair. So nice. I'm just worried about the farm,you know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself. Dwight,shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm. Wait,you're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have? Nine and three quarters. I invented a device called burger on the go. It allows you to obtain six regular-sized hamburgers or without killing the animal. George foreman is still considering it.

The fundamentals of business. The fundamentals of business. Mental is a part of the word. I have underlined it. Because you're mental if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it. The fun is in it. - Fundamental. - Right. - Get out. - I am. Yes, so it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling. You need small talk. What topics can you use for small talk? Golf, stock market. - Dave Matthews. - Yes, what else? Small things Peas, ball bearings, dimes. - The weekend. - That's good. Come on up. Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing, and I will say, "So Meredith, "how was your weekend? What did you do?" I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet. - All right. - He calls it an upper-decker. don't know about business I could fill a book with. - Then do it. - What? Write a book. The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over 1 billion sold. More than the Bible. I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman  Episode 6x05 Mafia Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to. I'm sorry, just a sec. You're supposed to be the gatekeeper. Do you have any idea how valuable my time is? Your schedule just says nine till noon is creative space. - I thought this could be part of that. - Do you know how creative space works? Okay, I just canceled my afternoon. . It just says, "free play." Push "free play" till tomorrow morning. Sorry, crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made. Come in the conference room, and I will show you a finished sausage. As a manager of business, you got a lot of pride. But you also got a lot of responsibility. None greater, perhaps, than the need to be sure that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss. There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player. Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day, I came in, and I just stayed. 'cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks. What do you think? Think you're right. Definitely looks suspicious. And his southern italian heritage raises some flags. God forbid you Should have a fire in the warehouse. Definitely. All that paper burning up. And the truck goes off the side of the road. - There's injury. - I hear you. The truck. . I can be very, very persistent. Do your worst. Great. Would you look at that, people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh? ? - Nothing. Once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman. - Did he threaten you? - Not everything is a threat. - Mobsters are. - There is no such thing as monsters. - He drives an SUV. - I knew it. More trunk space. Or should I say corpse space? Guys, I drive an SUV. Does that mean I'm in the mob? No, not that by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster. When did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance. Mobsters have a front. Sometimes it's selling insurance. Sometimes, it's waste management or sanitation. Not all Italian-Americans are in the mafia. I think He just seemed like he was trying to sell me insurance. "Buy my insurance, or I burn your warehouse down." He did talk about a fire in the warehouse. And he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer. Who else is here? Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon, so there's not the usual balance between sane and others. Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The coalition for reason is extremely weak. Oscar says I checked out, huh? All right, hey, hey, hey! Calm down, calm down You lived in New York. What do you think? First of all, there's no such thing as "the mafia." What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name? It is Grotti. Boy. I mean, what? John Gotti, you idiot. It's a completely different name. - So he won't get caught. - It's pretty close. What mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti? - It weakens it. - No, I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it murder, not "mukduk." Too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences. - Lock your door! - I'm not gonna lock my door. It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon. What is going on? It's Michael. He thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. How do you usually handle this? We're in Puerto Rico, so It's Pam. We're on our honeymoon. Sorry.  physical danger, you should not be calling us. You're right. Sorry. It's from Grotti. He's following up. Already? This guy is persistent. "I feel "that you will regret "missing this great opportunity to be in business." That's bad. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it or Right. You heard him. He's gonna burn the warehouse down our trucks off the road. I'm calling the police. That is the stupidest thing you could do right now. He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported. Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horse's chopped-off head in your bed. - That's not gonna happen. - That's an exaggeration. - What am I supposed to do here? - When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back. I was thinking exactly the same thing. Criminals are like raccoons. You give them a taste of cat food, they'll back for the whole cat. The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people. . Hear him out. This is interesting. Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, violent. Let him know that you are not kind of guy that he can shake down. You're stubborn. dangerous. I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan. Hold on My plan is out. We do it the hard way. All right. I will meet with him. But I am not going alone. - You're gonna have to. - We're right beside you. What? What are you wearing? Who's Pat? If I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion. And I have to justify it somehow, so I'm a mechanic with a tire thing. Do you know how to use it? - To change tires? No. But it's metal. I could hit somebody.  - Should I change? - You're wearing loafers. Forget it! Take that thing off the table. Please. Then, I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it. The bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except this roach motel. You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax. Cool it. There he is. - Mr. Scott. - Mr. Grotti, we meet again. These are my associates. Hi. Angelo Grotti. - So - You got this table? What's this, one of them half-booths, can't decide what it is type of Waitress. - We're gonna sit over here. - That's fine. Hello, Mr. Halpert? The identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card. Man, do you think it was stolen? First, would you mind verifying your home address? Linden Ave., Scranton, PA. May I have the last four digits of your social security? Mr. Halpert, you're obviously not in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Wait a minute. Yes, I am. I'm going put a hold on your card. I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer. Very funny, sir. right away. Have a nice day. And thank you. Shoot. If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. You seem like a nice guy. He's not that nice. That's true. - That's very true. - Shut up. Have you decided? I'll have linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back. And for you, sir? I will have the gabba-gool. The what? The gabba-gool. - I don't really know what that is. - You know, gabba-gool. I don't have to have that. gabba-gool. think that we have that. - That's okay. Bring him the gabba-gool! I will have the spaghetti. With a side salad. If the salad is on top, I send it back. Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards? I usually can think quick on my feet. But they were so fast on the phone. This constitutes identify fraud. I wouldn't last in jail, Oscar. I'm not like you. What's that supposed to mean? You don't know about jail? You would love jail. Why would I love jail? Because You would love it. I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out. Look closely, Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you. Maybe we have a plan for you. How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt. You always think it can't happen to you, and Think about it. Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic? My battery's dead. help? Yes, I can. Come on, I'm sorry. We're having our salads. Come on. Lady in distress. Go, go! Sorry. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Do you need any help? I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on. Sit down. - He's a good mechanic. - Sit down. - Where were we? - I don't He was trying to force you to decide on a policy. So we're - choosing a check up dental. - All right. Put 'em down. Black goes on the red with the If we Positive It being a motor drive, it's just probably down. - He seems bad at this. - You want to do this, Junior? I didn't think so. I'm sorry. Kind of a long day at the mechanic store. - You got a leaky spark tube. - What? So your car's totaled. You're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great, but I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. Now, if you could just sign this letter of intend, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. You okay, Pat? I was just thinking about how I had this car, 'cause This Italian car. And I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil. But I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day, it exploded. And it killed everyone. And that's what I'm afraid of. Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car? It was before my technical training. Don't do it. - Do it. - Don't. Just do it. Look, Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you. But you have to decide for yourself. They gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow? I don't understand. Why would you buy a policy? It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour. . I'm proud of you. I had to make a snap decision. . You were sitting there for an hour. It was a lot of snap decisions. Do you know what snap decision means? - It means like this. - Just get in the car. Thank God. How did you get this number? - We're on a catamaran. - It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel that it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, 'cause you told me that your dad had a bad heart. Listen, man. I got a problem. I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier. - That sounds bad. - I know. And you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you, my friend.  All you're gonna need to And then go to - Are you - And you'll be saved. What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said. Just a And then you'll be saved. I missed the important part again. And you'll be saved. Please, repeat what you're saying. I can't understand you! Bermuda Triangle. Please don't call again. Question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford, given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away? Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it. What about this cash for clunkers thing? All right. It was a thought. We have let Michael down. And it's 85% your fault. He's alive, so you're welcome. Not on the inside, he's not. Look at his life. Broke. Living in fear. No friends, dead end job. Some of that existed before. Not the living in fear. That's new. You're right. That is new. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy. - I don't see that happening. - Me, neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy? Are you saying that we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain? What is wrong with you? him that the guy's not mafia. That seems a little far-fetched. More far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened. Incredible news. Grotti is clean. No, he's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. it works. What we're trying to say is we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean. It's true, he's clean. friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force, really. - Class act. Boy scout. he acts like he's mafia, though. He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman. And he made us all look like chumps. If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia, it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. And bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying, per se. But I would just get really quiet all of a sudden. - This is Grotti. - This is Scott. Great, Michael. I'm just finishing up your paperwork right now. Really? Is that supposed to scare me? I thought you'd be pleased. You thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of P.O.'d. - Why? - I think you know exactly why. Because you were trying to scare me - into buying insurance. - I don't get it. How was I scaring you? I think you knew exactly what you were doing, and frankly, I think you were being a total and utter jerk. You suck!  won't buy your stupid insurance. Let's wrap it up. - How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you if you show your face  Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give give me a call? Doubt it. What a tool. What? Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia. - What do you mean? - We just told you he wasn't mafia so you wouldn't be scared. - What? - You successfully backed down the mob. You made the mafia apologize to you. You made the mafia be polite. I should be mad at you, guys. But I'm not. So I looked him in the eye, and I said, "Not today, Grotti. "Not today. "And not tomorrow. "And not the next day or the day after that. "And you can tell all your friends "that if I see them, then they are already dead." I said something like that. Very close. Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg. Coffee. Not from the kitchen. Stop and shop. If it's not stop and shop, I send it back. Large. If it's a medium, I send it back. If it's an extra-large, I send it back. - How do you return coffee? - Go. Any questions? Are you kidding me? Is Jim there? Our credit card has been canceled, and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact hat you're calling us here! That sounds good. I'll let you go. Tell Jim that I said "Hi." I will. I will, Kevin. I will make that my top priority. They have no idea what happened.
They're back. Oh,yeah. Jim and pam. How was puerto rico? Was it so romantic? - It really was. - Really was. I'm so happy for you. Puerto rico was awesome. Oh,my gosh,the honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort,frank and benny. We hung out with them a lot. Frank and beans. Always makes her laugh. Frank and beans. Is there someone there? Who is there? - I hear voices,is somebody there? - Yeah! Is someone here? I can't see you. Because i'm blind. It's jim and pam,michael. - It is? - Yeah. They're back? - Oh! Oh! Oh,pam! - Nope. - And oh,jim - hi,michael. Oh,i haven't seen you since my accident that i had when i fell--i fell into the pool of acid,eyes first. Blind guy. Blind guy mcsqueezy. How do i describe it? It is a character i've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improv class absolutely hate him. So what'd you bring us? - Some candy. - What else? That's it. Oh,'cause you spent so much on the wedding. It's good to be home. This conversation has two items on the agenda. Do we have a conversation scheduled? Number one,do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you. Which brings me to item number two. I never formally congratulated you on your promotion. So i'd just like to say "con quack ulations. " wow,that's-- really thoughtful of you,dwight,thank you. You're welcome. I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now i can observe jim,trap jim,and destroy jim. Just like in the bavarian fairy tale. Only this time,the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the kaiser thing. I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years. It's a real handsome duck. Mallard. Okay,i'll get out of your hair. - Hey. - Hi. Uh,we brought back some puerto rican candy. Coco leche. That's my favorite. Awesome. I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it. Oh,um,let me just check with michael first. I think it'll be okay. I think it will too,but i'll just check with him,though. Great. Oops. Sorry. Oops. - I have recently taken a lover. - Well,that's great. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Who's the lucky lady? - Pam's mom. - What? - Pam's mom helene. Remember from your wedding? - You're messing with me. - About what? - You did not have sex with pam's mom. - Oh,big time. - What kind of car does she drive? - She drives a green camry. And the seats go all the way down. All the way down. Oh,my god. Oh,my god. - What? - Okay,never tell pam.  Okay,good,a pact. A pact. Although i may have to break it tonight when helene and i tell pam over dinner. - You all right? - Oh,my god. - Hey,jim. - Not now,toby,my god! - Oh,jesus. - Get the hell out of here,idiot. - What did i do? Okay,as far as dinner tonight,cancel that. And please,for both of our sakes, never,ever,ever see her again. I think you're underestimating pam. I think more than anything,she wants me to be happy. No,not more than anything. - Okay,i have a good thing with the mom-- - don't call her "the mom. " she's right on my way home from work. Then take a different way home,man! I di--all right. I'll take surface streets,it's-- the last thing in the world i would want to do is upset pam. - Okay,so we're good. - Yeah. Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two? Sure. Oh,is it okay if i put out some candy that pam brought back from puerto rico? Sure. Thanks for asking. Pam,we're all set. Yum. - Frank and beans. - Frank and beans. So what'd we decide for michael? The bottle of rum,or the seashell alarm clock? You know what? Can i have the weekend to decide? Bottle of rum it is. All right. Shall we? You know what,i am really slammed trying to catch up on everything here. And i know that michael's slammed too. So maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. Come on,it'll take two seconds. I feel like a real puerto rican. Michael,you're all set at botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people. Erin,look. - Fun. - Yeah. Wow. Botticelli's,that sounds like a special occasion. Yeah,no,it's nobody. I don't know,i think michael has a date. No. - I think you have a date. - I don't. I don't. - Come on. - Uh,i think we should just drop it. 'Cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it. - I don't deserve this,guys. - Yes,you do. - No,i don't. - Just take the parrot. Okay. Back to the old grind. I was probably gonna break up with her anyway. Oh,that's too bad. - Don't-- - pam,it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. - Sounds complicated. - It is. Yeah,but i mean,if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes. - You want me to be happy? - Of course. Part of the problem is she is the mother of a close friend of mine. Oh. More than a friend. A coworker. Oh. Gossip. Who is it? Who is it? Who is it,michael? Who? It's okay. No,no,no,no,no. Oh,no. Oh,my god! Oh,my god! Nooo! I honestly thought that could've gone one of two ways, but i never expected her to get upset. You seem tense. Hey,you want me to give you the chills? Okay. There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down. - The yolk is running down - mm,feels good. There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down. I'm sleeping with pam's mom. Sometimes dinner. The blood is gushing down,the blood is gushing down. You know,i really would've appreciated a heads up that you were into dating mothers. I would've introduced you to mine. How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have i complained about him to you? No,i am not being dramatic,you are being crazy! Who wants a hot chocolate? Thank you. Oh,so dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and i found a recording device in it. Yes. So i think if i played it just right, i can get dwight to live out the plot of national treasure. You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with michael scott. Andy,can i talk to you for a second? Sure thing,tuna boss. DWIGHT PICKED THE WRONG DAY TO PUT A WOODEN MALLARD IN MY OFFICE. How may i be of service to you? I am gonna need your advice. I was thinking of getting this opera for dwight's birthday. What do you think? I think he's really gonna like it. I think it's one of his favorites. This aria is a joke. Really? What are you thinking? - I was gonna go with this one. - Let me tell you something. If you respect him at all,you will get him something better. Bernard dog,what was that all about? I know,right? What were you guys talking about in there? Trust me,it would only make you mad. Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities. Is this because of the 60 minutes segment about working conditions in our peruvian paper mill? That was a hit job. If you read the dunder mifflin press release, it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here, and i'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other peoples' needs ahead of our own. And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice. Good,good. Okay,who wants to help the world one step at a time? - All right,good. - Volunteerism is important. Every weekend i volunteer at the local animal shelter, and they need a lot of help down there. - Last sunday i had to put down over 150 pets all by myself. - All right. That's-- - paint a mural of chicano leaders. - All right. I have a way to make scranton a better place. You could leave it. Okay,i'm outta here. See you later,guys. And stay out. Promise to write. Oh,no,here's an idea. Conservation. I love it. Conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings. No more meetings! Anybody else? Who else has an idea? I have some ideas about conservation. - Angela. Please. - Thank you. Hold down the fort. Hey,boo. First of all,i think that what's--why are you crying? What--what did she say to you? Yes,and i think we should look into that.  Speak up louder. - Well,our profit and loss-- - No,i'll talk toer. I will--no,nobody talks to my baby that way. Yeah,i'll let you know how it goes. Alright. Bye,pickle. Who's "pickle"? Pamela morgan beesly,you need to apologize to your mother right now. - I'm sorry,i was told i had the floor. - Yes. Whoa,hold on. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing at all. It'sll good. I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology. For trceying to find happiness in the arms of a lover? Don't call my mother your lover! Ooh,es! That is not okay,dude. - All right,in my defense - diusting. - That'sessed up,man. - Yes,thank you. Welcome to my personal hell. You have no sense of boundaries,micha. Shut up,oscar. He all right,you know what? Clearly i'm outnumbered here. But could i just say e thing? Please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring. I'm generous. I'm sensual. Is it real so horrible that i could possibly go out and find happiness? Good luck,michael. I hope y find what you're looking fo - maybe you're right. Who are we to-- - shut up,oscar. What is wronwith all of you? He is sleeping wh my mother! I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on. Let's get back to the matr at hand. Whatever. You know. Sleep with my mom,sleep with everybody's mom. - No,no,no,no. - Wh,that's my mom you're talng about. I don't like the tone here. Th is a place of business. You are to listen to others,you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it. Oh,my god,you are ridiculous! Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss,and i may someday be your father,so t out. You are never gonna bealy father. You geout. I hope that you are willing to die in this oice,because i am. Me too. - Hey. - Hey. Pam,how's your day going? Pam,just for the record,i thk you're overreacting a little bit. Your mom's old enough to make her own decisis. Oh,well,thanks,oscar. I was just wondering,how would you feel if michael was sleeping with your mom? My mother' in a whechair. Well,he could still i'm sorry about that. Oh,couli just get you to sign this second page as well? Ryan,have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that i should get a fedora? Uh,i don't think so,no. Why? I think i'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora? I'd rather not say. You thk i'm gonna get the same fedora as you? Hey,dwight. - I think i would look really cute - it has to go with the peona that you aeady have. But i i think i have that persona.

That was uncled for. I'm sorry. Uh,yeah,that means a lot thank you for saying it. - Can i sit wn for a second? - Yeah,pull up a chair and sit. Or on the shredder. This is gonna sound weird, but i think i may be the victim of a htile work environment with this whole pam situation. Should probably deal with that outside of the workplace. She brought it into the worlace,so i feel like it has to be dealt with here. Yeah. Okay,well,i mean,i could talk to her. - Really? Would you do that? - Ll,yeah. That's why--that's why they pay me the big bucks. You're a good,good guy. Um,okay. You know,i always knew if michael just took the time to get to know m we'd bece friends. Hey,pam. Could i talk to you for a sec? Sure. What up? Well,i was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened day it'd be a good idea for you and and michael to head into the conferenc for so conflict resolution. What's the matter,can't fight your own battl? No. That's i think you should just take the rest of the day off. Oh,would that make you feebetter? I dot--i'm-- i cat hear your convertion. You can tell michael that i'm not lving. - Buddy,i think that we can't make her leave,so - yeah,yeah,you're-- okay,you're a jackass. Hey. Hey,yoknow what? Ur just as stubbn as your mother.

Well,I really didn't want to put it on the board, but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow,so What are you gonna do? Okay. That is our sales pitch, and we are stickin' to it. Well,you two are quite the salesmen, and a very cute couple. Well,it's Thank you. Thank you. Some couples don't seem like a good match, but you two do. Well,you know. Yeah,you know,two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook He loves to eat. I love to dance. I love to watch him dance. Right,sometimes i'll just dance for hours in the living room And I'll watch him. And a baby on the way? You must be so excited. Mmm. Yes. Yeah,we are thrilled. In fact,we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. - Wasn't that fun,honey? - It was,sweetie. Oh,I know the best teacher. Her name's Miss janet. Yeah,on clearview avenue. Yeah!Yeah. This sounds ridiculous,I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel. So now you're comparing yourself to a cute,tiny animal? Um,michael? Hmm? The custodian called again. Apparently,a kol has died. It's a fish. They want you to pay for it. It could have died of natural causes,though. Well,they said you stepped on its head. He did not suffer. Um,when is the funeral? Do not mock,oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want? $300. What? No. I could get a fish for a five-cent worm. Oh,you're paying way too much for worms,then. Who's your worm guy? Okay,great meeting,everybody. That's it. No,no. Thank you. No! We are not done here. This One of the baby books suggests the best birthing posture is on all fours like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly what the little soybean wants,right? Hey,li'l soybean,what do you want? Right. How do It I felt a kick. - Oh,that's great. - Oh,my gosh,like a little magical foot just high-fived me. Yeah. Well,that'll happen. Oh,my gosh.

Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power drill. Maybe if you make fun of yourself,it'll all go away. I want to make fun of you right now. Really? Do it. I am a big,stupid goofball. No,don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid. See? Oh,my god. Hey,I I just want to say that I cannot believe that I walked into a kol pond. I mean,seriously,walk much? Oh! I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to. Michael,you know,when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean,who puts a kol pond in a lobby? Well,you know what? You're right,phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing,I am a world-class moron. Michael,please,stop it now.You're embarrassing yourself. It's okay. We're having fun. It's actually not the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. Well In high school,the girl's volleyball team always used to throw me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Ha! Ohh! It was freezing! No,no,no! Oh,this is even worse. Couple of weeks ago,I went to get a new cell phone, and I wanted one of those packages where you have the five You know,the friends, friends and family thing? And the guy was like,"who are your five friends?" and I'm like,"uh " I didn't even know! I couldn't even think. Oh,my god! It was so embarrassing! That was,well I don't even have jan's cell phone number, and I hate her! She won't give it to me. It's like,oh,well,I guess I'm a loser. A loo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ser! Too far! God! Thanks a lot,man. Thanks for the advice. Enjoying your nut? Why? I'm not mocking.I was just making an observation about her Nut. I was. Hey,who wants to watch michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me, and he's bringing it over. Mmm,you know what?Maybe we should go easy on michael,guys. You know,you watch that tape, and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitivity training,so We'll stay late. Well,that went pretty well. Yeah,I guess. We got a maybe. Was our first maybe. Going by the nard-dog curve,i'd say we nailed it. If I'm being completely honest,I could have done without the belly kiss. You know what? I'm sorry, 'cause in that moment, I knew I was kissing your belly too much. - Yeah,way too much. - Yeah. I mean,what the hell was that? What the heck was that? When you cried. Ahh! Try "almost cried," okay? I just got caught up in the fantasy. Your fantasy involves comparison shopping birthing classes? No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss janet. I just I don't know,it was fun to role-play,right? I mean,it's fun for me, having a wife and a little baby. I'm so sick of being single. Well,are you dating anyone? What do you think of erin? I mean,she's She's kinda cool. You think I can do better? I gotta get my goin' out on. Hey,let's watch this thing! Whoa! Oh,whoa,okay. Yeah,we're not watching this. How can we not watch this? What happened to "do not mock"? We're not mocking. We're watching. That will inevitably lead to mocking. Well,we'll deal with it as it comes. Is this the tape of me falling? Yes,put the dvd in. Open up quicktime. It starts on the song. No,use quicktime. Trust me,I've done this. Guys,michael can't handle this, and as your boss,I'm saying we're not watching it. No,it's okay. Watch it. He can't fire all of you. What are you doing? It's all right. I can handle it. No. I am a grown-up,jim. Shh! It's on. There they come. Boom! Did Did you see that? See what? Wait,why'd you stop it? Oscar,yes,you're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it. Jim,you let michael fall in. Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall. Oh,man. I think when I started to see you go in,I think I just froze. I don't think you froze. It's a killer new dance move. Do you want to talk in your office? no. I didn't ask you. Would you like to talk? Judas. Jim is my enemy, but it turns out that jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend, so jim is actually my friend. But because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy, so actually,jim is my enemy. But I should have grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look,I thought I could have done today's sales call alone. I mean,I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job. Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me. Hey,what's up,lifeguard? Oh,jim,I think I'm in your way. Oscar's a douche. No,he's all right. No,he's a Yeah,he's all right. Okay. - Thanks,michael. - You're welcome. Whoa! Almost fell. Hey,erin,do you mind faxing this for me? Oh,sure. Wait. Hand them to me upside down, so I don't accidentally read them. Okay. Thanks. Mm-hmm. How did today go by the way?Did you make any sales? No,it was a total waste of time. Um,it was fun,though, because I got to spend the day with andy bernard. He's really cool. Yeah,he is. Yeah,he is. He's like the coolest person I've ever met. That's Right. He's like marlon brando. Oh. Do you mean marlon wayans? 'cause he is. I actually do mean marlon wayans,yeah.
- Stanley? - Thank you. Oh,no,no,no. I got a pumpernickel just for you. H and h. You went all the way to new york city to get us bagels? Oh,why,is there a place closer that sells them? This was really nice,dwight. - Thanks. - Thanks. Oh,don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one. - Good morning,michael. - Good morning,dwight. Hungry? No.I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually,i had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers, because i guess i'm the only aphrodisiac she needs. Fish sticks are not an aaphrodisiac. You're thinking of deer penis. It worked. Regardless,that was over two hours ago, and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry--bagel? I don't mind if i do. Okay,i brought cheese too. I'm taking one for my lady friend. - Excellent. - Brain food. - Thank you very much. - Okay. You owe me. Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor, which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Jeez When did everyone get so cynical? Proudly Presents Season 6 Episode 8 Pam,would you care for a bagel? Oh,no,thank you. Oh,that's right,you're a woman,and you need to refuse food the first time.

Hello?Well,that's great. Turns out the paper was there all along. Oh,thank god. Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive. So,pammy,are you still liking sales? Yeah.It's exciting. Uh,you know,michael and i were talking, and maybe if you put in a little more face-to-face time with your clients, you could improve your sales. Pam's sales are fine,actually. Just want you to succeed,pammy. You know what?We shouldn't even be talking about business today. Thank you. Today's about family. Why did i get in the car? I could have struggled. I have a whistle in my purse.I didn't even blow it. Oh,dwight,i have a little surprise for you. Let me guess,you ate the bagel i gave you and loved it. Yes. And i wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers, and i happened to look over and notice that your briefcase was a little worse for the wear.

Thank you very much for that. - Have a seat.Please. - Have a seat yourself. You know what,i am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse. - Not necessary. - No,no,no.

I used to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh,maybe michael will start dating that too. What table should we take? So many to choose from. - Oh,my god! - What? All i see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh,wait a second! You mean this one? Michael,you did all this? It's not about taking credit.Let's just say we all did it. Well,thank you.All of you. Well,it was actually me alone,so. Wow,look at this place. It really makes me want to go to italy someday. Oh,you'll love it. You can have my guide books. I think i'm done with those really long plane rides. Oh,thank you for-- thanks for lending me the book. So,mom,which birthday are we celebrating this year? Oh,sticking with 49. That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition. That's funny. Well,as long as you're running numbers,pam,help me out with this one. Let's see,honey,you're six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days. So what does that add up to? Ooh,burn.Burn on you. And a little bit on me too. You're 54 years old. No,i'm 58. You're 58 years old? Congratulations. The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you. And i am not robbing the cradle. If anything,i am robbing the grave. Mom,have you decided what you want to be called? I like "nana." but i also like the classic "grandma." - please be grandma.I want you to be grandma. - Definitely a grandma. Michael,what do you think?Grandma? Grandma. Hey,would you guys ever do a triathlon,you think? Maybe. Helene? Oh,oh,no. I don't think so. I am. I'm definitely gonna do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. I just need to learn how to swim. Come on,you in? No,no,i think a triathlon is pretty much something i can rule out. It just doesn't interest me. So it's a matter of interest. Good.Okay. It's not anything you would have ever done. Mm,i might have done it when i was younger, but now there are just other things that i'd rather be doing than running and jumping. Well,there's no jumping in a triathlon. You're thinking the broad jump. Would you try - Bungee jumping? - No. - Snowboarding? - No,no. You want to go snowboarding? I might. Michael,what are you talking about? Nothing. Just life and Doing things Before you die. I don't know. Do i really want to go snowboarding? No. But i-- i would like to if i wanted to. What's going on in here? Andy bought lunch. Oh,no,really? Took a page right out of the old schrute book of niceness. There is no book.There's only a survival guide. You bought breakfast for everyone,so i got lunch for everyone. Okay,well,allow me. You know what-- gosh,these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos. So we should get the check? - What about your gift,michael? - Oh,no,no,no. No,it's stupid.You'd hate it.I hate it. - I'm sure i won't. - Yes,you will. He locked himself in his office all morning working on it. Oh,gimme!Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word "love" on it in every language! I literally--i put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well have been toilet paper. Toilet paper "a scrapbook of our first memories,"by michael gary scott. For my girlfriend helene on your birthday." that's just an arbitrary title. Okay,here's a penny. - What's that from? - Penny for your thoughts. It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in,and i went back later,waded in,and i found it. That's amazing! It's not amazing at all. It's sort of weird that i went and did that. And now your wish won't come true,so that blows. - A poem. - Oh,that i plagiarized,i think. "i cannot go to school today said little peggy ann mckay," - is that shel silverstein? - Yeah. "i have the measles and the mumps,a gash,a rash,and purple bumps, and my teacher's really mean-- happy birthday,i love you,helene." that's really nice,michael. Well,i think it sucks. I think it's wonderful.Absolutely wonderful. Well,that's because you and i have very different taste. And you like lame things. It's a generational sort of gap between us. God,a scrapbook. Home run,michael. - You set the bar so high. - That was a bunt. Whoa,whoa,whoa,dwight,i'm gonna do this. Hey,hey,hey,relax. I got it covered. - No,no,no. - No,i insist. Okay,dwight,this is ridiculous. Don't worry about it.You can just owe me. Hey,where'd you go? Oh,just went to the bathroom. And then you stopped at the bar on the way back? Got thirsty. Okay,weirdo. Come on,it's time for cake. Oh,okay. Honestly,for a long time i thought i was going to grow old with holly. And then i met helene,and she is great. And she already knows and has done everything that i have ever wanted to do, and can tell me about it. But i think i want to do those things myself. The cake's really good. Oh,i know. I love it when they use butter-cream frosting. Finish your cake,helene. I want you to enjoy that cake because i have something terrible i need to tell you, and i want you to enjoy your cake before i tell you this terrible,terrible thing. Al helene,i think you're a wonderful person, and i--god,i've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But i ve to consider pam's feelings. As a friend and a -worker, i cannot in good conscience continue to date you when i knowhat this is doing to her. Michael-- michael,it's--it's okay. No,it's n. I know that it took me a little while to come aund, and it's still a little ird to get used to,but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy. Wow,tt just-- u've really grown.

Boom! Boom boom! Broken nose!  Boom boom boom! Broken nose! Boom!  TOPTOPTHIS YEAR IN MARTIAL ARTS:    as we all know,the one thing  that thousand-year-old martial arts do all the time is change.  How can i pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the yakuza,  and you happen to be visiting the lackawanna trolley museum,  and you are attacked by triads.  How can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch.  Okay,so there's no defense for that? Good to know.  No,there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin,go!  No way. Last time,you pulled my pants down,  and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.  False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!  Okay,with all due respect to everyone here,  i think the most worthy opponent of you is you.  That is correct,unless there happen to be measles present.  So let's just say that dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now,how would you,dwight, defend against it?  Easy. Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. Block.  Grasp wrist as such.  And what if he comes at you with the other hand?  Because he does have two.  Good point. Second throat punch.  Absorb the blow.  Groin punch.  Hit,block,elbow to the gut!  Up to the nose! No,you're not!  Oh,my god,he's making you look like such a fool.  He really is,but not for long.  God! Instep!  Boh! Not again!  You let go! You let go!  Oh,you're right! I can't hold on!  You two are so evenly matched,i don't know how one of you's gonna get the upper hand.  The important thing to remember,jim,  we always have what is called the element of surprise.  Proudly Presents   the office 609  But i would say my favorite art form  is a tie between sculpting and stand-up comedy.  I did stand-up comedy once.  - You did? - Yeah,i killed.  - That sounds like it was hilarious. - It was hilarious.  - Michael? - Yes?  What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?  You'll have to be more specific,dwight.  I get like eight emails a day.  This one. "from: david wallace,to: all dunder mifflin.  " whoo-hoo. Shout-out.  "hello,everyone,i'm sure you've seen "the item in the journal.  "just want to stress it's all conjecture.  "if there's any concrete news,you will know a. S. A. P.  " erin,do we have the journal?  Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.  - Did you? - Michael,he means the wall street journal online.  Oh,the wall.  I found the article.  "on a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings,  "one that is relatively unsurprising "is dunder mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend de--"  and the article cuts off.  It's $1. 99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was gonna say.  Are you serious?  I got it,i got it.  Tuna beat me to it.  "it is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy"?  No,no. That doesn't make any sense.  Oh,lord,we're all gonna lose our jobs.  Not necessarily. Bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.  Oh,that sounds awful.  Or it could mean the end of dunder mifflin.  Oh,god! Well,that's an interesting theory.  You know what? You can all have jobs at schrute farms  As human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.  I'm sorry,michael. David's in a meeting.  Ah,well,maybe you should spy on him.  Oh,my god! Wouldn't that be hilarious?  um,i'll just have him call you back.  Okay,okay. Good.  I'll catch you on the flippity-flip. Bye!  He's busy. Call me back when he's free.  michael,are you okay? Did you throw up in there?  No,just poopin'. You know how i be.  But it smells like throw-up in here.  Crazy world,lotta smells.  You guys,what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  I like erin. There,i said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out,  but things have not panned out on that front,so  It is time for the nard-dog to take matters into his own paws.  We have to do something,  because people are losin' it out there,  wondering what's gonna happen.  Okay,we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Is there anything new in youtube?  - Michael-- - doesn't even need to be good.  Oh,god! I can't think. I need more mullins.  listen,wallace said these were just rumors,right?  So we have no reason to think that the company's anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work,  you and me,they'll follow along.  - Monkey see,monkey do. - That's it.  Monkey pee all over you.  That Rhymes.  So what have we on the docket today?  We have a  A monthly staff meeting.  All right! Let's conference room it up!  Here's the deal,guys. There is no new information as of yet,  so i suggest we all just keep working.  Sure,i'm a little nervous,but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.  Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  and as of now,there is no differentiation between the letter "o" and the zero,  but we are working on that.  Stay tuned for that.  He needs me. Seat-save infinity.  - Okay,great. - Oh,god!  What?  Oh,my god.  - What? - What is it?  Is there news?  There has been a murder!  - What? - A mur-- -what?  There's been a murder In savannah.  Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  "battleship" got me through my parents' divorce.  "operation" got me through my vasectomy,i. E. My operation.  I don't think i would have been able to  endure my break-up with holly had it not been for "toss across.  "belles,bourbon,and bullets,  a murder mystery dinner party game.  it is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character,we go around the room,  we try to figure out who did it.  Hey,i'm wondering if this is a,um,terrible idea.  This is my call,jim. Big picture stuff. It's about murder.  I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.  Tube city. You owe me one.  Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that i picked  was to stop michael from running plastic tubes  all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was gonna call it tube city.  So,yes,i do owe him one.  august 5,1955.  it's a sad day down here in savannah.  Local magnate bill bourbon was killed last night,  and all y'all have congregated tonight for a meal  to celebrate bill as he passes on to his great reward.  But you're not just here to pay your respects.  You have to figure out which of y'all  is the no-account scoundrel who killed him.  This is ridiculous.  There will be food. You leave,you do not get food.  - What kind of food? - Sandwich platters.  - I'm in. - Baby carrots.  Okay,here are your character cards.  Take one,pass it down.  Here is your prop box.  Some of your characters will have props.  Now,on your character card,  it tells you who you are and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So if you talk slowly in real life,your character could,  say,have been kicked in the head by a horse.  Cool. I'll try it.  Okay. Use your imaginations.  Who did you get?  "naughty nellie nutmeg,  a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.  - ooh! Saucy. - How about you?  "nathaniel nutmeg,the local bartender and  Nellie's brother.  michael,i don't like this game. It's scary.  It's not scary.  I don't like my character.  Who are you?  "voodoo mama juju,the witch doctor of the savannah swamps.  " i'm not comfortable with this.  Well,how do you think i feel?  I mean,i have to play caleb crawdad,handsome playboy.  Every night,a different woman,  being oogled,having to hug and kiss and spoon.  Oh! I make them feel beautiful.  Well,well,well!  What is this contraption,i do declare?  It's my blackberry,michael. I'm trying to get updates on the company.  Who's michael? I'm caleb crawdad,i do declare.  You don't have to keep saying,"i do declare.  " anytime you say something it means you're declaring.  That is the way southern people talk.  And what designing woman are you basing that on?  Delta burke,i do declare.  Now,shall we get to the mystery?  I'll go.  "my name is deborah utante,deb for short.  that's clever. Debutante.  "bill bourbon was my uncle.  "i would have never hurt him any more than i'd hurt a june bug.  nice accent. You sound like forrest gump.  - I do not. - Well,you do,actually.  You got this kind of like florida panhandle thing goin',  whereas what you really want is more of a savannah accent,  which is more like molasses,just sort of spillin' out of your mouth.  Oh,now do the swedish chef.  Uh,i'm not familiar. What province is he from?  He lives on sesame street,dumbass.  You know,i think i'm supposed to say something to pam-- i mean,deb. Okay.  Um "i overheard you askin' the butler where the pistol was kept.  wait a minute! Wait a minute!  I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? Oh,you rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!  No,no,no. Don't turn this into a political thing.  I will poison your food.  I reckon i got somethin' to say  to miss beatrix bourbon if'n she don't mind.  Ooh,doggy! We got a party now!  I do believe that the game is a big hit.  People are really divin' into their characters.  Y'all  i made a mistake.  Sorry i'm late,boss. What's goin' on?  Sir,there has been a murder,and you are a suspect.  Okay. Hang on just a second.  Let me settle in,and i'll be right back.  Very good! Very good!  Now,no one was there in the wine cellar.  - hey,there,young lady. - Hello.  I would be remiss if i did not ask the pretty young lady  out on a date for this weekend.  Sounds like a plan,sugar.  All right!  A plan it is.  voodoo mama juju,explain your dalliance with the dark arts.  It's not my fault. I was exposed to harry potter.  I know you did it!  I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect.  It's also never the person you least suspect,  since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore,i know the killer to be phyllis,  a.K.A.Beatrix bourbon,  the person i most medium suspect.  Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.  Well,you know old nellie is always up for a romp in the hay.  How 'bout a threesome?  Yeah. My boudoir's always open.  Nice.  I'm a little worried i might have asked out naughty nellie and not erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing,  because naughty nellie says yes to everyone,  and she might be a murderer.  Follow before  i just got an email from corporate,  specifically for accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.  What does that mean?  Well,maybe nothing,but it could be a prob--  What's this strange yankee accent comin' out of your mouth,son?  This here is savannah.  Phyllis,uh  Uh This  Uh,plan--planta-- this plantation,  we're runnin' low on,uh,greenbacks,  and we're havin' problems payin' the people  who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay 'em.  Michael,i can't-- basically,  it could mean a lot of things,  but it is unprecedented,  so it's cause for concern.  Okay,i'm going back to work.  No. No,no. No. No.  No,no,i'm gonna skip forward to a really big clue. Here we go.  Narrator on cd: well,by now,you figured  out that old beatrix bourbon was the killer.  What?  Michael,i was doing so well.  Are you goin' to believe that?  That is a mis-- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  Nellie nutmeg,come back in heyah!  I can't do this mahself.  Voodoo mama juju!  What am i gonna do?  Okay,so corporate is still in their meeting.  That could be a good sign.  Hey,everyone,kevin's gonna give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.  All right,guys,it's a workday,  and you guys work here,so let's go do some work.  Now,jim telling us all to work,  i think that is a very good sign.  Don't just say things.  oh,good,michael.  Listen,i wrote up those sales targets-- -  i do believe you have me mistaken.  My name is caleb crawdad.  Y'all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to re-open this case.  No,you're not re-opening the case. The case is closed.  No,it ain't.  Frankly,i'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.  i was just thinking about weekend at bernie's.  So funny. The guy's dead the whole time.  I haven't seen it.  Speaking of weekends,you excited about our date this weekend?  Of course,nathaniel.  Okay.  Where are you takin' me?  Well  The finest steakhouse in all savannah.  Savannah?  That's a far way from scranton.  Did you mean a real date?  No.  - Did you? - Totally not.  I thought it was for real  So i was excited,but it was just-- it was part of the game.  You're sure it was water?  It couldn't have been acid?  I already declared you it was too dark to tell!  Stop playing games with me,crawdad!  This is not a game! This is my life!  - You are out of order,sir! - Answer me!  - You are out of order! - You are out of order!  - You are out-- - i think michael may have snapped.  Or maybe he's just stuck in character.  Well,which is worse? Snapped or stuck?  Both. They're both worse.  It's gonna be all right. We're a good company.  We'll figure this out.  We're not going under.  Jim,what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this  all ends up fine,and i can't think of one.  Deb,what in the world? Do you have the vapors?  Michael! Not now.  Can't wait. We have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on. come on!  I should just go.  Where to now,caleb?  To mama juju boo-boo.  Michael,can i--  okay,i'm just gonna skip right past the what and go with why?  Because this is the re-creation of a crime scene.  I'm the dead body,and these are my brain chunks.  Hey,shut up. You're dead.  Michael,can i talk to you in your office?  - No michael here. - Caleb!  - Today,of all days-- - no! You shut up!  They need this game,jim.  Let us have this stupid little game,all right?  You startled me!  My stars,my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can i do you for?  Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.  - Detective wallace? - I don't think so.  I think it's david wallace from dunder mifflin.  Aw,shucks. Tell him i'm not heyah.  You're not gonna answer the phone?  No,i only answer to detective wallace,  'cause i got a warm body in the other room.  I'll take it.  - Hey,david. - Hey.  Sorry to be gettin' back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear.  We didn't officially decide anything yet.  Oh,okay.  But if i can be candid with you here,jim  It's not good. We fully expect to be out of money  by the end of the year-- insolvent.  So Well,you know what?  I'm sorry. I have to run.  - But we will talk soon,okay? - Sure. Okay.  Oh,you know,while i have you,  - today i was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain - great.  And it would actually be a big account.  Okay,look,you know what?  I can't really get my head around anything  like that right now,but that's great.  Keep after it,but i gotta run.  - Okay. - Thanks,jim. - See ya.  What's the news?  Nothing yet.  Well,i guess that's not  well,there is some bad news.  There has been another murder.  A murder,you say?  I do declare.  Conference room,everyone.  Do we have to play?  - No. - Super.  Oh,this could be a juicy one.  Get in there! Get in there!  I think today was a good day to have two managers,  because if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat  in the middle of the ocean,  one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game,  it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And i get that now.  There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  Today is the hardest i have worked in a long,long time.  - I didn't do it! - Okay.  - ever'body just calm down. - I am calm.  Count of three,we're all gonna put down our guns.  I have crossbows.  - We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three. - Okay.  - You ready? - I'm ready.  One Two two.  Three. Three.  andy revealed himself to be a double agent,  at which point,dwight felt comfortable revealing  that he also was a double agent,  and then,michael announced to everybody that,  get this,he was a double agent.  Oh,and it is 6:00.  really?  It wasn't me!  I'm not goin' down for this!  Hey,i want to go home.  Get the keys out of my purse,start the car.  Proudly Presents   the office 609
Not again. Bow down before recyclops. Five years ago,corporate said we had to start a recycling program for earth day. So dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named recyclops. Happy earth day,everyone,i'm recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter? The next year he really stepped things up. Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin? A year after that,recyclops really began to take shape. Recyclops will drown you in your overwatered lawns. Then tragedy struck recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing. I can't remember. Recyclops will have his revenge. I think this was also the year that he renounced earth day and vowed to destroy the planet he once loved. Oh,my god,you guys,look,it's recyclops! Recyclops destroys! - Oh,is today recyclops day? - Yes. I thought you were killed by polluticorn or something. Polluticorn wishes. That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for th environment. Humans are terrible for the environment. The thing I like most about recyclops ishat he's creating a different world for our child. A world where you truly can be anything you want. God bless you,recyclops and your cold robot heart. Okay,okay,how about this? - That's great. - I want it to be better than great,pam. How about I remain seated and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. Sure. No,then my face is down and they can't see my face. And it looks like you're taking a dump. Alan brand is the ceo of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to new york to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then michael scott turns and waves to the crowd and the crowd goes wild. Ladies and gentleman,from scranton pennsylvania, please welcome michael "the machine" scott. - Don't do the twirl. - Lose the twirl. - Twirl sucks. - Michael,I hated the twirl. Hate the twirl. Okay,obviously,I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it cacause I nailed the wave. Yeah,good,don't do it. I'm not going to do the twirl. All right? It's not even a twirl,it's a spin. I might do the spin. The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's nowhere to get it. Okay,oscar,I don't need the whole enchilada just bullet points. Those are the bullet points. Well,could you condense it please? That's as simple as I can make it. Michael,the limo's here for you. It's not a limo,it's a town car. Town car's are actually better though, better torque,better handling. He said limousine so Check it out,guys. There's a limo down here. Michael,look. Oh,man. They sent a limo. Town cars suck. A town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cse for celebration. And in this case,I think we are celebrating me. Oh,wait! Wait! wo Wow! Ohoh,no way. Look at that. What kind of mileage does this baby get? It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows. This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Uh,they're a bunch of boobs. Hate to break it to you,oscar,but some of us like boobs. Calves,calves all the way. I'i'm so jealous right now. Hey,you know who you should be jealousf? Yourself because you're invited,and you're invited, and you're invited,and you,and you,and you,and you,and you,and you Car seats eight. And you - What? - The car seats eight. The limo seats eight. Okay,then jim and pam,and ryan plus a guest. - No thanks. - no. I'll use it when you're done. I'll go me. The dunder mifflin stock symbol is dmi. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies,morons and idiots because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And as one of those idiots,I believe the board owes me answers. I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here. Hey guys,do you thinknynyone might have had sex in here? - Definitely. - Sounds like it. Definitely. Look,they got pillows. That,that's bigger than my bed. - Word! - Yeah,yeah! Who's playing with the button? Hey,ryan,could you start consolidating all of our rolodex information into outlook? Uh,itoeoesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under. But if the company doesn't go under, then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program. - The company's probably going under though. - It could go either way. Seems like it's leaning one way. Maybe we should just wait and find out - definitely. - Okay. So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff? Nah,might as well do it now. Michael,what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave or what? I will have to answer. I'll ask you a question. Make it a softball. Something he can,like,crank out of the park. Michael scott,you run ththe most profitable branch of dunder mifflin,how do you do it? No,no,that's too hard. Say you're name is zamboni and I will say, "well,we're sort of on thin ice. " I won't say that,i'll say something like that. This is your big day,come on. Oh,my god. This is it. - Mr. Scott? - Yes. - I'm laurie. - Oh,hi. Thank you for joining us. Come with me. Well,thank you and please call me Continue to call me mr. Scott. Okay. If you just wanna follow me i'll take you up to the lounge. Well,I guess that's as far as I can take yoguys. So - Good luck,michael. - See you later. Officers. Thank you. - Here is the lounge. - Thank you. - Michael. - Hello. - So glad you could make it. - Thank you. - How was the ride? - Oh,it was awesome. Very,very sublime. I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. Uh,first we'll start with alan brand. Alan,ceo,michael scott,branch manager,scranton. - It's nice to meet you michael. - Nice to meet you too. It's an honor and a privilege. And seated we have the former congressman chris o'keefe. Ah,your eminence. For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the isle. Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. H,h,damn it. What Okay. I was hoping to lob michael a soft ball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district and pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy. Can you believe this? The money theypent on this convention hall. Excuse me,miss. I just want to take those stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple. Oh,yeah. Well,you should do that. Get in line. Oh,what a great idea and lose my job. No,thank you. Look,don't you wanna be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during america's biggest financial crisis? How is he gonna have grandkids? You guys ever protect the president? no. What about madonna? Obama twins? Anybody famous? Not supposed to talk about it. Nelly furtado. All right,guys. Are you ready? Rock and roll all: boo!  Company. We are poised to come through this more streamlin a and profitable than ever. This is not as much fun as I thoug I it would be. It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy. We're going bankrupt,you think? They are really angry. I'm just gonna run to the bathroom,will you save my place? - Sure. - no. You will not. Excuse me? Oh,I'm sorry,were you raised in a household with no consequences? It'll just be a second. Oh,if onlys and justs were candies and nuts then everyday would be erntedankfest. There are many things to be optimistic about in dunder mifflin's future. And one of them is here with us today. Michael scott,scranton branch manager. Yes! In these uncertain times michael has managed to maintain steady profits from the scranton branch. We all thank you,michael. Another bright spot in the dunder mifflin landscape our new waste-pulp re-purposing plant in milford. Hey,phyllis,are you just getting back from lunch now? Bob took me to capello's. We got a little tipsy. Okay,shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me. Oh,it's okay,michael esesn't really care about these things. I care about 'em and I'm just as much of a boss as michael. What's so funny? I'm a co-manager. That doesn't make you a boss. It's not like you can fire people or anything. Well,who How did you Who told you this? - We can't say. - Ryan. Sorry,I'm plastered. Okay,who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as michael? Stuff gets around. I don't participate. Who here heard it from ryan? Does an email count? - Yes. - Then yeah. I am just as much of a boss as michael and I can do anything that michael can do. All right. Who here believes that I have as much power as michael? I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one. These questions are bush league. You should get up and say something. You gotta be true to what's in there. Don't be a wuss. I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school,I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students j just skip the sats. At the last second I chickened out,took it anyway,got a 1220. Always regretted it. I feel lachrymose. Believe me,everyone is working very hard, working weekends,struggling,trying to right the ship. You're criminals! Hey,hey! I'm sorry these are not criminals. They're nice. They invited me to come here today, they invited me to their hospitality suite, where I had free food,and it was delicious. Get this,you know how nice they are? They sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in scranton. - Limousine? - Yes. You're all corrupt. You should be in jail! Quiet! Quiet,please! Please,quiet! Quiet,please. We want to hear your questions. Do you love her,or do you love the idea of her? I don't know,man. I just don't know. I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him? Can you actually fire people? To be honest,I don't know. But maybe I could just yell at him in front of people. Well,I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone. Oh,I yell. You've heard me yell. Okay. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said,"hey look,we parked over here. " well,that was apple picking day. There's no need to yell that day. You know,I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day. Well,you'll figure it out. Okay,we're gonna take a 15-minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions. You haven't said anything yet and we're headed rr bankruptcy. Yeah,well,that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with se answers. What? What answers? I Okay,I know,that you're mad at me and you're mad at all of them How are you gonna fix the company? Okay All right,we are gonna We're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45-day plan. Yeah! It's a One point per day We get 45 points we're back in business. And you can take that to the bank. And limo lady,we are going completely carbon neutral. I love you,new york!  How's it go Here's the thing,um,I've tried it like five different ways in my head and Oh,got one,um,I'm such a perfectionist that I'd kinda rather not do it at all,than do a crappy version. Simple data entry though,so there's really only oneay to do it. Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna,maybe,just take a whack at it? - You know what? - What? - I think I know the problem. - Great. I think you seem distracted. Yep,that is the problem. And you know what,I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help. Well,I'm glad you're finally being proactive,jim. I am too. Let me show you. Wow,things are really picking up. - What was that about? - What? You were suppose to wave. I did wave. I did a lot more than wave. What are we suppose to tell them now? Okay,you've dug us quite a hole. We tell them the plan. Right? There is no plan. Here's what we're gonna do. The 45-day thing that I outlined,we go with that. Day 45 company saved. Day 44,go. What have we got? We have 15 minutes. Excuse me? Just whatever comes to mind,shout it out. Who the hell is this guy? I am the guy who roused that crowed - Yes - Got 'em on their feet. - They were so happy down there. - Yes. Who cares? Okay,all right. Well,I know a guy This mexican guy. Is a math whiz,he knows economics as well as he knows bullfighting and I am going to call in a little favor. No,no,don't call anybody,michael. Well,I'm texting him so Please do not text anybody now. Michael. It's done. Oh,there he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman,I would like u to meet oscar Come on in. Don't be shy. This is oscar martinez. Oscar,why don't you come over here? Let me present you. Step up,step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky murky situation. Take it away. I think this is really gonna help. If you can just hold up here one second. Hey,guys,just a quick announcement. If I could have everyone's attention. I just figured you needed a place where you could concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people. - Okay. - Let me show you what I mean. Your new office. How great is that,right? For a job well done. Well Not done. I will,uh,I will do my work right now. - I will stay late tonight. - Right. Um,I'm very sorry about everything. You're a good kid.

And the dumping of properties and this is all It's all good,it's all good stuff. Lay it on 'em. I feel,as does Mr. Scott,that we are in the best of hands,uh,capable hands That wasn't what you were sayin' to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. - Much better. - I think this has gone very well. I And I thank you. Okay Hey,hey. What are you doing? Michael,I didn'ask to come up here. Wow,man,that That was embarrassing. - For me. - For me too. - For you? - You embarrassed me. You Well That was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking, I go down there,maybe rattle off a few jokes congressman could follow. He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron? Uh,I'm not a moron. Time after time,my branch leads in sales, I have personally won over 17 dundee awards,so I am not a moron. And I'm just trying to help,you know,so you're the moron. Yes,it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say,"wow,great job. That's what it's about. " he canaake the bus. He's had his limo ride. That is what it's all about,not the perks. The perks The perks,I could take or leave the perks. Oscar! Oscar,come on! But limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. Woo-hoo! Go,go,go,go,go,go,go! Go,go,go! Did you steaththat? After all,we are the only ones with anything to celebrate. All: scranton,scranton,scranton,scranton! Dunder mifflin! Gentlemen in the glasses. Dwight Schrute. Scranton branch. I just wanna say that I've been standing in this line all day, and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run, then we are in big trouble. Thank you. I know. And I just wanna say that I believe that there are options out there a taken number option like they have in a dale. What about line varieties like an express line. For quick comments of ten words are less, they can move much more officiantly. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to. Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions. Yes.
You wanted to see me? Yeah. Have a seat. Is it serious? - Andy's a wittle scawed. - Okay,right there. Right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk. Why would people say that? Well,I have it on good authority that you said the following. Can you read that back to me? "Andy have a boo-boo tummy. Would you rather me say "hey,guys,my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up"? - Okay. - "Crazy diarrhea happening right now." 'cause things can get real adult,real fast. You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "num nums," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widicuwous," and "wode iwand." Do I sometimes replace rs with ws? Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well,if I do,andy's sowwy. You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies. Well,if we're complaining, a lot of people think your elvis voice is annoying - okay,who said that? - I don't Just people. For the record,I think it's pretty fantastic. Well,thank you. Thank you a lot. And for what it's worth,I think your baby voice is tops. - Tank you,Mr. Elwis. -  Tuna,md,I have some terrible news. Wait,are you the patient or the doctor? The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the mondays. What do you put our chances at? Unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant,stat! - Sounds risky. - Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the month. Every awesome place I've worked had one. Bear stearns. Lehman brothers. Aig. My summer at enron. Wow,that's not such a bad idea. Great! Anything else? Nope. Frankie's dirty joke of the day? - There's a bunch of those. - Keep. There's a bunch of sent emails that just say "delivered. " Should I delete all those? I want to keep those so I can see what I sent. - That's why you have a "sent mail" folder. - Keep. - There's about 30 news alerts for "nip slip. - " For what? - "Nip slip. - " Oh,okay. I don't know how those get there. - Well - Must be hackers. What's up? What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend? Did you murder someone? - Worse than that. - Oh,my god. Lurk much? I Miss pam. I think she's okay. Is that what we're going for now? "okay"? We used to go for "pretty good. " Great. Hey,how do you feel about starting an employee of the month program? Yeah. You know what,that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies,but You're not in it at all 'cause you can't be employee of the month,you're a manager. Well,technically,I am a co-manager. And I barely have any responsibilities. But I work hard,I love this company,and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month. It would look bad. Sorry. It would look good on my mantle. jim's talking to michael right now ? they totally went for our idea. Yeah! Your idea. My idea. I just need andy to think it's his idea so it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, jim will get a phone call from david wallace. He will be fired. Hey,pam,do you have a sec to check over this itinerary? - Looks great. - Oh,did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't. Okay. The michael scott foundation is still in existence. There you are. I don't think we have finished with my inbox. What's "scott's tots"? Has it really been ten years? "local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders. " Michael,why did you promise that? To change lives. No,michael,why would you promise that? Yeah,okay,I Call the school. Cancel. I can't go through with this. We've already rescheduled seven times. Michael,this is a terrible,terrible thing you've done. - Well It's terrible. - No. Just terrible. And the longer you put it off,the worse it's gonna get. I just I fell in love with these kids. And I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system. So I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down,that was the most generous. Just tell me it is going to be okay,all right? - No! - I'm not a bad news person. I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids i'd pay for college. Okay. All right. You have to tell them. Would you come with me? You know,like old times instead of I can print out a new itinerary with pam's name on it. It's fine. Erin,you're going to go. And you're going to make sure michael tells the truth. Agh,god,you know what,could this day get any worse? Hey,jimmy,what's up? - Not much. - Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried,you uld grow the best beard of anyone in this office. Thanks,dwight. - That laugh is so infectious. - You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go. I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same thing from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole employee of the month situation in the bud. Make it about the work. Let me guess,you think you should get it. This encompasses all available data. Hours. Tardiness. Unconfirmed sick days. Participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also,this should be accompanied by a monetary prize. Well,in an ideal world In an ideal world,I would have all ten fgers on my left hand so my right hand could just be a fist for punching. Okay,if it's all the same to you, i'm just gonna take away "survival skills" and "self-defense. " I'm gonna run this by toby in accounting and have him assemble the data. That's okay. I'll do it. Mr. Scott. Hey,mikela lasker. - How are you? - I'm good. Good to see you. Where's your saxophone? It's in the music room,Mr. Scott. Eighth grade graduation,she gave a rendition of when the saints go marn that would blow your freaking mind. Well,you didn't even hear it. - Everyone's so excited that you're here today. - Oh,good. Now,I know you probably want to see everyone, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions first. - Sure. - You're famous. the  - I'm sure you remember this place. - Oh,ye. - Do you want to go in? - No,not at all. Nope. Come on. Oh,you know what,you know what,I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy. I should We just want to say thanks. Mr. Scott,I know you're a busy man and your schedule moves around a lot, but through all your generosity through the years,your tots, who are ready to graduate, thought it was time to give you a proper thank you. hey,Mr. Scott ? what you gonna do? what you gonna do? Make our dreams come true ? hey,Mr. Scott,what you gonna do? what you gonna do? Make our dreams come true ? you came into our lives and made a promise ? that made us honest,made us realize ? we don't need to compromise 'cause we can have it all ? 'cause you made it possible ? for us to achieve the improbable ? hey,Mr. Scott,what you gonna do? what you gonna do? Make our dreams come true ? hey,so jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in So jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a twenty for this whole employee of the month thing. Jim said that? He thought you were doing an incredible job last month. Jim said that? You seem surprised. No,no. That makes total sense. - Hey,buddy. - Sure. So every Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule. Politicians are always coming around telling us they're going to fix our schools. Promising this and that. But you,Mr. Scott You are actually doing it. You have taught these kids, with hard work that anything is possible. You are a dream maker. And I thank you. I thank you. So much. There were a lot of times over the years where I was pressured to get into the drug game. But I always thought back to my guardian angel And the gift that you gave me. So I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college, educate myself,and become the next president obama. Oh,god. Oh,god. Okay,ladies and gentlemen,welcome. I know you're all very excited. But no matter who gets this, I just wanted to say that you guys are all employees of the month in my eyes. And the winner is employee number nine. And that is? Number nine,number nine. Jim halpert. What? - Are you kidding me? - Oh,no. Okay,wait,I was not I did not I did not. That was not. How come not? Guys,listen,this was anonymous,all right? There's no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score. To my tally,you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day,and a nice,tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us. Will everybody just stop for a second, 'cause obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all,there was no cash prize. - Yes. - Dwight? Yeah,you said "in an ideal world, there would be a cash prize. " Isn't that what you said? No,dwight,I meant "yes,in a perfect world, someone would get money,but not " yeah,but in your perfect world,only you get money. Let's put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour,Mr. Michael scott. All right. Um,I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives, like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "a" gym and "b" gym,that sort of thing? Show of hands. Anybody. Yes. Bunch of you. Okay. Well,me too. I've done something stupid,whh I would like to share. Um Should we go? Oh,no. We're okay. It's a It's a double period. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition. And tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay. You're gonna make me say it. All right,I am so proud of all of you. Derrick,and lefervre,and And ben,and ayana,and mikela,and nikki,and jason,and I'm Sorry,okay. Sorry. Spacing. Your name. I'm zion. I'm mikela's younger brother. Well,zion,I am not going to be paying for your tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so,so sorry. - You're kidding. - Excuse me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You lied to us. I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30,but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40. But by 40,I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s,I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil dreams. Some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place. You owe this to us. Okay,hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. Which is rendered useless without batteries. And I have one for each of you. Hey,hold Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. They're lithium. Look,there was a big mistake,obviously,so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway. Correction. It was my idea. - Okay. - My idea. Guys,I'm starting to think pam's not even pregnant. Okay. For the record,I am pregnant. And,obviously,there's been some kind of a mistake. So why doesn't jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on. - Yeah. Okay. - That's fair. - Fine. - Excellent idea,pam. - Thank you. That would be employee number three,which is Son of a bitch! Pam halpert. How is that possible? No offense,pam. But how the hell is tt possible? There must be some reasonable explanation for this. No,wait,come on. I - I didn't Miss a day. I came in early. I stayed late. And I doubled my sales last month. Oh,really,from what,two to four? yep. Guys,this isn't some elaborate scam,okay? Hi,I have an order here for a custom cake,jim halpert. Okay. That is me,but I didn't order the cake. - Look who it is. - "It could only be you. - " Way to go. - He knew all along. David wallace's office. This is kevin malone. Is david there? No,he's in his weekly staff meeting. Can I take a message? Tellim I'm mad at jim, 'cause he's asking us to give money to pam. This is stanley hudson. Jim halpert is a menace. It's toby flenderson. Listen,things are getting really bad down here. Hey,Mr. Scott. Erin,can you give us a second? That was messed up what you did. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I know. I know. I'm sorry. Who does something like that? Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn't come through like that? What can I do? You can pay for my college. I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this If you can find a way to pay for your tuition, let me buy your books,okay? They're expensive. Yeah,well,I owe you that at least,right? It's about $1,000. Really. That's That's over $200 a year. No,$1,000 each year. For Okay. Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do, i'm gonna write four checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now,you are to use one check a year. - And please call me before you cash the check. - Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause I've got monies to move around,okay? Make it out to my mom,ros that's a lot of zeroes. - This is jim. - Jim,what the hell is happening there? - Hey,uh,david. - Yes. So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild. Uh,but I am on it. Just so I understand,you started employee of the month, give it to yourself,then people complain, so you give it to your wife? - No. - Am I missing something? I really don't know how it happened,david. I know how it happened. Jim,I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that,we're gonna have a separate discussion. All right,it will not happen again. I promise. Uh,hey,I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you. No. It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job,right? - What? - Yeah. Thank you. - No. - Okay. Hey,we still on for dinner this weekend? - What? - Yes. Okay. - Oh,you're kidding me! - See you. Damn it! hey,Mr. Scott,what you gonna do? what you gonna do? Make our dreams come true ? hey,Mr. Scott,what you gonna do? please stop. I destroyed 15 young lives today. - No. - Yes. No. There's financial aid. Uh,they could join the army or the navy. You're what,like,12? The principal told me that 90% of scott's tots are on track to graduate and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think that if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out, which is something to think about,I think. I think you're doing a great job. Really? What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business? I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant. - Really? - Yes. But I'm terrible at math so You know,when I hired kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse. - Seriously? - Yeah. I just sort of had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too. hey,Mr. Scott,what you gonnao? what you gonna do? Make our dreams come true ? hey,Mr. Scott,what you gonna do? what you gonna do? Make our dreams come true ? yeah. see you tomorrow,dwight. Apparently. - How's it going? Good day? - Not now,temp. Um,okay. So,um,listen. I know about your diabolical plan. What? Diabolical plan?  I found a copy of it hin the copier tray. So what do you want? I want the same thing you want. I want to take jim halpert down. I want in.
- Attention, everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of - Too loud. - The party planning committee, - Too too loud, too loud. - Have an annou-- But effective. Look. On behalf of jim and I, Merry christmas. Merry christmas. - Good. - My diabolical plot is on hold for christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Not really. I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed. It is time to unveil the tree. - Hey, rockefeller center. - Yeah. - Uh, I've actually been to rock center, And this is nothing like that. - This is all we have. - Ugh. - Nope, it's not "ugh." It is office camaraderie. - It is warm feelings. - Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it? - 30, 29, 28 - Why would you start so high? - 27 - 3, 2, 1 - 26 - Ooh. - Ah. - You didn't decorate it. - No, exactly. - We didn't, because we think It would be better to do it together. - Everyone. - Why would you wrap it in a sheet If you're not covering anything up? - Is--is it fake? - Pam. - Yes! We are unveiling an artificial tree. That will never die - Yes. - Like the spirit of christmas. - And we're supposed to applaud you For you taking a giant diaper off a fake tree? - This was a successful unveiling. Go back to work! Merry christmas. - Hello. Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right To make announcements yet, But whoever is giving me the twelve days of christmas As my secret santa, Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove. The french hens have started pulling out my hair To make a nest. Please stop. - What psycho would send that as a gift? - I begged dwight and jim To give me erin for secret santa. And I decided to give erin the twelve days of christmas. Bowtie time. Is it my fault that the first eight days There's basically - Ho, ho, ho! Merry christmas, boys and girls. It's me, santa claus. - Hey, santa. - They finally let you do it. - Congrats, phyl. - It's so edgy. - I have been wanting to be santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament And the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to jim And he said I could do it. ohIt's been a long journey But I'm santa claus! - So, santa, what can we expect from this party? - It's going to be a very jolly time If you've been good. - What if you've been bad? - Oh, then nothing but a lump of coal for you. - What if you've been really, really bad? More "evil" than strictly "wrong." - Hey, creed, we covered it. Lump of coal. - For the past several weeks, My secret santa has been giving me pieces of a machine That I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this, Because I had the exact same idea For catching osama bin laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it To find himself In jail! - You know, oscar, every time I make this lasagna, People ask me if it's a family recipe. But reallyI just get the recipe from the box. - That's funny. - Is it funny? I thought it was more Interesting than funny. I think my water just broke. - That's too funny. - Oscar and the warehouse guy. Go, oscar! Go, gay warehouse guy! - Here'sSanta! Hey, little girl, what would you like for christmas? Ooh!

Where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last christmas that we have here. Doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious Me not playing santa? Come on! - I'm not gonna go tell phyllis that she can't be santa. - Fine. Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can You know what? I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those. If this were russia, yeah. Sure, everybody would go to one santa. And there would be a line around the block, And once you sat on her lap And she asked you what you wanted, You would say, probably, "freedom" At which point the kgb would arrest you And send you to siberia. It's a good thing russia doesn't exist anymore. Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! Why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there When you can sit on my lap? Phyllis is only pretending to be a man. I'm the real thing! Sit down on my lap, and there will be no doubt! No, it's not, like, penis-wise. Hello, little boy! What's your name? - Michael, it's me, kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap. - Oh, I am so sorry that phyllis hates you And hates your body. But santa remembers a reindeer That was just a tiny bit different as well. - When can I sit on your lap? - Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go! oh, my god. - It's really comfortable. what would you like for christmas, little boy? - I don't know.

Come on. - What about if I tell you the things I don't want? - Okay--get off! Get off! Off! oh, jee--god! - I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted. - Okay, you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you So santa doesn't have to go through this again. oh! - Awesome. - Well? - I'm trying, phyllis. You're santa. - The only santa. - That's what I want. - You promised me this. Don't make me get bob involved. - What would bob do? - Never mind. I shouldn't have said that. - Does it hurt? - It stings a lot. - Ehh. - I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts. - I know, right? - So far, no one will admit to it. Is it you? - yeah! Totally. I admit it. It's me. - Oh. Seriously? - Seriously? are you serious? - Is--what--you-- - Yeah. Totally serious. I'm your secret santa.

And there are women-- - who wants phyllis as santa? - No, no, no! Wait! No! There are other choices. There's information that we-- are you kidding me, kevin? After you almost killed me? - Michael, I had you. I just wanna try phyllis. - And if you want michael as santa, raise your hand. Can I get you some punch? - I--no. I'll get some punch. - Oh! - Michael! - Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger. - How do you know it's a gun? - What else does it look like? - Not a gun. - Well, I don't have all the pieces yet. - Well, unless the missing pieces is a gun, You don't have a gun. Not a gun. - In the north pole, I spend many nights alone Tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle In old kris kringle's eye.

Hey. Uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with h.R. So Well, I think I'm gonna be here for a while. This is a building where friends become lovers, And lovers become sexually interactive.

We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high By all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into. Turns out a lot of parents Want the very best for their children. That's weird. We're hoping our interview seals the deal. But if not, there's always the army. The infantry. Okay. Okay. - Mm. - Yeah. So you've just been bought by sabre. You've probly got a lot of questions. Hi. I'm christian slater. What's it like to work for sabre? Let's find out together. Working at sabre means taking on the challenge Of the road that rises to meet you. Sabre is respecting the past, But opening e window to the future. Have you ever tasted a rainbow? At sabre, you will. You'll find it easy to embrace the sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you. So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, "what's going on?" Well, you're not alone. Wow. Really terrific. Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, But as printer salesmen Who also sell paper. Perfect. No. Don't like that. At sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free To express your thoughts, your Talk about vacation days. We have a policy here at sabre Where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks. But I banked six weeks. I already booked a great lakes cruise. Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff? Actually, that's nick. He's your new I.T. Guy. Uh, he's setting up a site-blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites. And then there are the time-wasting sites Like twitter, youtube. We are blocking those as well. Mm, nope. Don't like that. Okay, did everyone get one? With these bottles, We eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, Which are the scourge of the environment. We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right? Little cups? Like paper or plastic or? I don't know what they're made of. They're two-ounce paper cups Dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day. Okay, well, I bet you Can fit 20 little cups of water In your aluminum bottle. You know what can't fit in a bottle Are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, And the 20 little scans I do of everybody To make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley. That's okay. There is a small part of me That is actually very excited about this new company. But 70% of me is water, And the other part, the real part, The part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts And makes decisions, And, if I can be crass, makes babies, That part thinks that all of these changes Suck ba Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach? What? Looks like we kicked it. I miss the old dunder mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate. I don't want to appear ungrateful For everything sabre's doing for us. Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, Because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, But I'm I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head Around a couple of 'em. Which ones? All of 'em. Well, I wish that I could do something, But it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know? So maybe we should call We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups? You know what? Let me see what I can do. Okay, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies. There's a finger-painting station And a curly slide. Am I too old to go here? Adorable, right? I walked in on someone in the bathroom. What? I just walked in on someone in the bathroom. - Who? The - I don't know. I don't know. The guy we're meeting with? I don't know. I don't know. I am telling you, There are no strawberries in here. Well, I saw them in there. Well, maybe they ran away, 'cause the pizza was like, "Hey, get out of here, You stupid strawberries." I think when andy finally asks me out He's gonna try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with. The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing. First let me say I told them everything That you wanted me to say, In just the way you wanted me to say it, so Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. Okay, um, I told the story of your uncle, And I have a feeling that you would have really, uh, Really been proud of the way Okay, um Wait a minute. Who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? I want to see who it is. Turn me around. I don't It's just Turn me around. Now. Hey, buddy. Is it something I said? Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello. Oh, hello, mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with sabre. I think you have a great accent. Aw, thank you. I've been working on it Since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure Of this video chat? Well, I'm a little concerned About all of these changes, To be quite frank. I think we have done things A certain way here At dunder mifflin for quite some time, and Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, But the last time I saw a company As mismanaged as dunder mifflin Was my grandson's snowball company, So you'll excuse me If I prefer that you all adapt To the way we do things. Okay. I feel very strongly That you can't just come in here And change everything That people have been doing forever. Is christian slater back there? BecauseHe knows. He'd know what to do. So listen. Why don't you tell gabe If by the end of the day You can't handle the changes. I have already told him, But I will tell him again if you think that'll help. I would take until the end of the day If I were you. Pam and Jim? Hey. I'm jerry. Hi, Jerry. - Jerry. - Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room. This is great. Got to confess, We came a little early, So we got a quick look around, but Oh, so you saw it already? No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular. It's lovely. Got to take this. Sorry. - Do it. - Okay. Hi, this is jerry. Okay, you've got to pull it together. We should just go. He's really uncomfortable. He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird. What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open? That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem. Sorry about that. Right this way. All right. I have come here today To talk to Mr. David wallace About this whole thing going on with sabre. He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by unannounced. But then again who is? - Hey. Hi. Sorry. - Michael. I hope you're not busy doing something. No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on. - You sure? - You look great. You look great too. You hungry? I'm just having lunch. Oh, yeah, that sounds good. Fantastic, Teddy. Look who just stopped in. Keep it up, son. Really loud. Oh, yummy. You have got the life, my friend. Yeah. Can I just stay here and never go back? Things not going so well there? Oh, man. How much time do you have? I have a doctor's appointment Next Thursday. Yeah. Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool? Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out. Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, So I didn't know if you did anything. No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael. Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, And thought I'd come by, see No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to? I don't know. Uh, but maybe, uh Actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. Maybe we'll go outside. Outside. There was one thing we were curious about, Uh, your flexibility on things like easter or memorial day, Because we might want To change our days around a little bit. That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, And you're already lining up your holiday plans. Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, So you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes. Yeah. If the time comes, we can discuss it. Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? What? Seriously? You told her? Did it? I it might have come up While we were waiting for you. And you you thought that might have something to do - With how the meeting is going? - No, I didn't Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well. Well, you didn't consider the fact That it might not be going super well Just because it might not be going super well? Nope. 'cause we're really nice people, But you don't seem to like us. I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be As charming as you think you are? Oh, this coming from the guy Who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man? It doesn't lock for the children's safety. Anybody could have walked in. It was story time. Sabre is changing everything. Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David wallace would know what to do. What should I do, david wallace? I don't know. I mean, what can you do? Mm. Exactly. What are you thinking? I that's a tough one. It is a tough one. I don't have any ideas for you there. Yeah. But one would be good. Hey, oh, okay. Wait. Okay. I want to tell you about a business idea I have. - Okay. - 'kay? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay? So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves. Uh, hacky sacks. Drumsticks. Picks it up. So the kid's making the noise To pick it up? No. No, no, no. That's the that's the vacuum noise. Oh, okay. You you don't like it. No, I think it's No, no, it's okay. Another guy from dunder mifflin, Arnie from research, He's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh It's like a shop-vac. Did I say that? Yep. It'll be okay. Hey, any fun weekend plans? No. You? Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies or parties, Or anything you might want to invite someone to? Nothing. It's wide open. Okay. That's as hard as I can hint. Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I could get arnie on board If you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again. The what? Suck it. That's what it's called. Oh, okay. Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it. Like it. There are very few things that would make me Not want to team up with david wallace. D suck it is one of 'em. See you later. Oh, Michael! Bye now. Thank you for coming. Thanks for having me. Well, that's not the david wallace That I remember. That is some sort of weird creature That lives in david wallace's house. Oh, my God! All right. Just get me out of here. Hello. Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now, if everyone would please ready their canteens, So I can fill them With the sweet, sweet nectar of gabe's homeland, And then propose a toast. Here we go. You know when people say getting fired Was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Well, I'm not really one for making speeches. Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot. But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. That's your toast? No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with sabre is gonna work out. I have a very good feeling about it. Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud. Here's my toast. Orange juice Is in here. And, like sabre, It is from florida, And it is good. Just 'cause you have liquid, That doesn't make it a toast. Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container To us and to sabre. To us and to sabre. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah. Really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.

She bought us sight unseen, like a mail order bride. [chuckling] so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak english? [woman chuckling] Ha ha. Why, hello! - This is michael scott, co-regional manager Of this branch. Pleasure to meet you, miss bennett. Uh, that's mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the mrs. Just to piss off the new wife. Oh All: [chuckling] Well, let's take a gander around this place. These sure are pretty dogs. - They love a good crotch. - Yeah, they sure do. You should take that as a compliment. Oh, I do. - Hello? - Hello. Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room? I am treating you the same as a man For whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the president. Or judge judy. I like that. - Um, this is accounting. - Uh-huh. Hi. - Good -looking group. Over here is meredith palmer, creed bratton. Another couple of heartbreakers. Who's this tall drink of sun tea? That is jim halpert. He is the co-regional manager of this office. I thought this guy was the manager. Oh, he is. He's the comanager. That's the other comanager. Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that. [chuckles] Got some valentines cards for my coworkers And my bro-workers. No. No-- What--no candy? Valentine's day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a valentine's day card. But I didn't want to seem too eager, So I got cards for everyone in the whole office To kind of dilute it a little bit. Look alive. Ow! Jeez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat! Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting Or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat. Jo, I don't know how things work in florida-- Which, from your description, sounds like A colorful, lawless swamp. But here It takes two men to do one job, Where in florida it might take one very strong woman To do such a job. - WhoaWhoa! - Whoa, whoa! - I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here-- Michael handles more of the big picture stuff, And I handle more of the day-to-day stuff. - Yeah - So together - I think I understand. - All right. Each of you is doing half a job. - No. - And sometimes I can Hardly handle that. Now, this is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna abide it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, 'cause gravy ain't sweet Is it, jim? [whispers] I don't think so. - Michael? - Forget the question. I think one of you should return to sales And the other one will be manager. I humbly accept the management position. Why would you just automatically get it? BecauseWell, jim, Where I'm from, there're two types of folk-- Those who ain't, And those who are kne e-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Y'all come back now. Do you even know what that means? Yes. Well, I'm gonna let this marinate, so you can go. - Um - You can go on. Yep. Shoo. I'm joleen bennett. Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor. Close, personal friends with nancy pelosi, And truman capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, And now I have my own pilot's license. I am ceo of sabre international, And I sell the best damn printers And all-in-one machines korea can make. Pleased to meet you. Whoa, traffic jam. - Uh-oh! Traffic jam on route 3. - Beep beep! - Beep beep! There's blood everywhere! [both giggling] Um, I got you a valentine's card. - You did? - Yep. Oh, a bird and a dog. Yeah, well, it's snoopy and woodstock. - You named them? - Uh, charles schulz did. I thought it was relevant 'cause I got you all those birds for christmas. Remember? - Uh, yeah, I do remember. Aw, they love each other. Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed. Oh, it smells really good too. Yeah. It's roger federer for men. I sprayed some in there. Andy, whoa! Thank you very much. It's got pheromones in it. - Hey. - Hi. UhJust choosin' seats. Not getting married. Chop-chop, little onion. Jo, there's books in my chair. That's right, darling. Now you're the proud new owner of a sabre handbook And my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces. I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns dunder mifflin, right? I mean, sabre? What's that? Some company we never heard of From down in tallahassee? Where is that? Near mars? No, we know. Texas. Now, dunder mifflin has an arm's reach Into all these small businesses all over the northeast. And now we're gonna take that arm And we're gonna start selling Printers. I could manage my way around that. They're the easiest to use printers in the market. I will try to manage my excitement. I have been saying the word "manager" a lot So whenever jo thinks manager, she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with joe camel By making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now Without thinking of a penis. And vice versa. I think that's it. So we're all good. Thanks, y'all. - I, um Oh, my god. I guess andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But I guess in most romantic comedies, The guy you're supposed to be with Is the one that you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying Or possibly homosexual. So check this out. According to the handbook, You could make more money as a salesman Than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year. i>- This is way more than I make now. I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know, some people say they're not in it for the money. Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And, quite honestly, the women. [click] hey. Got a second? - Sure. - All right. What, are you here to tell me That you think I would be a better manager And that you are sorry for being such a jerk? ActuallyYeah. What? Exactly that. I think that you Absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do. [laughs] what? Really? - Yeah. [laughing] wow! Wow!  la la la la, hello, oscar  Michael. Reading. - What are you reading? - The atlantic. Oh, that is my favorite ocean--I love it! I'm so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim's stepping down to salesman. I am going to be the sole manager once again. I should step into sales myself. Why? Is there an untapped gay market? Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales. Where did you get that information? Manual. Manuel who? Mm-hmm. Well, according to the manual, There is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled. [quietly] son of a bitch. Pardon me. - Oh. Speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat. - Okay. - Now, jim here is, uh Thinking about taking himself out of the running For being manager. - Yep. - Really? Oh, that is so sweet of you! But I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, And I think I want to go back to sales. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Really? - Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, But you can't take the sales out of salesman. Well, I think you're both being a little too modest. No, I really, really think michael Is better at being manager for so many reasons. - Mm -mm. No. I think I would be bad. IWould sleep in my office, And I would sexually harass people. Why would you do that? I'm turning myself in right now. You know, michael, You have more experience in sales and management, So I'm gonna defer to your judgment. Thank you. I think you will become the salesman, And congratulations You're gonna be the new manager of this branch! Great! That's great. Congratulations. [quietly] have fun signing my commission checks, boss. Oh! Michael marked his heights. He'sGrown. Mm. [both chuckle] Bobcat, this is dragon. Listen, he's been promoted to sole manager. We have got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in 90 seconds. You're 20 minutes late. Um I was at another dumpster. Just admit you lost track of time. Ryan and I have been meeting up To work on our diabolical plot against jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair. i>- Did you see saw? Course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time. No. Uh, the movie. Did you see the movie saw? Oh. Yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw. Okay, the reason these movies are so popular Is the element of psychological torment. I like where you're going with this. Continue. Can we lure him into an old warehouse or something? I have an old barn. It's kinda smelly - Yes! But that might be a plus. Okay, then what? i>- We do what they did in saw. I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. - I don't-- - I have a mask Okay. That's your idea? Exactly like in the movie? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life! Well, suggest something else then, don't just-- He's supposed to cut his leg off? - Don't just criticize my idea! - Think! You think of something then! Michael, I'm worried that, uh, Not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk. How is that possible? Well, in your old office, There were all those ledges and extra space-- No excuses, erin. Come on! Make it happen. You know, I actually think that I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager. Oh. Yeah. Fine, fine. - Okay. - Leave it here. All right. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [telephone rings] [ringing] Michael scott, head of sales. You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there. The new I.T. Guy. Nick. - Nick. - I think he's the key. He's very trusting. He's looking for friends. He's been given an awesome amount of power And does not know how to wield it. Like frodo. Why don't you just let me handle the tolkien references, Okay, dumb jock? Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like gollum. Smeagol was corrupted And became gollum. I might start a diabolical plot against him After this one. Who's hungry? - What is that? - That's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 And say, "who's hungry?" - [laughs] oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though. Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy? - Why would I want to do that? - It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, And aSpinning brain is a working brain. For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here. - Oh, sure. - Yeah. Thank you. Well It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks. Bye-bye. [train whistle sound] I just got a new account. The gentleman's club in carbondale. It is called curves. I went by there the other day. Saw some of the women walking in. NotReally my cup of tea. Actually, kevin, you might like it. Nice. You know, we really don't announce out loud Our sales that much. Why not? It's part of the sales experience. It's not really 1992 anymore. Well, okay. [laughter] "you brighten my day with the sound of your voice. "you bring so much laughter and love. "you're everything to me, And I was so blessed when god sent you here to me." - Jeez louise. - I know. Obsessed with me much? - Well, everyone got one. - What did yours say? "friends are worth sharing a doghouse with." It's no wonder That andy gave kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing and dance And gets all of her clothes at the mall And I feel like such a fool For thinking that andy was only going after one girl. 'cause andy bernard is a playboy, And why shouldn't he be? He's got it all. Ho ho. There he is, the I.T. Guy. See you discovered the break room. - Uh, yep. - I imagine One of the best things about being an I.T. Guy Is you get to know everyone's computer passwords. You know, I actually don't. [all laugh] Listen. I know you have to say that, But we got a little problem here. There is a employee named jim halpert, And he's doi some terrible things, okay? He's molesting people via the internet, And we need to stop him. I think that you should call the cops-- No. The cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password To jim halpert's computer. I don't know what to tell you, man, I'm sorry. I just can't give out his password like that. Nick, we could make things very Very difficult for you. Are you You threatening me? Threatening you? No. What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here? MichaelStop. No, I'm serious. We don't have to put up-- Is it the dogs? - [whispers] michael. You know what? We don't have to deal with this. I'm going to google sulfur maps. Michael, it's phyllis. No, this is geological. I sent an email out to everyone in this area That this might be a side effect To my new allergy medication I'm on. - Are you kidding me? - No. And you guys are okay with this? She sent an email It's not 'cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed. Oh, my god. Oh[giggling] you scared me. I'm sorry. I thought you saw me. I didn't see you. And you were there all along. Well, I warmed it up for you. So should be good to go. Cool. Thanks. Bye, andy. - That was weird. - No, it ain't. We all saw the valentine you gave her. I don't even know what that card said. Believe me, if I got that card, We'd be in the bathroom doing it rightNow. Oh! Hey. Hey. You know, it's funny, I used to stand in here And wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here. Well, the grass is always greener. Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch. Well, it's what you wanted. I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here. For the record, I fought this, all right? And nowI'm not really sure what we do. We make a poster that says "happy opposite day," And she sees it on the way out-- That's stupid. Oh, I wish we had one of those Amnesia flashlights from men in black and just-- Hey, what was that movie Where their boss was within earshot, And they could have just gone and talked to her? - Lethal weapon? - That's it. I think we should do it the lethal weapon way. You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, Fire you and get two people in here Who don't need so much management? Wha? What I'm saying-- Michael's saying that he's better at being a manager, And I agree, because he's a better people person, Weird--weirdly. - And weirdly, I'm a good dog person, right, guys? See? They love me. Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job. JustStop meetin' with me to talk about it. All right. All right. [cell phone rings] - oh. I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em. 'scuse me, everyone. Please check your emails. I just sent you the following message: "coworkers, you may have received a valentine from me. "please understand this does not mean That I like you in any way." You don't even like us as friends? Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like like you. What are we, five? "please don't read into this card. Yours, in professionalism, nard dog." Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you That said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, andy? It's-- That wasn't-- I like someone else. Who? [snorts] It'sNot Whether or not [mumbles] Who? What? Yeah, I guess andy never liked kelly. How about that? [inhales] Oh, it smells good in here. It sure does. Okay, we have your Space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, Your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator. ErinWhat about my keyboard? [soft electronic music] Ah. So good to be home.   How 'bout a little bossa nova? Oh [bossa nova plays]   He looks happy. Yep. Well, well, well. Hmm. Boss forWhat was it? Oh4 1/2 hours? New record Low. Previous record, henry rostin. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left Because he had family matters to attend to, And he--what-- Michael? I can't help but think That something we did made this possible.
I just wanted to check and see if there was anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave. (CHUCKLING) Yeah. I'm pregnant. Great. Well, I'll write up the order. Wait a minute. Okay, thanks. You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales. Hey, did I tell you we're gonna have a baby? (CHUCKLES) Thank you very much. I'm excited Oh. Definitely. No. No! You need to come by your sales honorably. There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it. Hey, there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he's never seen it beard so quickly. Okay. I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd. Kevin, you're such a gourmand. I cooked my way through Julia Child's cookbook, and now I'm halfway through The Twilight Cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's cornflake chicken. Hmm. KEVIN: Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch and first dinner. I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast. Mmm. That sounds great. What are you thinking? I think it should be a surprise. (GROANS) Getting there, huh? No, no. I still have time. I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor. Yeah. We're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO. PAM: If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors. JIM: Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice, because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is gonna have to take care of it, and I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy. I cannot wait for that joke to be over. Oh. (EXCLAIMING) MICHAEL: Contraptions! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think that I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed Class C driver in the state of Pennsylvania. Michael. I gassed up the car. Actually, I put diesel in this time. Tried to save some money. Michael, you shouldn't have done that. Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office. You know the baby's not gonna live here, right? Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too. Mmm. That logic's airtight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning Man, Porta Potty. (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) Yuck! TMI. How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital! Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight. Ooh! Spooky. But why? Because the insurance company only covers two nights. Everything's fine. We have plenty of time. Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's gonna become a teenager in there, and you'll be up all night from the rock music. Shut up, Nick. God! What a weird thing to say. Weird IT nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd. (CHUCKLES) What are you looking at? Nerd. KELLY: Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself. Bear my child. Excuse me? I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything. Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 p.m. In our old meeting spot and bang it out. (EXHALES) That's seven minutes. Here we go. Hold on. Hold on. This is happening. It isn't midnight yet. Are you serious? Pam. No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes. I'm gonna be okay. We should really try to make it to midnight. Pam, please. Yeah, no, you really should, 'cause if your baby's born tomorrow, he's gonna have the same birthday as Buttmud Brooks, my old roommate. Did you hear that? Buttmud Brooks. Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart. Five minutes apart. So the plan was seven minutes, but we're calling an audible, because that's her call, 'cause she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. Stop watching me. Okay, Crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you. Like sell printers. Mmm-hmm. Well, now until Friday, 20% off all toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and just do a quick check? (CLICKS TONGUE) Not till midnight. Guys, a word of advice, speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Junior after my father, until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds. I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Junior. My brother was born and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Junior name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby-name book. You know what? It's getting really crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work 'cause the day's not out yet. No, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore. ANDY: Yes! I feel like this noise is gonna prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals. Actually, the distractions are good. I don't think I'm gonna make it till midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it. Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes. No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now, conference room. Topic, potpourri. Let's go! MICHAEL: Um, I'm sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, "What were the first 13 colonies?" Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. (IMITATES FARTING) The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body. Can we do sleight-of-hand tricks? I will allow that. Yes! Can anyone do those? I'm gonna go look at the Internet. (PAM GROANS) (JIM EXCLAIMS) All right. That's a good one. PAM: (GROANS) Okay. Sorry, guys. Just keep talking. Okay. Oh, God, Pam. You are a woman warrior. Oh. Thanks, Kelly. Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies? Uh, special skills? Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request. Yeah, Phyl. Yeah. I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club. No, no. I don't think anybody wants to see that. I can do the Evolution of Dance dance. That sounds good. Do you need some music or No, actually, music would just throw me off. Okay. I need complete silence, okay? You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm gonna have to start over. The Evolution of Dance dance. "You let me in your bed But now I sleep alone "Trapped with the forgotten In my detritus home" Affirmed, Seattle Slew, Secretariat, Citation, Assault, Count Fleet, Whirlaway, War Admiral, Omaha, Gallant Fox. And I know this. Uh, the jockey was Johnny Loftus, sired by Star Shoot. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) Good afternoon. Have a seat. What is this? Before we conceive a child, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract. Of course. It's been a long time since we've come down here separately. You know, I was thinking Now then, let's get to it, shall we? Ltem one. Child will be breastfed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich, winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed? Agreed. (GROANING) Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another 75 contractions and you are going to be there. For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go give Dr. Rezvani a quick call. He'll probably know Jim, please, happy thoughts here. Happy times. Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times. All right. Jim, as a matter of fact, I've printed out and I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one. "Stimulate the nipples." Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle. Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt. I have a shirt like that in my car. Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it? Okay, uh, the second one is "walk around." We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods. Okay, the opposite of that. Stick spicy food up her butt. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Come on. Let's go to the hospital. PAM: Jim. Jim. Pam, let's go to the hospital now. Sweetie, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions. Mmm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry. Why don't you go do some work? Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled, and you know how very rarely I use that word. I know. JIM: "Frazzled." You don't like to be frazzled. No, I don't. PAM: Okay. Oh. And by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally. (EXCLAIMS) Someone's freaking. Getting a little frazzled. (ALL LAUGHING) Yeah, he is. JIM: I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy. She's crazy. I'm not crazy. She's crazy. "Five to seven minutes." "Five to seven minutes." "Six minutes." Different, but not really. "Five to seven minutes." (SIGHS) Acceptable names include, and are limited to, Ebenezer. Jebediah. Honus. Jedediah. Worf. No Star Trek names. Okay. Fine. What if it's a girl? Irrelevant question. Section 5A. "Child shall be male." Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here. Yes, you can. No. It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months. Absolutely not. Hey. Hey. Oh. I'm not gonna get in the car, 'cause I know if I do, you'll try to drive me to the hospital. Ah! You know me too well. (CHUCKLES) Okay, Jim. Yeah. Everything is fine. Totally. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay? Did you say "she"? I called the doctor, like, a week ago. I couldn't wait. Oh, God, don't be mad. Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl. Mmm-hmm. Wow. We're having a little girl. (LAUGHS) (EXCLAIMS) Man! I know. Whoo! All right. Well, I definitely feel better. Good. Yeah. All right. Okay. Hey, did you change? Oh, yeah. My water broke. Oh. (PAM CHUCKLES) Oh. Oh! Whoa! Pam? Pam! Okay. All right. Okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please. Is it midnight yet? No, it's 4:35. made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex, like, seven-and-a-half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we? No. Not yet, Michael. MICHAEL: We can do it. Oh, wow! It's almost time for ultra feast. Where's Kevin? What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital? That's Fancy Feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony. What is October Feast? There is no rush to get to the hospital. I'm fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there. Our ultra feast menu's theme, Hollywood. We have ratatouille from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I Are you okay? Mmm. Yes. I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah, the doctor said that it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it. (GROANING) Okay. Okay. Jim? I think this feast is over JIM: All right. and it's time to go to the hospital. Time to go. No. That's right. Let's do this. Let's give it a shot. No, it's better. JIM: Here we go. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine. JIM: Hey, come on. They're not that bad still. Let's go to the hospital. Pam. No, it's passing, it's fine. Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital. Let's go, Pam. It's okay. Michael says we should go now. Yeah, I think we should head out. PAM: It's fine. Pam. You know what? It passed. It's good. Absolutely fine. Come on. Let's go. We gotta go. Babe, I'm not going. We need to go. It's fine. Hey, come on. We really gotta go. No. I'm not going! I am not going, okay? All right. I'm not going today because I can't do it! I don't think I can do it! Hey. Hey. Hey. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding? If anyone can do this, you can do this. You can do this. You can do this. Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared. I'm scared, too. I'm petrified. But the best news is, we're gonna have a baby today. Yeah. A really awesome baby. We're gonna have a baby. So let's have it at the hospital. Let's do that. How are we doing on contractions? Two minutes apart. Two minutes. Oh, God. Oh, no. I thought I told you MICHAEL: It's okay. No, I told you to warn me at five minutes. PAM: Jim, we waited too long. I know. We waited too long. Two minutes doesn't do us any good. What happened to four and three? MICHAEL: We're okay, Jim. Okay, Pamela, you know what time it is? I don't want to have my baby here. You know You're not going to. You know where you're going? The hospital. Yes you are, and you know what you're gonna have? A baby. Yes. We're going to the hospital and we're gonna have a baby. I got it! I got it! Everybody, it's go time! Action station! Stanley, man the phones! Meredith, please grab a bottle of water. Erin, call an ambulance, please! DWIGHT: No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call the ambulance, I call the cops. All right, we're driving ourselves, actually. MICHAEL: No, Jim. You are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check. Got it. All right, I have my wallet. MICHAEL: Yes. Go bag's in the car. Go bag? Where's my go bag? JIM: Keys. I need my keys! Where's my go bag? There's nothing in it. You are telling me now that there is nothing in it! Okay, great. Should I bring a dictionary to the hospital? The hospital will provide dictionaries. Bring the thesaurus. Did anyone check how dilated she is? This is ridiculous. Dwight, get away. No, no, no, Dwight, let Jim do that, please. Okay? I didn't know we had a tape measure. "We" don't. Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found them. They're here. Here we go. Here we go. MICHAEL: Here we go! PHYLLIS: Good luck! ANDY: Good luck, Pam. KEVIN: Bye, Pam. Thank you!

Can I No, no, no, no! Out, out, out! Idiot! Dwight, what is the traffic like? Doesn't matter. I'll escort you! MICHAEL: All right. (TIRES SCREECHING) (MICHAEL EXCLAIMS) Let's go! MICHAEL: Easy, Dwight. Michael! What? Michael! What? This is where I saw that deer last week. Where? Right over by that fence. By the bushes? Okay, Michael, focus! Okay, go, go, go! Guys, come on! DWIGHT: Let's go! DWIGHT: I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. Got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends. All right, here we go. You're doing great. Okay, just breathe. (PAM GROANING) She'll be here soon. She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised. Michael! Yeah? Stop texting. Put your phone away! Michael, come on! I'm texting about you, okay? PAM: Come on! (DWIGHT GROANS) All right. Let's move! (CAR HORN HONKING) (POLICE SIREN SOUNDING) What? POLICE OFFICER: Pull over. You're kidding me! Pull over. You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer. Don't make this difficult, Dwight. Wait! Wait, my iPod's not in here. Okay. It has the birth song on it. Okay, I know, but my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine. Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack. Okay, so what do you want to do? I don't know. Let's go by the house and get it. It's only 20 minutes past the hospital. Pam, no. Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now. Guys, guys, stop fighting. Come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? (CHUCKLES) Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. Ready? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Dwight Schrute. Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday. Then why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM-ing you how bored I was. Okay. Dwight! Go to my house, get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under I don't need a key. Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen, it's under the No, don't. Don't. Don't tell me. (JABBERING) Dwight, just listen. It's underneath Okay. You all right? Yeah. Do you have everything, guys? Michael, just go park the car. Okay. All right. Sir! Dunder Mifflin. It's okay. You can't park here. (MICHAEL GRUNTS) I just did. Pam's doing great. Uh, she's 10 inches dilated now. Sorry, meters Centimeters. And she's also fully effaced, which I don't know what that is. But no baby yet. It's only been six Nineteen hours. And I was sent out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very Daddy? She's ready to push. Okay! Where's my little niblet? Halpert, room D1. All right. Family only beyond this point. Thank you. Here we go. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (PAM SCREAMING) JIM: Doing great. Push again! DOCTOR: Not yet. JIM: No, don't push. Pull! Pull! JOSIE: Why don't you get some more ice chips? PAM: No, Jim, stay! JIM: Okay. Really push this time, Pam. PAM: Okay. (PAM SCREAMING) (EXCLAIMS) Nope. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Gotta go wash my eyes. That kid's gonna have a lot of hair. Have you guys seen her? She hasn't popped yet. What? Damn it! She was supposed to come out yesterday. I decided to give Baby Halpert the newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back 55 bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper. This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here. I think it's gonna be any minute now. But you don't know that. We could be here another half an hour. Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do? I have an ice cream cake in the car. Oh, my God! Go! Go! Go! Are you insane? All right. Guys? Hello? DOCTOR: You're doing great. Just relax. Um Sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna (PAM SCREAMING) You're kind of losing them. PAM: God! JIM: Oh, my God. Look at her. The baby, she's so beautiful. Oh, my God. PAM: Oh, my God. (BABY CRYING) (MOCKINGLY) Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see? ORDERLY: Sir. Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Okay. Put it out. All right. Can't smoke anywhere these days. She's incredible. You want to count her fingers and toes again? No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there are still 12 of each. Okay. MICHAEL: Guys, guys! Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert. Eleven pounds, four She's seven pounds, two ounces, 18 inches. Seven pounds. Mother and daughter are doing great. (ALL CHEERING) Congratulations. That's great. (EXCLAIMS) HELENE: There. Hey, Grandma's back. Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee. Great. Thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months. HELENE: May I? PAM: Yes. (CECELIA COOING) Somebody has a full diaper. Oh. Let me get it. JIM: I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you. (MEOWING) MICHAEL: (MOCKINGLY) Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh. Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness. What are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma. Hello, Michael. Hello. Oh. How are you? I worry about you. You know, I think it's time for me to go. Oh. Okay. Love you. Love you as a friend. Love you, Mom. (GASPS) MICHAEL: Oh! (MOCKINGLY) I want to hold the baby. Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first. Oh, right. PAM: Again. No pants. Oh. Okay. Ready? Mmm-hmm. Oh, wow. (CHUCKLES) Michael. Michael. That's so weird. She was saying it just before you got here. DWIGHT: Yesterday I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. I read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets. Time to get to work. There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insurmountainable. I made a family. I got these two together and I made a family. This man has a gift. Who else here is single? I'm not single. I have a man. I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too. Why don't you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs? Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? Who else? Come on. People, I know models. (CHUCKLES) Plus-size models, maybe. (LAUGHS) You got that right. Meredith? Come on. You're obviously single. You know it. I am never getting married. Like Clooney. Andrew? What about you? Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so (EXCLAIMS) Not good timing. Yes, I'm gonna ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible. Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love. (IMITATES GUN FIRING) (EXCLAIMS) (SCREAMS) (IMITATES EXPLOSION) (COOING) Remember yesterday, when we were terrified of being parents? We were just kids. What did we know? Hey, how we doing? Good. Great. Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night? Doesn't she sleep here? She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot. I think we'll be okay. Okay, great. (YAWNING) (PAM EXCLAIMS) Big yawn. (CRYING) Ready, one, two, three. PAM: One, and then wrap around. It's okay. I don't understand. Hold that arm down. I can't. She's too strong. Careful, though. You don't want to break it. She's not going to Just I got it. All right. PAM: Go. Go. I'm done. Nurse? How you doing? I don't know. I just I can't tell if she's getting anything. Really? It doesn't feel right. Well, you're pushing the milk out, right? How would one do that? Well, isn't it kind of like Like that? Do you want to try it, Jim? Mmm-mmm. I think you're good. Doing a good job. (CECELIA CRYING) Somebody buzzed? Oh, really? Must have sat on it, Pam. I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right. Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later. Even if she's not getting anything? Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle once we're in the nursery. No. I read in the book about nipple confusion. Oh, good. You know everything. I mean, she's just really tentative about latching, and I just want to keep her self-esteem up. I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay? All right. All right. It's gonna be all right. Yeah, maybe it'll be good 'cause then she can, like, socialize with the other babies. (LAUGHING) No, yeah, that would be good. You wanted to see me? What would you say if I told you that I was about to change your life? Oh, boy! (KEVIN MUMBLING) What's that sound? Ta-da! I would like you to meet your new boyfriend. Yes. I don't know what to say. Say nothing. You will learn to love me. Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You got to let the cookies cool before you pop them in your mouth. Okay. Why don't you guys get to know each other, maybe have lunch together? Erin, would you have lunch with me? Okay. MICHAEL: Good. Yes! Michael, can I talk to you privately? Sure. Kevin, please leave. Bye. MICHAEL: Bye. I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression that I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy. (SIGHS) Okay. This is going to kill Kevin. I'm sure he'll be fine. I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was 17. Had some problems (JABBERING) Really? No. Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart, but he is very sensitive, and it won't kill Erin to just go and have lunch with him in the break room, like I promised him. I bet his heart is enlarged, though. I don't want anyone to die. Just don't let him sit on you. (LAUGHING) I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him. (CHUCKLES) Hi. Hi. Nice. She touched my shoulder. Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy. Oh. Hi. Hi. Sorry. Hi. So sorry. Careful. (SOFTLY) Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there. I know. Did you see that? I'm pretty sure she's Hey. (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING) Did you grow up around here? No. So, you must have grown up around somewhere else? Yes. Why was I hiding behind the plant? Well, in college I took a botany class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh Kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botany class. And then they would say things like, "Oh, this guy's gonna fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out at them and confront them and be like, "You think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted." Oh. The reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and I was jealous. Uh, hi. Pam Halpert? Yes. Hi, I'm Clarke. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant. JIM: Yep. Um, yeah, that would be great. Really great. When's she available? Actually, I'm the consultant. (CHUCKLES) Got milk? (CHUCKLING) All right, let's see what we're working with. (CLEARS THROAT) So, the biggest thing besides not being able to get her to latch I'll get that for you. Oh, thank you. is that I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything. Let me feel here. Okay. CLARKE: Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand? PAM: Okay. When you're feeding you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Does that hurt? No, it feels pressure. Okay. You sure it doesn't hurt? No. It just feels like pressure. CLARKE: Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? PAM: Mmm-hmm. Like that? It's stimulated. Mmm-hmm. Yep. Yep. PAM: Mmm-hmm. CLARKE: So you just want to do that and that will Perfect. CLARKE: The baby should grab onto that. I think she will. I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if We'll figure it out, probably. CLARKE: It doesn't Why don't you bring your baby over here? Okay. She's beautiful. Yes. Oh, thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay? Okay. Please do. Oh, shoot. Shoot, she fell off. Oh. Uh Try the torpedo thing. Will you just grab Clarke real quick? No need. I saw him do it. I can try it. Jim, please, please, please. I think it would be weird if you did it. That makes sense. I'll just go get the other guy. DWIGHT ON PHONE: Hey, what's up, kid? Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I prepared for you? Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon? I look forward to it. Very well. Goodbye. (BABY CRYING) Jim. Jim, get her. Hmm? Get the baby. Get her, come on. JIM: Okay. (SHUSHING) I know, I know. Okay. Come here. All right. I got her. (SIGHING) Okay. Okay. Okay. Jim. She latched. She latched! That's amazing. Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the C thing. That's awesome. Oh! We're doing it. That's great. We're really parents now. Kevin, Erin would like a few words with you. Hey. Hi. I've really enjoyed our time together. Yeah. Me, too. I want to continue working on our friendship It was really, really fun. 'cause I think our friendship could be a really cool thing. Yeah. Me, too. And you're my friend. Yeah. I hope that I'm your friend. Yeah. And Oh, my God. This is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin? You said she liked me. Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place. I've done better than Erin. No, you haven't. Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael. Lynn was as hot as Erin. Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan and they were so much hotter than you. This isn't about me, and that is debatable, and I have a personality, whereas you Yes, Andy? (THUD) (GROANS) Kev. Nice going. Knock-knock. Oh, hey, Isabel. Oh, hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her? Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here. Let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. ISABEL: Look at you. Come here, sweetie. (GASPS) Oh, my God. JIM: What? Wrong baby. What? Wrong baby. This is not our baby! Oh, my God. (SHUSHING) (CECELIA COOING) Oh. (CRYING) Has she been fussing long? No. Not at all. Perfect. I was out like a light. Hey! She's not hungry. (BABY CONTINUES CRYING) How's it going? Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she just won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby (LAUGHING) Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So, you excited to take your baby home? We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00? Yeah. You can. It's 2:35. Half hour. Well, 25 minutes. (CHUCKLING) And you're all set with the car seat? Yes. Car seat's right there. That bottom part needs to go in the car. Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car. (CHUCKLES) Be back in 25 minutes. Or it can be a half hour, if you need it to be. Can we get a late checkout? I don't think she heard me. Hello? Dwight? What What are you doing here? Isabel, hello. Yeah, the kitchen was disgusting, so Wow. New cabinets. Yeah. All I did was bring macaroni and cheese. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Where's the fridge? Oh, it's in the backyard. I'll take this. (INHALES DEEPLY) Well, I'll let you get back to it. Hey, listen, I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning? You know, just for fun. Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too. Are they, now? (CHUCKLES) How some people spend their money, right? Yeah. All right. I'll call you, kid. Do that. You really sure we should be leaving? Yeah. (CRYING) But you hear the baby crying, right? Mmm-hmm. Where's your car? It's in the lot. A lot of fathers bring the car around. Right. Okay. Yes. That would be a smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back. Okay, please hurry. Erin, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm gonna stand here and wait for the confirmation. Okay. Good. The fax says, "Erin, will you have dinner with me? From, Andy." And the number is our office fax number. (FAX MACHINE BEEPING) It's busy. Why don't I keep trying and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit? (MUMBLES) Sorry. That's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately or you're fired. You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. (SOBBING) I've been having a tough day. Oh, God, no. Um Just read the fax. You read the fax. I'm asking you out. (CHUCKLES) Oh, my God. That's amazing! Let me just fax this and I'll check my planner. So, it's a date? Yes! Do you have a day in mind? ANDY: Yeah, what day? What day? ERIN: Every day is fine. ANDY: What's that one? ERIN: Thursday? Okay. Let's do it. ERIN: (CHUCKLES) We Okay! Would you like me to help you up out of the chair? Oh, yeah. Sorry. We've just got a lot of discharges today. Okay. Okay. Thanks. All right, thanks. All right. (CECELIA CRYING) Hey. You want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay. Okay. Come here. Just you and me. Just you and me. Come on. (CRYING STOPS) There we go. Yeah. Oh, yeah! Like that. Oh. There we go. You got it. Five tickets on the windshield. Hey. Hi. We did it. You used my move, didn't you? I used a variation of your move. (LAUGHS) MICHAEL: There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles and find true love. And that's what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today. I think I'm going to be sick. Two forms of ID, please. (CLEARS THROAT) And now you. Two forms of ID, please. All right, all is in order. I just need your signature. What is it? Nothing. All right. How would you like to celebrate? Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick. What? I couldn't find your iPod. Give me a couple days. Be out of your hair. I'm checking if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave. I'm pregnant. Great. - I'll write up the order. - Wait. - Thanks. - You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales. Did I tell you we're going to have a baby? Thank you very much. I'm excite Definitely. You need to come by your sales honorably. There is nothing dishonorable about talking about you. People like it. Hey, there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, would you be interested in restocking on paper? I could sure use the money. My cousin came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. It's just horrific. The doctor says he's never seen it beard so quickly. I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd. Collioure Jarick Arrow Titou Sk0r Yomoy BrJk The Ni.Knight Épisode 6x16-17 The Delivery Kevin, you're such a gourmand. I cooked my way through Julia Child's cookbook, and now I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's cornflake chicken. Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot Not all meals, just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner. I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner, one last ultra-feast. That's great. What are you thinking? I think it should be a surprise. Getting here? I still have time. I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor. We're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO. After midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate, surrounded by doctors. Not to mention the extra night's sleep will be very nice, because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is gonna have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy. I cannot wait for that joke to be over. "Contraptions!". She's "contrapting". You know what? I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed class "C" driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gas up the car. I put diesel in this time Try to save some money. - You shouldn't do it. - Happy. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office. You know the baby's not gonna live here? The baby was conceived here, so it might as well live here a bit too. That logic's airtight, unfortunately, it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-a-potty. How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Hospital! We're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight. Spooky. But why? Because the insurance company only covers two nights. Everything's fine. We have plen of time. You don't want to wait too long. The baby'll become a teenager, and you'll be up all night - from the rock music. - Shut up, Nick. God! What a weird thing to say, weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd. What are you looking at? Nerd. Did you know that labor can last weeks? They take your insides out, and they just plop 'em on a table. And sometimes epidurals don't work. And you can poop yourself. Bear my child. Excuse me? I want a child for business reasons, and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything. Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 p.m. at our old meeting spot and bang it out. That's seven minutes. Here we go. - This is happening. - It isn't midnight yet. Are you serious? The doctor said every five to seven minutes. I'm gonna be okay. We should try to make it to midnight. Please. You really should, 'cause if your baby's born tomorrow, he's gonna have the same birthday as Buttmud Brooks, my old roommate. Did you hear that? Buttmud Brooks. Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart. Five minutes apart. So the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call, 'cause she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant. Stop watching me. Okay, crazy. I have some better things to do with my day, like sell printers. Now till friday, That's a big deal. While we're on, why don't I run you down to the hospital - do a quick check? - Not till midnight. Guys A word of advice, speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr., after my father, until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds. You said it was your younger brother. My brother was born, my parents felt he better exemplified this name, so they gave it to him. I was given "Andrew," which they got out of a baby-name book. - How's it going? - It's getting really crowded in here. You should go back to work, 'cause the day's not out yet. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore. I feel like this noise is gonna prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals. Actually, the distractions are good. I'm not gonna make it till midnight if I'm sitting here thinking. Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes. Five seconds! Right now, conference room. Topic Potpourri. Let's go. I'm sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think what were the first 13 colonies? The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on in her body. - Can we do sleight-of-hand tricks? - I will allow that. Can anyone do those? I'm gonna go look at the internet. All right. That's a good one. Sorry, guys. Keep talking. You are a woman warrior. Thanks, Kelly. Does anybody have anything Anything interesting, any hobbies, special skills? This is the only time I'll make this request. I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in the breakfast club. I don't think anybody wants. I can do the "evolution of dance" dance. That sounds good. Do you need some music or? Actually, music would just throw me off. I need complete silence, okay? You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm gonna have to start over. "Evolution of dance" dance. "You let me in your bed, "but now I sleep alone, "trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home." Affirmed, Seattle slew, secretariat, citation, assault, count fleet, whirlaway, war admiral, Omaha, Gallant Fox I know this. The jockey was Johnny Loftus, sired by Star Shoot. Good afternoon. Have a seat. What is it? Before we conceive a child, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract. Of course. It's been a long time since we've come down here separately. - I was thinking - Let's get to it, shall we? "Item one, child will be breast-fed by the mother "for six months, then weaned "onto a nutrient-rich winter-vegetable mash "provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, here after referred to as Morpheus." Agreed? Agreed. Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another and you are going to be there. For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra-feast! You know what? I'll give Dr. Rezvani a quick call. - He'll know - Happy thoughts here, happy times. Happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times. Jim, as a matter of fact I printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things, we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one. "Stimulate the nipples". Nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle. Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt. I have a shirt like that in my car. Why don't you go get it? The second one is "walk around". We're already doing the opposite of that Perfect. Three, "eat spicy foods". The opposite Stick spicy food up her butt. Let's go to the hospital now. I love you, but you're distracting me from my distractions. Great. Well, sorry. - Why don't you work? - I will do that. Sorry. I feel a bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. I know. You don't like to be frazzled. I don't. By the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally. - Someone's freaking. - A little frazzled. He is. I know Pam better than anyone in here, and obviously she's gone crazy. But everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But no. She's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. "Five to seven minutes." "Five to seven minutes." "Six minutes." Different, but not really. "Five to seven minutes." "Acceptable names include and are limited to Ebenezer " - Jebediah. - "Honus." Jedediah. "Worf." No Star Trek names. Fine. - What if it's a girl? - Irrelevant question. Section 5-a, "child shall be male." I cannot control that. You can't put that in here. You can. It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex and then extremely cold for five months. Absolutely not. I won't get in the car, because you'll try to drive me to the hospital. You know me too well. Everything is fine. Don't worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay? Did you say "she"? I called the doctor a week ago. I couldn't wait. God, don't be mad. Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl. We're having a little girl. I know. All right. - Well, I definitely feel better. - Good. All right. Did you change? My water broke. All right. It's time Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please. Is it midnight yet? No, it's 4:35. Right. Almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex, like, 7 and 1/2 hours later. But you'd to have the afternoon delight. Sometimes you have to go for it. - Let's go to the hospital, shall we? - Not yet, Michael. - We can - It's almost time for ultra-feast! Where's Kevin? What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital? That's Fancy Feast. "Ultra-feast" is something they made up so they can pig out in the name of ceremony. What is Octoberfeast? There's no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there. Our ultra-feast menu's theme Hollywood. We have ratatouille from Ratatouille, and Tandoori chicken from Born into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I Are you okay? I'm fine. - Are you sure? - The doctor said that it's still concidered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it! I think this feast is over, and it's time to go to the hospital. - Time to go? - That's right. - Let's give it a shot. - It's better. That wasn't even the worst of 'em I'm fine. - Go to the hospital. - They're not that bad still. - No, it's passing. It's fine. - Let's go to the hospital. - Michael says we should go now. - Yeah, I think we should head out. - It passed. It's good. - You know what? I'm not asking anymore. - Babe, I'm not going. - We need to go. Come on, come on! No, I'm not going! I am not going, okay? I'm not going today! Because I can't do it. I don't think I can do it. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding? If anyone can do this, you can do this. You can do this. You can do this. Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared. - I'm scared too. - I'm petrified. But the best news is we're gonna have a baby today A really awesome baby. We're gonna have a baby. - So let's have it at the hospital. - Let's do that. - How we doing on contractions? - Two minutes apart. - I told you - It's okay. I told you to warn me at 5 minutes. We waited too long. We waited too long. Two minutes doesn't do us any good. - What happened to four and three? - We're okay. - Pamela, you know what time it is? - I don't want to have my baby here. You're not. You know where you're going. - The hospital. - Yes. And what you're gonna have? A baby. We're gonna have a baby in hospital. I got it! Everybody, it's go time! Action stations! Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, a bottle of water. - Erin, call an ambulance, please. - Ambulances are emergencies only. You call the ambulance, I call the cops. - We're driving ourselves, actually. - You are in no condition to drive. I will drive you! Check! Got it! All right, I have my wallet. - Go-bag's in the car. - Where's my go-bag? - Keys I need my keys! - There's nothing in it. You are telling me now that there is nothing in it! Great! - Should I bring a dictionary? - The hospital will provide them. - Bring a thesaurus. - Has anyone checked how dilated she is? - This is ridiculous. - Get away. Let Jim do that, please. - I didn't know we had a tape measure. - We don't. I can't find my keys. I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here. - Here we go! - Here we go! Good luck! Wish me luck! Have fun! It's 5:00. Here we go! Here we go! On our way! - Hold it! - Come on, Stanley. - We're goin' now. - One more Out! Out! Idiot. - What is the traffic like? - Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!

I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. Got a lot of responses Mostly creeps. Made a few friends. - Here we go. You're doing great! - Just breathe. - She'll be here soon. - She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised. - Stop texting! - Michael, come on! I'm texting about you, okay? All right Let's move! - Pull over! - You're kidding me! Pull over! You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer. Don't make this difficult, Dwight. Wait Wait! My iPod's not in here! It has the birth song on it. I know, but my iPod is in the go-bag. We'll be fine. I don't want the first thing she hears to be the 8 mile soundtrack. - What do you wanna do? - Let's go by the house and get it. - It's only 20 min past the hospital! - Pam, no. Are you nuts? - We're going to the hospital now. - Guys, stop fighting. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? You know what? I am all over this. Here we go. Ready? Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday. Then why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept I.M.ing you how bored I was. Go to my house, get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is underneath I don't need a key. But if you do need a key, just listen, it's under No, don't, don't. Don't tell me. Dwight, just listen to me! - Do you have everything, guys? - Michael, just go park the car. All right. - Dunder Mifflin. It's okay. - You can't park here. I just did. Pam's doing great. She's ten inches dilated now Sorry, meters Centimeters. And she's also fully effaced, which I don't know what that is. But no baby yet. It's only been 6 And I was sent out for some ice chips, 'cause I might have passed out. - These are very refreshing, very good. - Daddy. She's ready to push. Where's my little nibblet? Halpert, room D-1. All right. Family only beyond this point. Thank you! There we go. You're doing great. Push again. - Not yet. - No, don't push. Pull. - Why don't you get some more ice chips? - No, Jim, stay! Really push this time, Pam. Nope, not yet, not yet, not yet. Gotta go wash my eyes. That kid's gonna have a lot of hair. - Have you guys seen her? - She hasn't popped yet. Damn it! She was supposed to come out yesterday. I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back 55 bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now have to switch it with today's paper. But you don't know that. We could be here another half an hour. What could you possibly have to do? I have an ice cream cake in the car. Oh, my God! Go, go! Are you insane? All right. Guys? You're doing great. - Just relax. - Sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an E.T.A - When this is gonna - This isn't happening! You're starting You're kinda losing 'em. Look at her. Pam, she's so beautiful. That's right. It's a baby, see Sir, you can't smoke that in here. - Put it Put it out. - All right. Can't smoke anywhere these days. She's incredible. You wanna count her fingers and toes again? No. Let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still 12 of each. Her name is Cecilia Marie Halpert. - 11 pounds - She's 7 pounds Mother and daughter are doing great. Congratulations. - Here. - Hey, grandma's back. It was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee. Thank god. I haven't had caffeine in nine months. May I? - Somebody has a full diaper. - Let me get it. I am a diapering master. I've done little else in the past 2 months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you. Where's the baby? I want to see the baby! Lene. Hi. My goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma. How are you? I worry about you. You know, I think I think it's time for me to go. - Love you. - Love you, as a friend. Love you, mom. I want to hold the baby! You just have to use the hand sanitizer first. Right. Again. No pants. Ready? That's so weird. She was saying it just before you got here. Yesterday I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find was mold and lots of it. I did what anyone would do. I read a book, I had a bath. I got a good night's sleep and made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets. Time to get to work. There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were "insurmountainable". I made a family. I got these two together, and I made a family. This man has a gift! Who else is single? I'm not single. I have a man. I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you too. Why don't you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs? Show of hands Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? Who else? Come on, people. I know models. Plus-size models maybe. You got that right. Meredith, come on. You're obviously single. You know it. I am never getting married. Like Clooney. Andrew, what about you? Torn scrotum Still on the mend, so Not good timing. Yes, I'm gonna ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible. When you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love. Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents? We were just kids. What did we know? How we doing? - Good. - Great. Would you like me to take her to the nursery? - Doesn't she sleep here? - She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot. I think we'll be okay. Great. Big yawn. - Ready? One, two, three. - One, and then wrap around. It's okay. It's okay. - Hold that arm down. - I can't. She's too strong. Careful, though. You don't wanna break it. She's not gonna Pam, I got it. - All right. - Go. - Arms out. - Nurse? - How you doing? - I don't know. I can't tell if she's getting anything. - Really? - It doesn't feel right. You're pushing the milk out, right? How would one do that? Wasn't it It's kinda like a Like Like that. - Do you wanna try it, Jim? - I think you're good. You're doing a good job. - Somebody buzzed. - Really? Must have sat on it, Pam. I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right. Maybe we should take a break. I can take her to the nursery, bring her back and try again later. Even if she's not getting anything? She'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle once we're in the nursery. No. I read in the book about nipple confusion. Oh, good. You know everything. I mean, she's just She's really tentative about latching. And I just I wanna keep her self-esteem up. I'll bring her back in a little while, and we can try again, okay? All right. - It's gonna be all right. - Maybe it'll be good, 'cause then she can, like, socialize with the other babies. No. Yeah, that would That would be good. - You wanted to see me? - What would you say if I told you that I was about to change your life. Oh, boy. What's that sound? I would like you to meet your new boyfriend. - I don't know what to say. - Say nothing. You will learn to love me. Hold on. You gotta let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together. Would you have lunch with me? Good! - Can I talk to you privately? - Sure. Kevin, please leave. I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not I like Andy. This is going to kill Kevin. - I'm sure he'll be fine. - I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant, when he was 17, - had some problems - Really? No. Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive, and it won't kill Erin to just go, have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him. I bet his heart is enlarged, though. - I don't want anyone to die. - Just don't let him sit on you. I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him. She touched my shoulder. Hey, guys, we're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy. Hi. Sorry. So sorry. Careful. She just shoves the nipple right in there. I know. Did you see that? I'm pretty sure she's Did you grow up around here? You must have grown up around somewhere else? Why was I hiding behind the plant? In college, I took a botany class, there was lots of drama in that class. Kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botany class. And then they would say things like, "This guy's gonna fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out at them and confront them and be like, "You think all I do is hide behind plants "and spy on people?" Busted. The reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and I was jealous. Hi. I'm Clarke. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant. - That would be great. - That would be really great. - When's she available? - Actually, I'm the consultant. "Got milk?" All right Let's see what we're workin' with. The biggest thing Besides not being able to get her to latch Here, I'll get that for you. Is that I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything. Let me feel here. Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand? When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a "C". - Does that hurt? - No, I mean, - It feels pressure. - Sure it doesn't hurt? No. It just feels like pressure. See how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that. You can stimulate it. All right, so you just wanna do that, and that will - Perfect. - The baby should grab onto that. She will. I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if - We'll figure it out - Probably. Why don't you bring your baby over here? She's beautiful. - Congratulations. - Thank you. You're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you, okay? Please do. Shoot. Shoot. She fell off. - Try the torpedo thing. - Will you grab Clarke real quick? No need. I saw him do it. I can try it. Jim, please, please. I think it would be weird if you did it. That makes sense. I'll just go get the other guy. Hey, what's up, kid? Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I prepared for you? Nothing left to do except dot the "I"s, the "J"s, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon? - I look forward to it. - Very well. Jim, get her. Get the baby. Get her, come on. I know, I know. Come here. Oh, boy. - All right. - I got her. She latched. She latched. - That's amazing. - Oh, my god. - I didn't have to do the "C" thing. - That's awesome. We're doing it. That's great. We're really parents now. Erin would like a few words with you. - I have enjoyed our time together. - Me too. - I wanna continue our friendship. - It's been really fun. Because I think a friendship could be a really cool thing. Yeah, me too. And you're my friend. I hope that I'm your friend. Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Do you really think that you could have dated Erin? You said she liked me. Even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place. - I've done better than Erin. - No. Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael. Lynn was as hot as Erin. Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you. This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, whereas you Nice going. Knock, knock. Hey, Isabel. Pam, she's gorgeous. Oh, my Can I hold her? She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just Let me burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. - Look at you. - Come here, sweetie. - Oh, my God! - What? - Wrong baby. - What? Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Oh, my gosh. Has she been fussing long? - No. Not at all. - Perfect. I was out like a light. She's not hungry. How's it going? I feel like she needs to eat, but she just won'tatch on, which is weird, because the other baby did it Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. - So you excited to take your baby home? - We definitely are. At 3:00, right? - You said we could stay till 3:00? - Yeah, you can. But it's 2:35. - Half hour. - Well, 25 minutes. - And you're all set with the car seat? - Yes. Car seat's right there. - That bottom part goes in the car. - The whole thing goes in the car. I'll be back in 25 minutes. Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be. Can we get a late checkout? I don't I don't think she heard me. What are you doing here? Isabel. Hello. Kitchen was disgusting, so New cabinets. All I did was bring macaroni and cheese. Where's the fridge? It's in the backyard. I'll take this. I'll let you get back to it. Listen, I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by some time for a teeth cleaning, you know, just for fun. Adults are supposed to go to the dentist too. Are they, now? How some people spend their money. Right? I'll call you, kid. Do that. You really sure we should be leaving? But you hear the baby crying, right? - Where's your car? - It's in the lot. A lot of fathers bring the car around. Right. That'd be a smart thing to do. - Pam, I will be right back. - Okay. Please hurry. I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, I'm gonna stand here and wait for the confirmation. Good. The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me? "From Andy." And the number is our office fax number. It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, I'll give you the confirmation in a bit? Sorry. That's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired. You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day, and it Just read the fax. You read the fax! I'm asking you out. Oh, my God. That's amazing.

Mornin' darlin'. - Morning. Well, this is my last day at the scranton branch For a while.

My dogs love peein' in that snow. Makes me think they're on to somethin'. Oh, good mornin', sweetheart. Good morning, honey pile. I'm sorry, but is that a gift I see in your hands? It is. This is a little something for you to remember Your time here in scranton by. - Is that a lump of coal? - Yes, it is. Have I been that naughty? No, no, no. That is a good gift, actually. Uh, buildings here in scranton Are literally powered by coal. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. We, we don't get much coal down in tallahassee. I mean, just alligators And some of the worst chinese food you've ever tasted. Mm, that sounds great, actually. Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, You've got a place to stay. When you work for sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser Or you practice bestiality, If jo likes you, you are in. And I am in. Erin go bragh. Andy go bragh to you. Nice kilt. Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt. Erin and I have our first date tonight And it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to how I met your mother, That's the datthat your kids Are gonna wait patiently to hear about, And you'd better have a good story for them. - No. - Great. - No. - Thank you. No, no, no, no, no. Ooh, come on, come on, five more minutes. Five more minutes of mega-desk. Please. Is this yours or mine? They say that no man is an island. False. I am an island. And this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt With the molten hot lava of strategy. Good lord. I can't believe I'm missing this. It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, Like a half snarl, half smile. I get the sense that she's very ironic. Okay. Love you. I'll talk to you. Must be amazing being a father, right? The miracle of life? It is, big time. Ah, that baby is just discovering A whole wide world right now. It's pretty amazing. What up is, what down is, who mom is. Who dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on. Oh, it's tough being here for a lot of reasons. I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that The refrigerator is its father. Is that what happened to you? I'll tell you wh happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father And my wet nurse was my mother. That's a common mistake. Turned out fine for me, but mose, OhSame story, different ending. Hey. Are you sick? Oh, no, I'm fine. I just have a little indigestion. In your nose. Yes. I'm a little sick, But I don't wanna miss my date with andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick, it goes away within a few hours. Except once when I was in the hospital From age three to six. Now after all the talkin' I've been doin', It's your turn. This is a town hall meetin'. I wanna hear what y'all sound like. - That is a great idea, jp. - Thank you. You know, I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I wanna hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that liquid paper-- That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist. Oh, jo, I have an idea for suntan lotion soap. You know, it's doesn't have to be an invention. I have a question. Oscar, homosexual accountant. In the training manual, it says that There's a minority executive training program in tallahassee. I am so proud of sabre's print in all colors initiative. Any sabre employee of color is welcome to apply. Okay. Darryl? Darryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse. - Okay, hush now. - Okay. The sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, But printers and paper ship differently. It would be faster to deliver them separately Instead of waiting on everything to come in. You wouldn't need more trucks? I mean-- Not at all. There's a way it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs. Oh, look at you. Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job. We're very proud of you. You know what, we are going to tape that up On the refrigerator in the kitchen. I like this, darryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketchin' upstairs. Would you like an office up here? - Are you serious? - Yeah. Take jim's old office. Oh, um, I set my stuff up in there. So Just give me a few minutes to clean it out for you. Yeahi wanna hear more from you. - Absolutely. - All right. - Yeah, thank you. - Okay, any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leavin' tonight. This is your last chance for a while. No, say it's not so, jo, we're gonna miss you! We're gonna miss you so much! Yes, well, okay. Florida ain't that far away. Yeah, well, I'm heading down there. Well, anytime now. So-- How about July 4th weekend? Oh, honey, you didn't buy a ticket. I did. Oh, honey, I'm not, uh, home very often. And, um, you know, my relatives They take up the guest house. I think you should check with my office Before you book any dates, okay? You know what, In the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats On a bunch of different flights. But there are a couple flights That only have two tickets left, So I think we should pull the trigger right-- Enough! All right, everybody, Just try to put a brave face on. Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes michael, Jo invites michael to house, Jo doesn't like michael anymore Mm. Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed and I am taking you to lunch. No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set. No is not an option. Yes, it is. All right. Well, if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no. How many knocks does it take To get you to do some work? Okay. I'll be over there. And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you Printer cartridges and toner now. - Oh, jim. - Yeah. Jim. Sorry to bother you. My headphones are broken. - Right. Can I listen to my music at a low volume? that's great, great. - Okay? - Yeah. Cradle and the silver spoon   little boy blue and the man in the moon   when you coming home dad I don't know when  Dwight, stop. Can you stop that?  we will be together then  Can you grow up?  you know we'll have a good time then  Oh, well, whether it's, uh-- Whether it's this time or the next time.  the cat's in the cradle   and the silver spoon   little boy blue and the man in the moon  No, we can definitely talk about it in the next-- You know what, can I call you back? That would be great, thank you.  we're gonna have a good time  No, I know I need to work. I just I feel weird not being home. I'm not surprised that dwight's using my baby To steal my desk. But I'm a little surprised that it's working. This fax came for you. Oh, no, no, no. Are you feelin' ill? Uh. Oh, no, honey. If you've got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting callie and jo, jr. Sick. These dogs have gotta be in a commercial With dwight howard next week. Oh. No, I feel like I could lift a car. Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself And get in bed? And shred that and have him send me a clean fax, all right? Oh, well-- She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on a date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right? Yes? I was just working at my desk, And I wanted to run some new leads by you. Oh. You're sick. dang it. That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home. No, no, no, no, no. Gettin' everybody sick in the office. I don't need any heroes here, honey. It's time for you to go on home now. You sure? Yeah, you'd probably feel better Once you get some pants on. Come on. - Very nice. - Not bad, huh? A real hoop dreams story you got there. Oh, man, you seem to have caught jo's eye. How did you make that happen? I impressed her with my good ideas. Seriously, how did you do it? I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there. How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something In terms of a past injustice? Now mike, I have to ask you to leave So that I can learn about this tiny television. Okay. All right. - Hey, there. - Hey, there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you wanna chat, like we were doing earlier. Well, there's chattin' time and there's workin' time. And I'm still on workin' time. Mm, well, the clock says chattin' time, so-- Well, if you feel like you've done a solid day's work. Right. What? Well, I mean, if you can put your name on this day And be proud of the amount of work you've done, Then by all means, you should toodle on home. Mm. Mm. Oh, well Is there something else I can help you with? No, no, no. That's super clear-ish. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Just because jo has no life does not mean That the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life, I think ryan has a life. This is outrageous. - Hey, pac-man. - Hey, what's up, butt plug? How are you doing, stud? You already there? Dude, I've been here since 3:00. I've boot and rallied twice. How's the lady situation? Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance. Ah, damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately, I am stuck here Because my boss is making us work late. Oh, here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, Borrow some balls and come meet me! Yeah, maybe next year. Maybe next queer! Hey, ladies, who wants some bangers and mash? - Oh, andy. - Hi. I'm in my jammy jams. That's okay, I'm in my worky works. You look amazing. Oh, thanks. Come in. - Okay. Hey. Me and creed are in. Are you guys in? Oh, I'm in. - I'm in. - All right. Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman In tallahassee by slackin' off. you do it by workin' hard. Or marryin' rich. And I did both. Ah. Got a little client meeting at shanny o'gannigans tonight, But it shouldn't go all night long. So if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house So the baby can experience a strong male presence. No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.   Hi there, jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um-- This evening, I have-- Hello. Hey, jo, it's jim halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 With a very important client. And it's so weird, 'cause we never have meetings after 5:00 p.M. But I was hoping that maybe just this once it would be okay. Well, sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers. You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this. - Okay. - Okay. All right. Sorry, sugar. What did you want? Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting with a client. I'm gonna just reschedule for next week. Thank you. Thanks again, by the way. Hey, what are you fellas doing up here? We here to bust you out. - I wish, but, uh-- - dude. Your shirt tucked in? oh, yeah. Um. I must have did that when I used the bathroom. All right, then, uh, let me get to it. All right. See you later. - Your hand's cold. - It is, I'm sorry. Yeah, have some more blanket. Oh, thanks. - What's up? - Whoa! You're awake? Andy, this is my brother, reed. I didn't know you had a brother. He's my foster brother. Well, any brother of erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy bernard. Cold hands. Are we rotating seats or-- Well, yeah, you're the guest. Go take the easy chair. Best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork And her smelly feet. Hey, my feet aren't smelly. They smell like roses. Smell them. Oh. So how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent, or-- None. We were in the same house from ages 10 to 12, And then from 15 to 18. All right. Formative years. nice skirt. It's a kilt.   Oh. Sorry, sorry. Sorry.   Yes, I am anxious to get out of work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate st. Patrick's day. It's so I can protest st. Patrick's day. Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carryin' nothing but my sable gloves. I've had it with homeland security. And I want you to put all those trackin' numbers In my blackberry. How late are we gonna work tonight? You never know with jo. Sometimes we're here till midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days. Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you where your schedule is? Yeah. That'd be awesome. I could get a girlfriend Wouldn't have to go to amsterdam seven times a year. But, uh, I'm young, right? I will date when I'm dead. Okay. Do I really wanna turn out like gabe? No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned 30. That's just-- That's just depressing. Hello, jo. Anything I can do for you, puddin'? There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sort of late. It's 8:30. And it's st. Patrick's day. Which is a world ethnic holiday, So I have decided I am going to dismiss my employees. Hmm. I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, Both the quality and the quantity. Great performance, very, very solid all the way arod. All right, then. Okay, happy . Patrick's day. And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to tallahassee. Although I do look forward To our professional relationship. - Michael. - Yes. I look forward to that too. - Okay. - Ooh. - It's coming down out there. - Yes. Thank you for coming all the way here. No-- I'm sorry I was so sick. Ah. Oh, great, now I'm gonna get sick. Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, guys. Hey. - How are you? Drinks are on me. Oh, no, no, put your credit cards away, It's on us. - Oh-ho! All right! Did I mess up my career today, my future prospects at sabre? I don't know. There is a chance, yes. I tell ya, I love my job. But jo wants me to put on a show for her And pretend to work late? Ah. I spent all day trying to make her like me, And I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her? As the irish poet bobby mcferrin said, "don't worry, be happy." Whoops. Okay. Okay. All right. Best night ever. What the hell's going on back there? Yeah. Uh, we should be able to have that over to you by Monday.
Hey, jim, jim! Come here. Do you know who that is? - No. - Look at him. Look at him, t-shirt, jeans. - Is it you? - I am flattered. That's johnny depp. - Where'd you take that? - In my condo complex. Oh, my god, that's right! I read in people magazine That he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in scranton. I'm flippin' out, man. Hey, jim, jim, Where-where do I find the black pearl? - Who's that? - Captain jack sparrow. captain jack sparrow, jim. John dillinger. No. I'm captain jack sparrow. Captain crunch. Okay. Okay. Screw you, halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt When you thought you'd seen roger clemens? At the yankees game. - Yeah. Well, it wasn't him. - I had A little better reason to believe that You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because johnny depp In your condo complex I know. I know! It also explains why The name on his mailbox was m. Shulman. M. Night shulman? First up, the lost and found Has gone missing. It itself is lost. So please try not to lose anything Until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel- When are we getting to sales topics? Yeah. What about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate? Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that sabre has spent $50,000 to get From a market research company Are not here yet. Oh, man But will be Damn it! No, no, no, no. Meeting's not over. But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here? No sales topic, per se. Well, then no andy bernard, per se. I agree. - Dwight. Sorry. Michael, I got calls to make. I would like your undivided attention, please. You couldn't handle my undivided attention. Over the last few weeks, Things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team, And the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up. Because the way this place used to work was Make friends first, make sales second, Make love third In no particular order. Listen, michael, About what happened earlier Yeah? When I was asking about the leads. Mm-hmm. Is there any news on the leads? Is that all you have to say to me? Yeah. You got any news on the leads? Okay, I tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! All right, dwight out! Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say jesus is king of kings? Well, what does that say to you About how I think of myself? do you not answer emails anymore? Because I've emailed you four times Asking you to come to my desk. Honey, if I don't have time to answer an email, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk. Wow wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big check. - Oh, sorry, o-one second. - Stop sexting pam. I'm trying to congratulate you. This is actually a big potential sale, so You writing your memoirs over there? You writing your name over there? Well, it's a pretty big check. It's good, you know, with the kid. Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. All right, here we go. Michael - I'm just saying that- - michael Great. Teddy, nice. Let me just write that down real quick. pencil. Get me a pencil. H- hang on, teddy. I'm making a sale. - Mm-hmm. - Sales. - Mm-hmm. There's other pencils in this office. Gimme-I- Honey and jelly sandwich time. - Mike- - oh You gotta be kidding me. Look at that-that's- I know who did that. You saw who did this, and you didn't stop 'em? Didn't have to see. It was sales-I can feel it. They are out of control. The sales department smashed my sandwich. Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, mike. You gotta do something about them. You don't get it. You need to get back on top. That's what she said. - Yeah. - Yeah. Something came for you, michael. Thank you very much. What'd you get? Ah. It's just the stupid leads. - All right! - Oh, about time. Yeah! Me likey! Yeah, finally, michael. Hand 'em over, numb nuts. But seriously, I mean, it's your job to give us those leads. All right. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinkin'? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place, And you don't. Not even sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kinda sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk. I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face. I am sick of your uppity attitude Jim. I think I am not going to give these to you. Yeah! We need those leads, michael. That's our job, michael. Michael! Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give 'em out. Then we are just rewarding their bad behavior. Okay, just imagine That instead of going to jail for murdering someone, You got an ice cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, Everyone would go around killing people For-for the pleasure of an ice cream cone. Michael, I don't want To "incentivize" murder. But we've tried to make it clear That our policy emphasizes sales staff- They act like I have no power. But you do. You are in charge - Thank you. - Of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, michael. Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that. - Okay, good. - Exactly that. - Good. - Exactly that. Why do you keep repeating- Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads. So I am going to give the leads to King creed. - What- - what are you- And to king Meredith! They aren't sales people. And to king angela. Because today we are all kings. And queens. What the hell do you think you're doing? I am giving them the leads, phyllis. - Hey. - Hey. So I'm gonna go ahead and save you some time And tell you that no one's gonna go along with this. But you knew that, right? - Mm-hmm. - All right. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, And I'll start making some calls? Okay. Hey, all right. All right. Ah. These aren't leads. What are they? Oh, right. Those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I'm trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, And kids don't respect the father Who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic? I don't even think you understand it. I do understand it. This one's a map. Or is it? Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my email. Are you gonna give me the leads or not? I'll give you the leads But you know what? It's gonna cost you some clerical work. - What are these for? - It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. And when you're done, you can watch me shred them. Right I want to watch the kardashians, okay? I don't want to watch- it's mindless! The kardashians is a good show. - Thank you, stanley! - No, you don't even know! How would he even know the kardashians? It's about a family, a real-life family. No, stanley, do you- Hey, baby, what's up? I am currently reading incoherent riddles On blue index cards to find vital information That michael has hidden all over the office. How are you? Uh, nothing but vomit and diapers over here. Oh, my god. I couldn't envy you more. Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies That's just unfair. How 'bout this one? "when arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, A certain manager will go to his moppy place. " He means his mopey place. It's under that street lamp That he thinks was in casablanca. God, I love you. Today I turned an office crisis Into a teachable moment. A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally. I can imagine some yokel sitting behind his desk, Saying, "oh, yeah, take a lead. We're nothing. " Some people shouldn't be in this business. Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads Since I'm a jerk salesman. Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. I hid the leads. where? Colder. Cold Er. Warmer. Colder. Colder. C- Warmer. Warmer Hot! Hotter Burning hot! Lower - Are you- - lower Are you sure? Low Er What are you doing, idiot? Michael's stupid scavenger hunt. Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. "the treasure you seek is in the parking lot Under the first president"? Lincoln. The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha. It involves you too. The leads are in?! Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me When the leads came in. Well, big shot, if you want to find your leads, Go to the man who never breeds. kevin. Damn it! Kevin! Give me those leads. Where are they-come on! You are never going to find them. - Really? - I'm going to enjoy this. Gimme the leads! Where are the leads? Gimme the leads! I'm still enjoying it! - Where are they? - They're in the trash. They're in the trash. the trash. It's code. All right, meredith. Take off your dress. Okey-dokey. No. Dear god, no. It's in the trash can. In the kitchen. It's coming off either way. Clean sack. - Oh What- - I emptied it in the dumpster. It had toby's baba ganoush. If we don't patronize The only syrian restaurant in town, There'll be nothing left but pan pizzas And, you know Make your own salads. It's empty! - Wait. What day is today? - Um Tonight is ghost whisperer So Friday. Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! No, no, no! Hey, hey! Wait! Okay, you know what? Let's just go to the dump, Start looking. Ryan, come on. Shotgun in my car. Michael, why would we all go to the dump? Why? Because I am not going to call sabre And say, "hi, you know those very valuable, "expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? "well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, They're now in the city dump. " Not your staff, michael. You. Well, that's not the way it's gonna sound. Here's what we'll do. We'll go to the dump. We'll look around. Then we'll all go out and get pizza, Maybe catch a movie, late-night drink. Some more pizza, call it a night. Does it have to be pizza? Can we go for a falafel? - Really? - I'm not going. You did this, not us. Okay, no. You encouraged it. You were complicit. Complicit. You were all " successories. " That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. I wish I could go. - You can. - I can't. You know that. Okay, fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself. I'll go, michael. 'cause you'll just screw it up. This place has gone to hell. You know, dwight, there was a time You'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity To look through a dump with me. Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak. Yeah. Well, sometimes the acorn just stays an acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters. You're adorable. You need to go for it. I'm gonna be like mad at you if you don't- Yeah, whatever. Whoo. Can't wait for this day to be over. - Why? - Just all the drama. - What drama? - Between the Us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right? - So unnecessary. Oh, good. Thank god you said that. If the salesmen weren't acting like Such a bunch of stuck-up losers, Then this day wouldn't be so bad. Did you ever think of that? I have new baby pictures. Jim. Don't use your cute baby to make us like you. She's wearing a onesie. stop it. If we act nice now, Then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly. Didn't we kind of start it? I think you're remembering that wrong. Yeah. I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, And if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from india. Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable And maybe heading for something bad? All those who agree say aye. Aye. - Aye. - All those opposed? - I don't think we need opposed. You've changed, man. Oh, why, 'cause I have a shot at a 100k commission? When do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent. Hey, there is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes. No, no, no, I'm talking about your personality, dwight! Okay, when I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from ivan schotsky- The ivan schotsky. And if I had assistant-managed him- Assisted to the managed him. Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at a home depot! - Yeah. - Okay?! 'cause they promote from within! Instead, I had to follow you. You're going nowhere. You think you would have done better without me. Really? - I hitched my wagon To a horse with no legs. Wow! okay! Man! When I think about all the time that I wasted Being your friend I shouldn't have been hanging out Watching karate movies with you! Kung fu movies! I- you know what I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars finding my soul mate, Finding my wife, making babies. Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars! That's my wife you're talking about, man! Your made-up wife who doesn't exist? You watch it! If I'd wanted to hit you, I would have hit you. Don't do it! No, no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, boy. Wait-time out, time out, time out! Time in. - No! Don't-don't even think about that. Stop it! Give it- that's my spool! What's the least we can do to make this okay? I'll text pam. She's really good at this stuff. Yeah. I'll text erin. She's really good at this stuff too. I guess we could give them some of our new commissions. That is a dangerous precedent. Pam texted back saying we could give them all ipods. Uh, if they don't have an ipod by now, They really don't want one. All right. Then we're back to cash. And I gotta say If giving a small percentage of our commissions Is gonna smooth all this over, I'm for it. - Okay, fine, cash it is. - Oh. Erin just texted me back. "people love shells from faraway beaches. " Okay, dwight. All right, dwight. Here we go! Here we go! Oh, god! Oh Oh Oh We're never gonna find those leads, are we? Nah. Wow. Amazing, isn't it? No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers But not like this. So how 'bout, guys, Instead of 2? What do you- - no, no, we agreed. Okay. Hey, everybody. Nice spread. We get it- you eat like royalty. No, no. This is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is really sorry. Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.

They've accepted Our simple offer of treats only, nothing more. Oh. This is nice. All of us back together. This Why would somebody throw that out? Pfft! Waste. Hey. You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple much? - Yeah, she does. She loves purple. Does it stink? - Yeah. Know what would be a great picture here? - Hmm? - Just this whole dump, And in the middle, one flower. - Mm-hmm. - That's it.

Only problem is, pam's at home with the baby, And I think she wants a night in. Oh, baloney. Good one. Ring her up. Absolutely. I will do that right now. I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing.

Erin, I need you to fax this And get me a confirmation, pronto. are you going later? Sure, if you are. Yes. Talk to me that way again and I'll cut your face off! Whoa. We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um But we're kinda keeping it quiet for now. 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, And we just don't want all the drama. Exactly. 'cause when everyone knows-- Uh That's actually pretty funny, But in general, you know. Quiet. Hey, boss man. Yes? A bunch of us are going to get some drinks--you in? Ladies and gentlemen, it is quitting time. I'm sorry, I meant later. Okay. For happy hour? Yes, sure. No, I got that. Trying to get a head count. I am in. All right. Yes! It's a deal. It's a deal. Oh, hey, I invited my friend julie. Okay. I want her to meet michael. Why? They're both single. I have a sense they might-- You've been gone for a long time. It is not that. Kevin! Oh! Yeah! Hey, how are you? Oh, I missed you so much. Aww Yeah! Yeah. Waaaaah! Raaaaaaa! Waaaaaaa! When a new mom hears a baby cry, Her you-know-whats fill up with you know what, And then her shirt gets, you know That would be funny. Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my god! Easy. It's not a birthday. It's not a good-bye party. Oh, hey Pam and I are gonna go play pool With one of her friends, And we need a fourth. Sucks to be you. Would you like to be our fourth? That would be sublime. All right. So the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, "I'll call this a deck "if it'll make you happy, But this is just a porch without a roof." It was ridiculous, man. It was like--you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs. Hey, michael. Yes. This is my friend julie. Hello. How are you? Good. Hi. What is a nice girl like you hanging out With these bums for? There you go. Julie laughs at everything. So you work with pam and jim? Oh, no, no. Pam and jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired. I should hope not. No. No, not really. Not really, But they better not win. Hey. Hey, isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness. Of course. You want to play pool? Um I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone. Okay. And then they said the most ridiculous thing About anderson cooper Uh-huh. Which I do not have the decency to repeat. But trust me when I tell you that-- Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't isabel. Mm-hmm. At's a girl like you doing in a place like this? A girl like me is why a guy like you comes To a place like this. Ooh, I love repartee. Do you? Usually means there's a battle scene coming. So what do you do? I am an esl teacher. Really? Yeah. See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now? Are you thinking that I said "esp"? Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome. I was a little nervous when pam told me he was her boss, But he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done. So what do you think? About what? About julie. She's nice. Yeah. Yeah. So you like her? Uh, yeah, sure. So pam was right. About what? About you two hitting it off. Well, apparently michael scott is on a date. And that-- That, my friend, changes everything. My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, but heart. I know. Oh, yeah, you told me about him. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, boy. Yeah, he's all right. Hey, michael, where have you been? Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Heh! Nice one.

We're focusing, we're focusing--we can't talk. What's this game? One second. Yeah, how do you play? Guys, guys, guys, please. Game over. All right, it's all yours now. Only three tickets. If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time. Stop telling me how to spend my tickets. I know, but you wanted the big thing. Wow, can you imagine what people would say If they saw us dancing together? Oh, I know. They'd be like, "what's up with those two?" "hey, guys, get a bedroom already." "did we miss the wedding?" Um, I got it-- I'll do this, And you play the racing game, and then we'll switch. Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart. No drama. Okay. Oh, air hockey, basketball. We could play that. Oh, whac-a-mole. Any brothers or sisters? Three brothers. Really? Mm-hmm. Two are in the marines, one's a cop. Vegetarian? No. I love meat. what's your blood type? O-negative. Universal donor. Universal donor.

Excuse moi. Hey! Watch this. Ready? What are you doing? I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue. Michael, you don't have to do this. Wow. Oh, wow, that was close. I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage Because I watch reality dating shows Like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners And the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers. Hey, you two having fun? Did you tell them? No. This is exactly what I don't want--the drama. I don't want The drama! I get it. oh! You are amazing at this. How did you get so good? Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack! Whack! Whack. Say it with me. Whack! Extend the fingers more. Whack. Good. This looks like a hoot.

Nce between a chimichanga, a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back asap. It's urgent. [Laughter] This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. - [Laughs] Say, "me eat cookie." - No. I won't say it. - Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique. - It's Kevin as cookie monster from Sesame Street. - Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio? - Mm-hmm. - I love that show. - This is Kevin. This is Kevin. - Thank you. - That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please. - Yes. - Me too, Oscar. Please send it to me. [All agreeing] - C.C. Me. - Angela, this is inappropriate. - This is my favorite day. [Cheerful music]   - it's secretary's day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's secretary's day. I sent an email blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - I do. - Thank you. [clatter] - If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom. - Welcome back. - Hey, thanks. It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it? It rocked. It rocked my ass off. Oh. You couldn't have watered it? - I literally did not know that existed until this moment. - Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die. - It's nice to see you again, Dwight. - Hello, Pam. - I was just wondering what you had planned for secretary's day. - I'm going to give Erin $15. - I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch. - A one-on-one lunch with Erin? - Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. - She's kind of a rube. - That's my girlfriend you're talking about. - Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch. [Tapping desk] - She's gonna be so psyched. - Hi, Erin. Happy secretary's day. - Well, happy boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss. - I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to Lunch. - I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's. - Ugh. - Just the two of us. - Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm - Yeah, okay. Yeah, that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I thought Hayworth's, but - Okay, well, we'll figure something. - Oh. - Okay, let's go to Hayworth's. - Okay. - All right. - Have a cookie, kev. - Yeah, ha ha. Tray of cookie. I'm not falling for that. - I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there. - Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. Happy Birthday. - Thank you. - [As cookie monster] Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. [Laughter] - They're making fun of cookie monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me. Oscar, did you eat some of my m&m's? The level-- - this is violent and offensive. - Thank you. It really make me self-conscious about my voice. - It's awful. - I'm not crying. - You have some food on your face. - Do my hands feel sweaty to you? - The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. Guy. This cookie monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure. Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or email this around. - Yeah. - And that's straight from corporate. So, not to be scary, but, yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao. - Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is a novelization of the movie precious: Based on the book push by sapphire. - I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager? - I don't know. - I would have chosen the 1490s. 'Cause America was discovered. - Right. [Sighs] - And then my last job was at a taco bell express. But then it became a full taco bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my foster home, I never had a desk. So it's like--I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month? - An age or month? - Yeah, like a favorite month. Like, I like April when I was seven. - I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird. - How many pillows do you sleep on at night? - So how are things going with Andy? - He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him. - Well, let's see. Um Andy. Plays the banjo. - Yeah. I love that. - Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser. - What? - I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter. - Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela? - Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh. - Here we go. Hot plate. - Okay. - And your salad, miss. - Why wouldn't he tell me that? - I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else. - They had sex? - They were engaged, so Okay. You know what, sir? - Yes. - Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger, and there are only, like, five or six. Could I get some more pickles? - Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles. - Thank you. - They were engaged? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Uh-oh. - Well - [Moans] - What are you doing? What are you doing? - In the foster home, my hair was my room. [Exhales] [Prolonged exclaiming] - Okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now. - [Breathes heavily] [Groans] - I'll have what she's having. - Did you have a-- did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch. - Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha. - What's up? - Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable. - Dwight, don't be gross. - No, no, he's right. - Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy. - That's weird. My breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump? - All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me. - You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay? - Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you. - Mm. Meredith! - I just like the way it feels. - What are you doing? - Relax. Okay. - Relax? - This is like the Cadillac of pumps. - Give it back to me now. - Okay, I was just warming it up. - It's disgusting! - It's not a big deal. - It's not sterile! - We're both girls. Who cares? - So How was lunch? - Lunch was fine. - Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be? - I don't know. It was lunch, Andy. - Well, I know. [stammers] Just want-- I mean [Chuckles] - Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets. - God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy. [Drawer shuts] - [As cookie monster] "My name is Kevin. I'm an accountant." See, I did the voice. - That's a little derivative. - But parody is always derivative. - Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean? - Jim does a really good one. Do yours. - Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. field cookie just opened up at the mall." - Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at madtv? - "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies." - Okay. - Hey, can I have your attention, please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the party planning committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself. [Applause] - You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so - I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic. - No. No. No. - Specific shout-out - Stop talking. - Okay. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection to secretary's day in the form of that 115-pound moonbeam over there named Erin hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax confirmations, but to me, she is my girlfriend In addition to being the person who brings me my fax confirmations. So I wrote a [English accent] Little ditty that I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called secretary of love. A one, a two, a one, two, three-- [Gasping] - I know about Angela. I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her. Michael told me. - Oh, God. - Erin, can we talk about this in private? - I don't want it to be in private. Is it true or is it not? - Yes. - Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together? - No. No, never. - Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know? - Yeah, pretty much. - Pretty much. - Who are you? I don't know you. I don't know you! - I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the cookie monster issue. - Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anybody before you, I would have told you. - Thanks. - So if you need anything, I'm right over there. - "Hey, Erin, you look delicious. I mean, beautiful." - [Snickers] - Okay. Okay. There. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days. - What? What do you mean, suspend me? - I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone from work. - Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too, Jim. - [Laughs] Okay. - Fine. You too, Dwight. - Wait, what? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making. - I don't want to hear it. Suspended. - "C" is for suspension. - Why would that be something that you would talk about on secretary's day? - Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like-- that's-- that's, like, mr. And Mrs. smith crap. - I was gonna tell her, just on my own time. - You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret. - Who cares? I mean, it's not like I killed somebody. Big deal, right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me, so, if you think about it I probably should have told her, I guess. Everybody does stupid things. - Psst. Hey. Erin. - You want to talk to me, come to my desk. - You embarrassed me earlier. - Oh, take it up with the chief of police. - You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it. - I want to throw up just thinking about it. - You are throwing up for the wrong reasons. - I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different I can just put it through again, you know. - Hey. You know, I was engaged before Jim. - Really? - Yeah. And he worked here too. - It was Andy, wasn't it? - No, no, it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants. - I hope you find what you're looking for. - Thank you. - So I can reprimand them, but I can't suspend them. Oh, I can't do either. Uh-huh. Fair enough. [Phone rings] - Hey, Toby. - I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal. - Very interesting. - Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure-- - thanks, Toby. - Hey, everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad that I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And, yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension. - I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. - And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. - Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. Gabriel, I apologize. - Great. - I kneel before you. - Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. - Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. - Guys, to err is human. - Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel frankenstein? - Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Okay? I mean, yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill. - How long were you guys together? - A year. - A year? You were together for a year. - Yeah. But that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else - I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like that girl precious in precious: Based on the novel push by sapphire. Okay? - I didn't see that movie. [Chatter] - That was ugly. I'm sorry that you had to see that. - Do they still get paid? - It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened. - Sounds like they just got to go home with pay. - Yeah. - Pathetic. - Very nice. - Can I buy everyone coffees? [Muttering] "Or cookies." - Oh. - What was that? Was that an impression? - All right. - [Imitating gabe] Uh, guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in. Because corporate told me to. [Laughter] I just want you to know I laugh like a crazy person. [Laughter] - Okay. You got to be able to-- you got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang. - "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit." [Laughter] - "Ciao." Right? "Ciao. I say ciao 'cause I'm fancy from Tallahassee." [Laughter] - Why don't we say "ciao" to the impressions? All: Ciao. - Ciao. Filming. - Ciao, stick insect. All: Ciao. - God. [groans] - Erin? - Oh. Sorry. I thought everyone was gone. - No, no, I was just watching cookie monster. Finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down? - Yeah. - What's, um - I can't trust Andy anymore. - Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel-- I'm sorry I caused that thing. - It's Andy's fault. - Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. [Sighing] Oh. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She's-- she doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing, and she's, like, three feet tall. [Laughter] And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis. - Oh, I like his butt. - You said butt. - You tricked me. - Ahh! - Ahh. [laughter] You said it. - You know who'd you love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom dizemore. This is him. "Hey! Hey, Scott!" - Sometimes, telling someone something is hard. - [Shouts nonsense] - Well, at least somebody made her happy on secretary's day. - Hey, Kevin, it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping costs I made the most brilliant the retaliation video. It is so awesome. - I don't get it. - Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice. - Yeah. "I vant to count to ten." - But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers. Your an accountant too, so, it doesn't Why didn't you do Oscar the grouch that would have been funny. That would have been funny. But the Count is purple, and Oscar wears purple. Oh! Oh! I was just watching that. Did you do that man? Oscar! I am the Count Nailed him. Nailed him! Good work cookie monster. Thank you
Buenos dias, erin. Buenos dias, miguel. Hello, dunder-mifflin. No, no, no, no. Solamente, en espaÃ±ol, por favor. I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country Should learn how to speak spanish. They are our neighbors he south, An to cancun. Buenos diaz, jaime. Buenos diaz, miguel. Como estas? Ha ha! Buenos diaz, dwight! Guten tag, herr michael. I don't understand why michael Is wasting his time with spanish. I have it on very good authority That within 20 years, Everyone will be speaking german. Or a chinese-german hybrid. La telefona. El telefono. Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of spanish. So I told him to mark everything With the international symbol for gender. And, um I should have been more specific. Your office is full of genitalia. oh. Eso es lo que dice el. "that's what he says"? Damn it. Ah, angelo. Angela. Michael. Yo soy cancun. Uhh! All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, And then you go into delivery guarantee. You know, maybe there's an opportunity For a joke there. Like, umLike, "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee." Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that. Can you smell the power of halperts? Power couple. You know what? I should be getting this client, michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs. I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company. If you want people To put the best face on something, Why would you get two people Who probably have never cut the face Off of anything in their lives? that's a good point. This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together. Yeah, I think we have mplementary strengths. Hispering] I don't even know who you are anymore. Yee. Hi, uh, donna newton, here to see michael scott. Oh, hey, ms. Newton. Hi, I'm jim. How are you? Did somebody order a hooker over here? - oh, stop that. - Hi. How are you? There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is donna, The manager of sid & dexter's. And, right now, we're in the midst Of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and pam halpert. They will be assisting you today. You look exactly alike. Oh, no, we're actually married. We're not brother and sister. I have a sense about these things. All right. You have some ancestors in common Somewhere back. I knew it. You should see their baby. So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate. so it's a tradeoff. These magazines sent to me Via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo Before me. None of this is time sensitive. Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through may. Oh, yeah, thank you. Okay, I have more of them. You would have weekly confence calls With executives in corporate. A two-week training program At the yale school of management, Obviously, you would be high on the list For advancement opportunities. Sounds all right. What is this? Oh, this is "print in all colors," Sabre's minority executive training program. It doesn't just sound a'ight, It sounds amazing. I didn't say "a'ight." How do I apply? You have to be a minority. Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going? Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities. Come here. Come here. - Hmm? Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now, all of a sudden, he's cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking? Well I like the sound of this. Maybe one day I'll be sitting in michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something? One minority from this branch Is going to get into this program. Who would I prefer? Hmm The competent, hardworking one Who does things his own way, Or the malleable simpleton who can be bought For a few fashion magazines? This is the second time That you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four should feel like, I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to hell. All right? Thanks for nothing. Oh, man. White people, right? I don't know if she was white. Well, you can kind of tell from the voice. Yeah. I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, Just because of your race. Well, they say it's because of texting, But maybe you're right. I think you should consider applying For the executive minority training program. Never thought of myself as an executive before. I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many indian ceos can you think of? I can't think of any ceos, any race. You could be the indian bill gates. You could be the indian ted turner. I could be the indian julia roberts. That's not-- she's--okay. Yes. I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, And I want to show you-- There we go! Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white. Mm-hmm. And that would be a display Of the crisp, gorgeous black. Yeah. It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then she looks at the image, Then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, What is the image. She just knows that she's turned on. This is a place that I like to go To be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before. Who took the photo? - Ryan. - Oh. And that's it. That's me. That's who I am. Not bad. oh, thanks. you're not bad, either. Thank you. Ahem. Hmm. Oh, my god. Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at? You didn't see it, pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals That she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread? - No. I'll have one. Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work. Oh, really, jim? What about pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my pam. Well, all that is irrelevant. Maybe michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, She wouldn't still be here. Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20s, it would have been annoying. In my late 20s, I find it really flattering. Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it. What if I back out, And you finish the pitch with jim? What? What was that? Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways. Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, And he's gonna blow our sale. Who cares? It's not that huge a sale. Hey, the schwab guy told us to treat every sale Like it was a huge sale. Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. Good luck, wingman. How has being a minority affected you? Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents To settle down and marry an indian guy. Oh, good, and you resent this because Indian guys always wear their cell phones Outside their pants. It's so dorky. Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton strangler's in the house. Inside the house. Just put it in your pocket. Look at that. She's totally flirting with him. You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality. You ever notice you can only ooze two things: Sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya. She just crossed her arms together--that's bad. Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together To make them look bigger. Like that? Is this--is this the best you can do right there? Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of flexibility. Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, Where, if you're in charge, Then you can always get discounts For the people that you like. So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right? What's that? Maybe we find some wiggle room? I don't-- I don't think so. I think we could. I don't see how we could possibly sell these For that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost-- Okay, well, sometimes-- Sometimes it makes financial sense To lose money, right? Like for tax purposes. Actually, ran the numbers on this, And in this case, it makes more financial sense To gain money. Why don't you run them again. What if she's just flirting with you To get a better price? If she is, it's working. Yeah, michael, here's a trick. As her if she wants a mint. If she says no, then she is not interested. She does not like him. You can flirt with someone to get what you want And also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together? 'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day. I was after your money. Well, the joke was on you. Yes, it was. Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this. - Okay. Hey What are you guys doing? This girls was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. Account From a hot guy at her high school, And now I'm trying to make her anorexic. Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat. Oh, that is so good. You know, we should keep practicing for this interview. Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me. Ryan? What does he know? It's easy--you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently Because of your race? Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in. "we"? When I become executive, I'm gonna make ryan manager. And then the two of us are cleaning house. Kelly will be even worse than darryl. If you'd have told me this morning That today I'd be creating a monster Capable of my own destruction, I'd have thought you were referring To the bull mose and I are trying to reanimate. So corporate approval of this contract Is contingent upon buyer and seller - Mm-hmm. - Obtaining blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. Just kidding. - Do you like mints? Yes. I carry mints with me sometimes. - You ever tried those? - Oh, I haven't tried those. - No. - They're good. You want one? Sure. It's like cool "certified cool." I like how they say "certified." Like there's some consortium of Michael! I'm sorry. I can't stop myself from kissing her. Yeah, now you know how I feel Sitting next to those m&ms all day. Well, why don't you just move the m&ms? Well, why don't you shut up! Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane To try one more time. It is totally insane. Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker. Okay. What do you think? I think it's over, man. Andy? Ehh. Okay, some for, some against. - Nobody's for. - Pam? - Hmm? - What do you think? Um I think it's really, really unlikely. - Okay. - Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible. What? I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt. I'm going with pam's group. Wait. - Here we go. - Michael. Michael. - Okay. - Michael. - No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just- thank you for talking. Wish me luck. - No. What sort of movie would rudy have been If he had just stopped, given up, After two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, But that's not The point. - Kelly is disqualified! - What? You said the program is not open to caucasians. Well Anthropologically, she is indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of europe. Therefore, technically, she is caucasian. You're welcome, america. Yeah, but she's not white, though. Well, obviously, she is brownish. But, come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic. Darryl withdrew his application. He said the yale program Interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone. I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though. Kelly is the only applicant. Yeah, unless somebody else applies today. Namaste. Oh, dear god. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back. Hello. That's very nice. I never noticed that before. Sometimes my bangs cover it. Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh, May I ask you what that means? I do find that offensive, actually. We should have your contract done by Thursday. Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then. - Okay. - And, um You know, I just wanted to say it was really Really nice to do business with you. Yeah, it was nice to do business with you too. Thank you. Did IGet everything? I don't know. I think so. Yeah, I think so. okay. So--oh, donna? - Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't-- we don't validate. No, it's just in the lot, so - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. You'reWelcome. Mmm. Bye. Ahem. So, um Okay, if you have-- If there's any other questions that you have I don't have, uh, any other questions. I'm just gonna Make my way down to-- All right. Bye. Bye-bye! And have a good elevator ride. Okay. Oh, what's that out there? Michael, how did it go? How would one of you feel If I told you I could put you on a fast track To an executive position at this company? Holy cow. I'd be so happy. I wasn't talking to you, pale face. I know. I meant I'd be happy for them. What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train Straight to middle management. Dwight, I know these programs. "every color is important because, together, We make a rainbow." Yes. I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow. Mm! Speaking of rainbows, Oscar You are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at sabre could really benefit from your perspective. Dwight, we know kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is. I can protect you from kelly. Will you get out of here? Seriously. For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, Snake charming. Beds of nails, I like lying on them. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! This is hide tohsi hasagawa. He would like to apply for The sabre minority executive training program "print in all colors" initiative. Dwight, what are you doing? Helping heal america In a dramatic fashion In the 11th hour. God, I hate you so much! Caucasians, am I right? Have a seat. I'll translate. Why? I don't need translator. You don't know what you need. Just Why don't you tell me a little about yourself, hide. In japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand. Hey, michael. How you doing? I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore. You know what, michael? For what it's worth I was wrong too. I thought she was interested in you. She suckered you too. Mm-hmm. Was it the cleavage? Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts. - Yep. - Michael, you know, It's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It--it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far. You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, And thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff To bill my hmo. You know She's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused. Michael, I think donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days And then I can take it home? God. She left this here? - Yeah. Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work. What? All: No. Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off. It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened. - Michael - Well She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you. Yeah, I know. I know. - I'm sorry. - I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. Michael! Michael! Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette. Everyone, It is my pleasure to announce our newest member Of the sabre minority executive training program, Kelly rajanigandha kapoor. All right. They're going to be pretty pleased in tallahassee That I snagged an indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right. And the best part is is that I get a business stipend To buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes That I'm not gonna need anymore. Oh, my god, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much? - Oh. Actually, I was thinking about clothes That I was just gonna give to goodwill anyway. Great. Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. - Thank you, dwight. - Oh. I'll never forget everything that you've done for me. Gosh. Heh heh. Because I never forget anything. Just once, I would like to be a puppet master And have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask? You know what? Everybody told me That you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So There's your barrette. No, y-you wereRight. Who? You were right. About what? You were right. I'm sorry. No, no. No. - I'm sor-- - no.
- Stop it. - Stop what? You're talking about me in morse code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you. 'cause I know morse code. Ha! Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time And with our very limited budget, We went and got a nanny and then we nt out And took a class on a very outmoded And very unnecessary form of communication just so We could talk about you in front of you. Yup. That's exactly what we did. It all started when dwight was tapping his foot Against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight." Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. Detonator. Detonator where? Michael! Jim. Are you clicking a detonator? - It's a pen. - Michael, come on. Get back to work, dwight. Please. Fine. Hey. Tap away. Ooh! Things with donna are so-- Oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh We're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually andOrally And I am not used to relationships Going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job.  and I like it  Who enjoys the weekends? Of course. Now the weekend is always great If you have someone, which I do. I have donna. She is hot. She has a pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend Beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. And the reason you are here is that I need ideas For things that donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out. I have an idea for your weekend. Okay. Let me go back to my desk right now. Okay, you get out of here, big dog. Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas. Stanley got to go. Yeah, well, stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out. Walk around apple orchards. Super romantic. - Oh. That's fun. - Eel fishing. All right. Curl up with your favorite dvd. You and donna should hit the poconos. They have heart-shaped jacuzzis. Room enough for three. We actually went to the poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, We went to a little chinese bistro, Um, p.F. Chang's. Wait, why would go all the way to the poconos To p.F. Chang's when we have the great wall in scranton? Because when your super hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to mount pocono," You go to mount pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. Tmi. Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating? You know what, kelly? This is the real world. Not the real world: Scranton. Oh, my god, this is super weird. When ryan had two girlfriends, He used to take me to some diner in hazelton Just so the other girl wouldn't see. Some diner? It was the starlight diner. It's, it's in a life magazine spread About americana. You guys think donna's cheating on me? - No. Michael, no. - Are you nuts? You had a nice meal with your girlfriend In a lovely place-- - And--we had sex too. - That is right. Don't make any more of it. How? How what? How do I not make any more of it? You could start by concluding this meeting. All right. And she won't say, "I love you." Oh, no. How many dates have you been on? Nine dates. I said it on the second date. - Mm. - That seemsQuick. Even for lesbians. Does she keep her phone locked around you, michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, michael? Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower aftesex? Does she-- - yeah, she does all that. - Sorry, dude. - No, no-- Michael, do not let your imagination run amok. - Run what? - Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control. Why didn't you just say that, pam? Michael, do not let your imagination Run out of control. Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world. - You do? - Yes, jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship That is full of lies and deceit. But you didn't believe any of this was true Five minutes ago. That's what makes it so wrong. Ever since I found out That donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me. Oh, god, that tickles. What did-- I want someone to follow donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. I think I've got one for you. This is you. How much do you charge? $100 a day, plus expenses. I'll give you $50. Money's no object. Done. I'm just gonna warn you-- And I say this to all my clients-- You might not like what I find. Okay. And you might not like how I find it. Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, stanley. One of my clients just called and said that Their sabre printer started smoking And caught on fire. My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems. Hey, gabe, I need to talk to you about something. It's really important. There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right? Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job And the back of the printer started smoking And then the paper tray caught on fire. That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening.

Let me know what they say. Wow. That dude is good. What do you mean? You didn't feel like he was hiding something? I don't know. Like he was Covering something up? Maybe.

Donna, hi. All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out If donna is a cheater is to seduce her, Bring her to orgasm, then call michael And tell him the sad news. That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think? It's never too early for ice cream, jim.

Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update. - Michael, no-- - no, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that. It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is gonna spiral out of amok. Michael. Okay, I'm-- I'm going to talk straight to you Because I think you need to hear it. Michael. - God, this is so disgusting. Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you. I know. And you, you kind of torpedo Every romantic relationship you're in. That's not true. You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, carol, jan. Helene. Helene? - My mother. - Oh. My mother, helene. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. You should stop this, And you should call dwight right now. All right.

Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over. Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, But she's coming over here and she's furious. What? No, she didn't say that. You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, "what is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him." And this was after I have no other recourse But to tell her and gym security That you had sent me there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. I am not paying for that membership. Ohhh Mm Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office. No, I like the attention. is she here yet? Uh, no. Wait, yes. - That's her? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. Okay, I'll talk to you later. How could you think I would cheat on you? I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind. That's pathetic. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want. When I tell you I like you, You need to trust me, not some freak. If you wanna dump me, I totally get it. I told you I like you. Well, you are boner-ific.

What's up? I got your email. Close the door. Okay. I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz.  and-a don't mess with me  I'll figure something out. Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind gabe and I heard some things. Such as? It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, Uh, only thing I could make out clearly Was "andy," "problem, " "eliminate," something. I don't know what it meant. What? You don't know what it meant? How about, andy is a problem and we must eliminate him? Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that. Yeah. Hah. Hoo. Oh, hey, I love your earrings. Thank you. Did michael get them for you? No, I bought them myself. Where? Steamtown mall. Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earrings earrings earrings? Fancy girl? Platinum cat? Where? You know, I actually got them in philadelphia, In a mall down there. Franklin mills? King of prussia? Springfield? Governor's place? Uh, franklin mills. - What? - Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing. Okay, heart-shaped jewelry Is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, And it wasn't michael. Wait, so are you-- You like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right? No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love. Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this. So there I am, minding my own business, And darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by andy And go like this. Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less. So it turns out donna and I have A facebook friend of a friend in common So I was able to see some of her pictures online. This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. This photo was taken this morning. It's cece. She's never gonna do anything wrong. - Isn't that something? - Wow.

I lied, it's personal. It's about me and jim. We're-- I just--you're the only person I can talk to. - Jim is her husband. - Oh. - And-- - and they're having problems-- - No, not--we're not- - we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love- - good in bed. Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you About my sex life with jim. Oh, my god, look at how cheap street level rooms are.

I feel--I-- no, I'm not going to kill him. You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her. I have to hear it from her. You have to settle down first. I need to have her tell me herself. Right? Yes. - I need to have her say-- - yeah, but you have to calm-- I need to say, "what the hell is that? What the hell is that?" Look at this, look at this. Baby picture. No, god! No, no, oh, my god! Hi, michael, hi, michael. Okay. Okay. Okay. I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. We've investigated. Every time it's been user error. They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that.

My name is andrew baines bernard, And if you're watching this, it's because I've turned state's witness because I'm in danger Because I know too much. You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird. Higher? Okay. recently certain events Have come to my attention- higher. - Make it higher? Okay. - Mm-hmm. I have come to the conclusion That the sabre corporation-- One more, yeah. may be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger--ah! it's working. it's--I knew it. This-- We are blowing the roof off. Blowing the roof off! Nice. Nice. This is my partner, darryl philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing. I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, Go to church, Try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore. Who is he? - What, what do you mean? - The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it? It's you. I'm married. I'm the mistress?
Please don't throw these out. See them all over the office. Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, Like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. But I figured I'd rather live with ants Than with his creepy little disk. The second time I thought it was one of those, You know, the things you turn over, and it moos, Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, It was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time I did it out of spite. - Pfffttt! - Come on, michael. You're interrupting. You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent but deadly, And then you expect me Not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this? - Please sit down. You know, we're not gonna die of radon. We're gonna die of boredom. Yeah! Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets And I was in a room with hitler, bin laden, and toby, I would shoot toby twice. - No. - No! - That's not - Okay. You were being really funny, and then you went too far. I would kill bin laden and then toby. - No, that's still - Mm-mm. Okay, geniuses, how would you do it? Curve the bullet Like in my favorite james mcavoy film, wanted. All that does is help you shoot around things. Is there a curtain rod in the room? - I don't know. - How about make believe land Has anything you want? Stanley, please. This is serious! Is this the thing where they use an icicle So there's no evidence? Yes. We stab toby through the heart with an icicle. Come on. The whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it. You line them all up, you take one bullet, Shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. Phyllis, you're hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're toby. Andy, you're bin laden. Line up. I don't wanna do this. Throats together. toby, just do it! - Toby, come on. - God! Ready? One bullet. AndBoom! Puuuhhh! Puuuhh! - Yeah, that works. - That works. Good work. What flavors did you get? It's so exciting, pam. The eagles are doing a theme of ice creams In honor of turning 60. "despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla." Why do they do this? Do you want me to go back to the store? No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up. This is all for michael. Turns out his girlfriend was married. Yeah. And when michael gets a broken heart, This whole place comes to a halt, So we're just trying to get out in front of this. After his last breakup, He ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, pam? That's what pam told me. Yeah. Or no--well-- I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with cece, Otherwise I'd be running this. That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though. We have mr. Bean playing in the conference room And the pink panther movie in his office With half-hour shifts to watch with him. And we need bodies in both these rooms, people, So please sign up. - He's coming. - Oh. Okay. Everyone, remember, when he gets like this, He will wallow if you empathize. Keep conversations light And if you get stuck and you don't know what to do, Make a random sound effect, okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay. - Hey, everyone. - No, toby! - No! Out! - Get out right now! - Leave now. - Leave. Get outta here. - Please! - Right now. Oh, and if he makes a joke, Just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay? Morning, everyone. Hey! - Hey! - Hey. Hello. - Michael. Nice tie or something. Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. - That's hilarious. - That's awesome. You want some ice cream? Oh--oh, wow! Are those eagles' flavors? Cake it to the limit. That's my favorite. I love that. Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share? Boi-oi-oi-oing! Okay. WellThat's random. I will dig into those later. I don't follow this exactly. Uh, "the descendants of any replicants from this union Shall have"-- Joint custody. Are we talking about your grandchildren? - No. - No. Rather than spend all day in court, We've decided to settle our dispute Using a mediator. It was an option spelled out In our child-rearing contract and - Alleged contract. - Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over. Pff. Yeah, just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. - Oh, yeah-- - gaah! See? Don't even need to make contact. The law will do it. So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "b"-- uh, the beet juice cleanse. I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting! How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample. Dwight, look at my teeth. Eh. No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there. Could he still be seeing her? I don't think he'd do that. So we're gonna say the most likely scenario Is that michael matured overnight? Well, it happened to tom hanks in big. Exactly. It happened in big. No, I gotta go. Text me later. I'm really too tired to do this. - Me too! - Then let's just not do this! Do you have any idea the risks involved? - Hey, michael. - Hey. We were wondering if you'd like to have Dinner with us tonight in our home And play with our baby. We could order in from hooters. Oh, hooters to go. Nice. We can watch a movie. And play rock band. - Billy joel rock band. - ThatExists? Yes. Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, But thanks for the offer. Michael scott, are you still seeing donna? Okay, pam She's not invisible, so stop asking silly questions. Oh, michael. Since when is this an office Where we delve into each other's personal lives? I like donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband Or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong. That is something I would never do. Well, I think we all know What you're capable of, meredith. Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, Or been used to cheat with. I askEveryone in the room, "are you in a relationship?" People, this is scranton, And many people consider that to be The paris of northeastern pennsylvania. And in paris, It is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers. Uhh! Ryan, I do not want you Hanging out with michael anymore. Okay. Okay, I will have you know that I asked donna about this, And she is fine with it, And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer. - How does he feel about it? He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. It was right under his nose. I had to tell him! Now you're just being hurtful. I'm sorry, it-- why is it okay For stanley to cheat or for phyllis to cheat - Hey-- - onHer diet? He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting, drugs. They spit. Did donna tell you that? Real sports with bryant gumbel. So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy. You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring michael jackson. Just sit there and think about michael jackson. My name is andy bernard, and I'm a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with william shakespeare, A cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I would so much rather Play the part on stage. SoHere's the thing about infidelity. Mm, no, no. When are you people going to stop casting The first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy. How does that work? Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off And having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him. In any cheating movie, The person getting cheated on is the hero. You're ali larter. I'm beyonce. I am beyonce always. - Not this time. - Yes, I am. This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, See what a horrible person he is. - I would love that. - Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out. I have work to do. Oh, really? I thought you were the boss. Let's go. I can't wait to see this jerk Who is making me cheat on his wife. Should punch him in the nose For what he's making me do to her.  bum bum bum bum   bum bum bum bum   bum bum bum bum  - all right, andy, please. - Baseball! - Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him. - Where? - Right there. The coach! Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees! Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? See? The grownup by the base? and now, coaching third base With two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain. All right. Can you just-- Can you just act normal for a second, please? Whatever. I'm the one blending in. Guys? - Pam. - Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, gabe. Can you two please join me in my office? Now. You were supposed to be the lookout. Yeah. Well, it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag. I don't wanna be the heavy here, But honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad. - Sorry about that. - So embarrassing. Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, The power dynamics. Well, you were surprisingly restrained. We will be well-rested tomorrow. Okay. That's great, actually, Because I wanted to talk to you about something else. Excellent. Go for it. I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. Anyway, the question is, What is the best way To disseminate important information in an efficient way? Right? So, uh, let's, uh Finally there's a provision here In the occurrence that the child is born an old man, A la benjamin button. - Same page. - Same page. Go to the next one. Just keep moving. Despite the provision covering Whether this is all part of the matrix-- Which we can't know. - This is essentially - Unless we're unplugged. Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor. And wake up in the future. Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract. What? Look, I can't enforce That anybody have a child with anyone else. - What? - So essentially, This comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000. What? I don't have $30, I have it buried very deeply, And I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it. Chase dixon is up. Could be a big play. You have no idea what you're talking about. I know it's like cricket. - You don't. No, no. - And it's--there's-- Well, home plate is like a wicket. - You don't know. You don't- - you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "hey, donna, why don't you wash the dishes? "high-five, donna. "hey, why don't you bring me my slippers? High-five. I'm taking all the credit." Seems pretty well liked by the team. Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary. You do know that high school coaches Don't pay their players. I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it- that was a euphemism. $30,000? There's gotta be another way. He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune. Look, I will not pay. Well, I have an alternative. "intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion"? Look, I don't think that's actually legal. Agreed. Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses. But not in your bed. It's lumpy. Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, And those names are ember, milky way, diane, and lumpy. Fine. Five times. Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution. - I want eye contact. - No. - Yes. - Do you understand How rare that is in nature? I'm not some farm animal. Great game, coach. Shh! Okay, all right. Don't--don't-- You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys. Ha. The other guys can go die. - okay. - Baseball! Go talk to him. - No. God. You go talk to him. - Let's go. - Shane. Great game, man. Do I know you? No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us. Are somebody'sParents? Oh, are you guys Kenny's dads? Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. - Okay. - But I have a wife, actually, Who I really love a lot. - Okay. Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage. Whoa! I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, Getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person. Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to Focus here on the game. I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me Enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife. Of course. Okay? I gotta Get back to this. - Of course. - All right. But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon! - No, no, no. - Come on, get over here. - I'm good. Oh, my god. - Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach. Sorry. I got some stomach cramps. It's all right, all right, just keep it going! Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin' bond. Okay, orange slices. There ya go. - Thanks, michael. Don't thank me. Thank dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo! Why would you throw something wet at me? You love it. There ya go. Now, were those for the team? Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal hawks. - Ah. - I don't think those Were yours to take. Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from coach shane. I just wanna go on record as saying That I do not condone this affair, And I even went so far As to force michael to confront the victim of his behavior. - Did you talk to him? - I did. You talked to the man Whose wife you're having an affair with. - Wow. That is crazy. - Was there a fistfight? No. We just talked. He's very nice. And it didn't change your mind. - It did not. - Michael, that's awful. - Isn't it? - Yes. - I'm awful, aren't I? - Yeah. That's pretty bad. I'm an awful guy! Ooh! How can you live with yourself? I am what I am, oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for. That is a dangerous game, friendo. Well, because I thought that it was a book About anthropology the store. I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore. 'cause it's next to the baby section, okay? All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning When you said, " I read a book about anthropology." I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now. - I'm not scream- - I'm not screaming. That's meredith's cake. It's her birthday. I don't care. I have an appetite for life! Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's lemon. Good for you, man. Good for you. He takes what he wants. You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you. What about kelly? You read my mind. is this a joke? Yep. It's hard to live that way, man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, michael, I-I-I can't be that cold. You'll learn, baby. You'll learn. I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, But they're no match for a grown schrute man. let's see what she gets. aah! Uh, boss, we're out of paper. - Yeah, I noticed that. - Are you gonna add any more? Nope. He don't give an "f" about nothin'! I have got big balls. I don't think I'm gonna make it. what about an energy drink or something? It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, cece drinks it six hours later. Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it. Well, it does and it doesn't. Probably shouldn't tell you this, But a lotta guys in the warehouse Work multiple jobs, so We have a place. - A place? - A restful location. Talk to glen. He'll take you up in the lift. You sleep in the warehouse? Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator Keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it When I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, It doesn't exist, okay? - Okay. - Pam. Okay. - For your signature. - Okay. Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. Phyllis, look at-- Okay, that's All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, It will not. I am going to leave right now And go to a motel to meet donna. Why not your condo? Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into Isn't very condo-appropriate. Oh, michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, And no one's changing their mind. Okay, morgan freeman-narrating-everything. Do you want someone to stop you? 'cause no one's going to. Nobody better try to stop me. Good. I could have stopped him. - Are you warmed up? - No. God, angela, why is that always my responsibility? What did you do to yourself? Never mind. Just never mind. - Well, it better work. - Oh, it'll work. Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract. How do I feel about breaking up with donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now Because I know that I absolutely Made the right decision. At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself OrBeing happy. And I picked The Former. - Michael scott? - Yes? Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors? um I have done some very bad things,
Michael Scott, as seen on TV. I saw you on the news, And I want to pinch your tiny wiener. It's packer! - Oh! Pack-man, I thought you were a girl. Apparently, there are allegations That sabre printer can cause a fire So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, "what? All right." So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today, and it's online. And then I call froggy 98. And I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough. Everybody, we are at defcon 5. I am officially the second most watched clip of the day On the wbre news site. What's number one? Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused Of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again. I would like you all to go to the website And watch my clip 11 times. So instead of working, you want-- - Yes. Yes. - Okay. Come on. Get it up. That's what-- Let's do it. Did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site. Aw, it's kissing its mommy. Michael, you have to see this. It's like the cutest thing ever. Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as "who cares?" It's not even that interesting, a baby otter. It can't even stand up. It's trying to stand up. There it goes. The Office - 6x25 "Whistleblower" Aired on may 20, 2010 Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Jo, we were not expecting you. Y'all, no doubt, know why I'm here. No. Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap, foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually, the--the real story Isn't quite as racy. But, uh Let's give it a go. Jo, I think that I know what happened. I'm not sure you do, Teddy bear. Well, now I think I might not. Not long ago, we discovered a defect In one of our printers. So we got a software patch and fixed it right up, Just like that. I don't know how it works. Just as we were about to send out a letter To our affected customers, Giving 'em free toner, And we keep 'em happy, But somebody here, they liked that first story better-- The one where we lose half our clients For no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, Just come forward, please. Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office. - Can you, now? - Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand. Put your hand up, Norma Rae. If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses And stick 'em in your eye sockets. So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers Killed baby seals, I would not be a whistle-blower. The bernards, for generations, Have silenced whistle-blowers. That's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. ? old Mr. Bernard ? ? old Mr. Bernard ? ? who have you silenced today? ? This is a little form, says, "I did not do it." There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, Because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are. I know what their favorite kind of cake is. I know what color streamers they like. All that's just birthday information, Michael. Yes, yes. But it shows a bigger picture. Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho. What you say? - Okay. When mama was working as a prison guard And something went missing, she'd ask one question-- What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, "come down on 'em With that swift hammer of justice" Innocent. A clear conscience don't need no mercy. But if they said, "officer Bessie, well, They may have had a reason, blah, blah, blah, blah" Well, nine times out of ten, that's the anus they checked. So say we catch this whistle-blower, What do you think I should do with 'em? We should give 'em a one-way ticket To Montego Bay Where they keep all the Al-Qaeda. Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay. Yes. You put 'em in jail for a long time. You put 'em in jail for as long as you can. Well, I guess we're all right, Michael. I want these people to really pay. I want 'em to suffer. - Mm-hmm. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right. - Yeah. - Okay. - Hey, Dwight. - Hey, I.T. Guy. You mind if I get in there for a second? Oh, sure thing. Go ahead. Wha--unh! Dwight, what the hell? - Apache persuasion hold- - that's the hell. What are you doing to my computer? The lawyers are searching our hard drives For information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother. You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide. Wait, are they searching all our computers? Yeah. I already got to yours, Kev. No, that's cool. Some-- sometimes I run. I'm a runner. Everybody knows it was Andy. And it is not fair for us all to take the fall For his big, stupid mouth. That's ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm gonna believe one of his "spermed" lovers. Look, he's been complaining about this for a while. It's not crazy. Ugh. - Okay, Dwight. - Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, But I have a list right here. You should fire the following people. Well, I'm inclined to believe you. Why would I disparage a company That has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams? Yeah, I noticed you've has a great year. Good boy. - You turning that money into more money? are you referring to alchemy? I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, But if you ain't investing in property, Then you're dumber than a dummy. I'm not dumb. I'm smart. Well, buy property. That's my advice. Is there something that you would like to say to me - Uh - About talking to the press? - I didn't do that! Okay? - Mm-hmm. I-I Didn't do it. I don't believe you. I swear on the graves of my parents, Who aren't even dead yet. That's a little much. All right. All right. All right. I don't care. That's how much I swear. Okay, I believe you. I believe you. How come no one's giving Darryl any crap? He was more bothered about it than me. Did you tell anyone outside of this office That the printers were catching on fire? Yeah, I did. I-I was talking to this girl at a bar. Oh, no, no, no I think she could sense my sadness. I didn't find out till later she-- She was a copy editor at the trib. Oh, my God. Was she cute? - No. Oh, God, Darryl! I basically swore up and down That none of my employees did it. And then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably gonna get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is. Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was. I was. We didn't find anything on your computer. Good. Except this. Oh, this is, uh, just a mystery novel That I've been working on. I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious-- Why would a man who hates people Want to have a relationship with a maid? Oh, uh, I don't know. They way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, Or he wants to use her services To mop up after a murder. Oh, yes. Write your own damn novel. It was me. What was you? You were the leak? Okay, I'm talking to this woman at day care Uh-huh. She's telling me all about her amazing trip to Vietnam. I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire spontaneously. - Why'd you do that? - Her husband's a reporter. Yeah. So now everyone hates Andy, And it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do. Okay, just relax. Just need to relax. I could tell Jo, or I could tell Michael. This is a very good idea. This is good--let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush 'em out. You leaked it? I don't know what to do. Do I go tell Jo or I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person. I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh, God. My mind is going a mile an hour. - That fast? - Ohh Two whistle-blowers! Two. I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired For something I said. Yeah? I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me. So I'll see you in Meredith's van in five minutes. Yeah, you didn't need to actually say-- I have never seen so many parking tickets. All right, this is just messed up. No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in hee-yah Is what's messed up. We need to brainstorm. We need to get out of this. Brain hurricane-- come on, think. What do we got? - Um Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late. - We're not going for yogurt. - It's okay. She's cool. She also whistle-blew. Guys, I couldn't help it. It is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue. Hey, hey! It's as interesting as a morgue. Of course I'm the leak. I think I tweeted it. I can't control what I say to people. I spend the whole day talking. I mean, I video chat, I skype, I text, I tweet, I phone, I woof. "woof" is a site that I'm launching To be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals So you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But look, why tell you When I can show you? I just sent myself a woof. Ryan, you have a woof on line one. Thank you, Erin. Woof! Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence- no evidence, no case. Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers? No--okay, not all the computers, Just our computers. That idea sucks. I don't think that's a good idea. Just don't say no! Mike, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat. Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl. That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just- nobody's going to prison. Okay? Um All right, Michael, You need to convince Jo to go easy on us, And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe. Okay. You can count on me. Let me give you a hand. Ready? oh, shoot. You got it? - Got it? No, no. Dwight schrute. The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office. Basement office? You mean like a lair? hey, Jo. Michael. I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch Thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know that I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em. And we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And--and we pay 'em, But we make 'em feel like They did something really wrong. The one question I have is, Do we give 'em a Christmas bonus? I say Yes. It's Christmas. But right after, they're back in the thick of it. Michael Scott What do you know? What? it doesn't matter what I know. If it doesn't matter, then tell me. - Why? - Because I want to deal with it The way I deal with it. Well, deal with this. Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, And now I got a branch manager Who's giving me the silent treatment. Speak to me. Speak. Come with me. - What? Are you leaving? Should I continue with the investigation? Are you gonna kill me? I just need you to come by later And sign a few forms. - Okay. What time works for you? Mr. Schrute, what time works? Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at 1725 slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, lowball 'em. Don't call me till you have it. But-- Are we going someplace far away? I know you said no questions, but I have an early dinner that I need to get to With the chief of police. I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you. All right, uh Stan, you're up. It wasn't me. What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. - And? - You did it. What? Based on what? Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now And sit with it, see how it feels? - All right. Sounds good. - Okay. Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy. Yeah, you know? I mean, for all we know, it could have been Jim. Really? - Michael - I have rights. Let's just talk. I'm not gonna tell you anything. Honey, you don't seem like your normal self. Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch. Mama Jo knew there was something up. The whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down. Oh, I hate that. And my new favorite restaurant sucks. I bought a video camera last year, And I was looking at the tapes, And there were only, like, 12 minutes That I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? And I miss Holly. Who's Holly? Holly flax, from the Nashua branch Best h.R. Rep That Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My blockbuster stock is down. I think that the real question is, Who is the whistle-blower? Oh, Jesus. I may have heard from an old client, And I may have immediately started spreading the news To other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about " suck it." Suck it-- Gabe, I told you all about the printers. I mean, it could be you, Gabe. That man has a point. Yes, it's totally obvious. I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. It's Angela. Get her, boys. Hey, guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say good-bye to everyone. Through "teach for America," I'm gonna go down to Detroit and teach, uh, Inner-city kids about computers. Uh, not now. Oh, yeah, it's just my friends are out in the car waiting, So I thought I would Phyllis, what's this guy's name again? I don't know. Is it "shadow" or "Garth"? It's something weird. I-- My name is Nick! Okay, well, "nick, " we're in a meeting. Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame I.T. Guy, and everybody hates me. Hey, listen, man, you can't take it personally. You called me "man"? I just said my name just now. Did you forget it already? No Sport. you guys have 15 parties a week. You can't learn my name? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, I.T. Guy, here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, sadiq, because he kept to himself. And we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what? I'm gonna leave you with one other thought. Inner-city kids use computers For two things-- games and porn. So good luck wasting your life Lurch. - Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, And guess what- you're not a photographer. And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right, and, you, this guy-- You're the one who told the press. You wrote an email to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a quicktime movie Of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch. He's the snitch. So that's it. Check it out. We're gonna believe that guy? When I was growing up, there was nothing better Than being a big ol' business tycoon. Mm. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling. I'd be a hero to all those little girls out there And they'd make a Barbie out of me. Hmm. I hate that I sell cheap printers. I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press And make one of them public-apology recalls, I mean That's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie. You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, To do that for you. Oh, honey, surely you don't want that. I-I surely do. And don't call me honey. Airplane ii. I'm about to buy this building, you know. You don't say. I own a 1/8 share on a rental property Down in Pittston. Well, I'm 1/8 proud of you. Enjoy that chair for now Because pretty soon you will be on your feet, Like Buckingham Palace. Hey, Phyllis, have you seen my bag? Mm. You deserve it. Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down And children to die. Does that make me a hero? No, it does not! Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world either. It does! - Andy? - Hey. I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you To go to the press. Uh Thanks. Yeah, you know It just seemed like the right thing to do. Yeah. "we at sabre have betrayed the trust "that we have built with our customers. "we regret our slow response "and our lapse in candor and judgment. "at this time, we are issuing a full recall "of all sabre gh400 printers. "we will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions." Are there any questions?

We did it! Yes! - I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus. Lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the Lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, Which hurt. That got infected, even though I peed on it. - Saw inception. Or at least I dreamt I did. - Broccoli Rob, obviously, Will be there. - Yes, of course. - And j.C. We call him Blorville Because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher. - Who's the guy who invented the peanut? - Hey, guys. - Hey! - Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. - Not at all. - I'm gonna head back To Siberia there. - Aw. - Ciao. I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite. - Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date If I didn't have to. ButIt's been great. - Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend Over the summer? No. I've been through anger management, okay? So right now I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, Gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe. - Hey. What are you doing? - From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack. - Well, what if you're cold? - Pbbbt! Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions. I'm too busy. - Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, But we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks Instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear. - Jim, you have one job to do, And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration. Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer. Bed and breakfast proprietor. Aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list. - This summer I did the minority Executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, "Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?" And I'd be, like, "blah blah blah, Blah blah blah blah blah blah," Giving you the exact right answer. - Coffee monkey's arrived. - The coffee was supposed to be here at 9:00. - Here you go, big "o." Tiny Darryl Hannah. - It says "decaf." you get me decaf? - Ooh, yeah. Must have been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, Or should I drive all the way back? - Well, summer, I, um, Blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're gonna get out of Afghanistan. - The new guy sucks. Calls me "the nard man." I'm the "nard dog," okay? Nard man is my father. - My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are citizen Kane And the boondock saints. - That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael. - He's not the worst. Okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy remember? Eehhhhh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. Mm aw, it's not cappuccino. - He messed yours up to. - He's got to go, Mike. - It's just coffee, guys. But yeah, I'll look into it, okay? - Wow, that's a lot of keys. - The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man. - That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. - Where? - I think they run through these panels And then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure 'cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. - Gimme that. - Yep. Wait. And this. - Yes. - Go get 'em. What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been The busiest summer of my life. - Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha, very nice. Give me my keys. NotFunnyJim! - Sorry. - Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I'm just gonna put a couple keys on every day Until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was A little gift to me, but - It was really funny. - Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert. - I love you. - Luke Luke! - What's up, Venus? - Did you send those samples to Justin At Lehigh motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em. - Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe. - Hey Turn off the chumbawamba and scram, twerp. - You don't have to yell. - Okay, rude. Luke I want you to go to the supermarket for me. - What for? - To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great. And another thing I did this summer. I hired my nephew. - Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me. Because his mother, Who also happens to be my half sister Kind of cut me off from that side of the family The last time I saw Luke Was the opening day of ace Ventura II, And that was '95. So, yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest. Don't bother Luke. - Why is there a circle with a line through it? - That means don't. Haven't you seen ghostbusters, Pam? - Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke. - No, it Yes, okay. Right. All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. - Don't don't bother Luke. Got it. Come on. Okay. Um That's as clear as I can make it. - Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it. - Because I don't want it getting back to sabre That we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. - Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe? - That'd be hilarious. Uh, "Joe, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em." - Nope, it won't be Gabe, But actually, there is somebody in the office Who is very, very close to Luke. - How close? - Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you? - Yes. Of course. - Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related. - No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes, he is. He's my nephew. - What? - Ohh! - Luke is my nephew. - Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment Because he's your nephew. - Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing. - What's wrong with a level playing field? - Do think they should have had open auditions For the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid And a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe. - Oh, man, so many points being made. - I couldn't care less about nepotism. But I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat. - God, when he needed help on earth, Who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son. - That's a really tight argument. - Thank you. - Yeah. - But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus. - No! No. I'm just saying, why does God Get to do something that I don't? - This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke, who happens to be terrible. - Well, then, why aren't you bugging me To fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me And bad at what he does! - I would just like to say something Off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So thank you. - If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, Why have you been keeping it a secret? - Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them right? No. But you ruined it. SoThank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him Like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is! - Hey! Ice cream afternoon! - Whoo Whoo Whoo! - Whoo! - Wait Soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream? - Or enough for everyone? - No, man. There was no list. UhBut I got bagel chips. - Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips. - Clutch cream run, bro. - Get whatever you want. On me. - You really think you can make it up to me with food? - I don't know. That usually works. I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, So he's become a monster. I need to make this right. - I came down here to feed the feral cats Like I usually do, And I found something unsavory In the back of your nephew's car. - Okay, you know what? Just just back off. Back off! - Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them. - All right, those might be his. He might own an ebay store. - Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him Where he was like, "I don't own an ebay store." So - Okay, okay. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair witch hunt project. - Oh, sure, those are the expense reports That corporate was waiting for yesterday. - Let's just make this kid open this damn car. - Oh, my gosh, those are the pants He wanted to return to talbots. - I'm reconsidering sending him back anyway. - You get that kid to open this car, Or I'm gonna do it myself by calling AAA. - Wait a minute. - I'm in! - Don't all right. Well, okay. You've just committed a felony. - Yep, here they are. - Yep, I just lost a client 'cause I swore I sent these samples on time. - This kid's costing us sales, Michael. - I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see - No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit. - Why is this my problem, Michael? - Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy To just hide it from you. - Those overnight packages needed to go out, And Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable. - Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Okay, now educate me why you won't fire the boy. - You don't have all the facts. - Which are? - I love him. - Oh, God. How far has it gone? - No. No. He's my nephew. - Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? 'cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool, but he can't come in my house. - Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work In my pool. - If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? - Mm-hmm. - Cover his ass like tidy whities. - I will cover his ass like moss on Mississippi tree stump. - Was how I put it on clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys. - Luke and I have been working side by side As master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally, he'll need a little push. And I will do that, and he'll slow down, And then I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids. You have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, But mostly it's about pushing each other. - Oh, yeah. This will be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff. - Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "door closed," The doors open. Or he presses "lobby," it goes to third floor. Stuff like that. Can you do that? - Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board. - Dwight is about to get so pammed. - Hey, did you sms text message me? - Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Uh, come on. - Okay, that's weird. - Hmm. - Just hitting "door closed." what? - There we go. - Well - Uh - is this elevator going up? - Mm-hmm. - HeyThe elevator is disobeying us! Ohh-Kay. Okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. - Um - Hank! Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol. - Oh - Just calm down. - Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately. - I don't - use your talons! Pry 'em open! Okay, DWI oh, my God! - Well, don't look, freak! - Dwight, what are you doing?! - Well - We've only been in here for, like, two seconds! - I got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner. - You've gotta be kidding me. - Luke, is going to use his laser pointer To point to account setup. You click on that first, Then a whole new not no, no, no. Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. - Tsh. - All right. Luke, come on. Stop it. - What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said. - Give me the pointer. - So you just want me to move it. You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it. - No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously. - All right, fine, fine. I'll just go. - Okay. - I'm gone. - All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup. - Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? - Yes. - I think he's burning my eye. - Michael, do something. - Sack up, man. - Okay, can I have that? - No. - Okay, I am going to count down from five. Five Four. - I'm not kidding. Three. Two. One. - Give okay. - All right, give it up. - No! YouAre going to learn to be more professional, Luke! - What the - That's what you're going to do, Luke! - Aah! What the hell was that? - I had to do that. - Hey, fuck this! Screw it! - All right. Are we good? - You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought On capital punishment. - That was awesome. - Texas justice. - Yeah, your nephew is so lame. - He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean. - You follow him on Twitter? - Everywhere I look, it's Betty white this And Betty white that. Finally, a kid who's not talking about Betty white. Of course I follow him. - Michael You just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private? Yes, of course. What is this in reference to? - Pam? - Oh, hey, Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight. - I did not do this. - I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video. - This is impressive. - Well, you know They don't call me The Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing. - Do they call you that? - They do call me that. - Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down. - Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor. - Oh! Course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight? - Yeah. - Great. - How ya doin'? - Pretty good. You must be almost out of water. - Stop drinking the water! Stop! - Yeah. - Oh! - You - No, no, no, no. It's the other hand, right hand. - Right hand? - Yeah. - Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice If Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, All across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, They make it work. And my hat's off to them. - Argh! - Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. - You - hey - Dwight - Dwight - Stop! - Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit Is to call this a stress-induced outburst. - You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling. - That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery. Good. Well, thats the spirit. I can do that. And you will do your counseling right here because Okay. Wait, what? Yeah, I'm really looking forward to work with you, Michael. Is there another option? Don't try to do this termination. Michael?
Late every day this week. We signed Ceecee for the staycare, it's on the other side of town. The traffic - Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center Opening right here in this building? Is there really? Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center? Well, I guess it's not an evil idea, It's just a regular idea, but there's no Good laugh for a regular idea. Welcome to the sesame Avenue daycare center For infants and toddlers. You remember my cousin Mose? Welcome, children. - Were you painting in the dark? - Wait, is this your place, Dwight? - Oh, no, no, I like to think of it as the kids' place. Would you like a tour? - I don't think we really need Oh, let's take the tour, Pam. - Yeah. - Come on. Here is the language skills And cognitive development area. These are English, uh, letters. I see you found our magical toy box, Jim. - These are actually forks and knives from the break room. - Jim, to you and me, maybe. But, come on. To a child's imagination that's mister fork, And lieutenant knife, and miss fork. And a soy sauce packet. That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed. Don't beat yourself up. - We come fully equipped with a restroom, Feeding trough, play bucket, And room for a plant, in success. - Who will be watching the children? - No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. Prove it. - WhatNo. - We're gonna head outside. Just give it a whirl. I just wanna see how it works. - Oh, no, no, no I - but I'll tell you this. If this works out, I think we're looking real good. - I promise you, that door locks. - What's something you did that This is the worst! You are the worst. I hate looking at your face. I wanna smash it! Okay, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over, it's done. But, my punishment is, um, Worse than hell. - Michael's been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling With a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people Would just ask a few standard questions And tick off a few boxes, But I've got a chance to do some good here. I know what you wanna ask me. "did your mom ever see you naked?" - We can do this with more privacy. So you can molest me? Oh, okay. I don't think so. We're gonna leave the blinds open, So everybody can see What a big failure you are. That's the key. Boycott the steamtown mall! Everyone, you heard me. Cancel all your business with the steamtown mall! - The mall itself, or the stores in the mall? All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks. America's one big mall. Did something happen, Dwight? - Yeah, something happened. Oh, yeah. Something happened, Jim. Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it might help to get some context So we can get on board. You don't wanna know. - I'd like you to imagine a place Where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop To my car, after I drop My daughter off on Sunday afternoons. - I I'm glad Michael's getting help. He has a lot of issues, and he's stupid. Look, I'm not gonna tell you That we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Okay, well, let me know if anything changes. Pam? I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene or whatever it is. Tell me everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Tell me I'm good at sales. - You're good you're good at sales. - The unfair thing about working in sales Is that your salary is almost all commission. So if you suck at sales, You make almost no money. I guess that's fair. - Dwight. - What? - Did you call all my clients at the mall And cancel all my business While using the "f" word? Yes, I did. And I'm gonna do the same with all of your clients. No, you will not. - Oh, yes, I will. That mall is corrupt. Okay, they're appearancist! - Okay, Dwight, we can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened? - Yeah. What happened, Dwight? Okay? - You guys know me, you know that I'm Not one for fancy things. But there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store, And it caught the corner of my eye When I took Mose down to the mall To get his blood pressure at the rite aid. And I thought, you know, Maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall. So what happened? - I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, And they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, And they started taking pictures of me With their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough For precious heirlooms. You know what, Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to Pretty woman their asses. We should start our own mall. Yeah! Wait, wait, wait. Actually, that's a really good idea, Kelly. What did I say? I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out. Dwight, how about this? Instead of a boycott, You and I, together, go down to that store And we teach those snobs a lesson. No, you and IAnd I. I'm gonna come with you. - Okay. - Good. All right. - Did you assume that I would automatically side With the rich, snobby shop owner? How about now? How about now? How about now? How about now? - Uh, what's your favorite flavor of - One hour. - What? - One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up. Okay, keep it moving. I wanna do all six hours today. - Okay, I can't count the hour if you don't talk. No, no, noNo. I know my rights, all I had to do Is sit here for six hours. Do my time. - Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, And I can't do that unless I honestly - Do you have any idea how angry that is making me? Tell me. I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere. - Yes, I will. I will talk all right. Be careful what you wish for, Toby. Apparently theres a famous Hollywood movie From the 1980s beautiful girl. Pretty woman. - Um, apparently - Pretty woman. - It's one of the best revenge stories of all time, In which this sex worker, who is the protagonist That can't be right. Andy, how does it - no, no, no. - What? - I wanna hear you tell it. - Okay, um, the sex worker is denied service At a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns, dressed in all the trappings Of extravagant wealth, but instead of shopping - Julia Roberts goes in the store, and she's like, "I was in here yesterday, and you people wouldn't help me." And the shopgirl goes, "oh." And then Julia Roberts goes, "you girls work on commission, right?" And the girl's like, "yeah." And Julia Roberts goes "big mistake. Huge." - I was telling I was telling that. - How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Okay, sure. - Who can I speak to in this office About saving on window treatments? I don't know. - Is one of you the office administrator? I. I'm the office administrator! Can I show you a few samples? Uh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all. There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work. - Toby, can I really tell you anything? Of course. Well, the other night, When I was sitting at the table, Eating my penis I mean peas. That was weird. - All right. - That's weird. I think it all stems From the fact that I was I was probed. By an alien life force. An a.L.F. Alf. You know, I might have actually Been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet, You never see the lower half, But there's a lower half. Office administrator. So when did this happen? A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate. - Mm-hmm. - Who isn't there anymore. And I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that? - TypicalYeah, totally. Well, congrats. Thanks, yeah. So I'm I'm just gonna take care of stuff around the office And get paid a reasonable salary. We need that, right? - Totally, that's great. - I get paid $40,000 a year. - Great. - Maybe $50,000. - $50,000! No, not $50,000. $41,000, I think. - $41,000. - $41,500. That's great. - Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides, turn around. Now, today we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman. - A gentleman, who is a rich snob. Who will go into shopping malls And drop huge amounts of cash on clothes. - Is he still doing his boycott? - No, no, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah. - Your shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo. - Agreed. - Really? - Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. - Wait, less matching to appear more rich? The glasses are a little I liked them. - I thought they were kind of cute. - Yeah, I liked them too. - I can't see. - Say stuff like, "good morning, good afternoon." People appreciate that. - Wait, I see you every day. Can I say, "good month?" - I'm telling you how to do this, man. - If someone offers you a cocktail, Accept, but keep your wits about you. Okay. - Please and thank you go a long way. - Copy. Thank you. Thank you. Please. I think he's got it. And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? - Come on, Michael. These are all fake stories. - Yes, yes, they are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind Would come up with weird stories like that? Three hours, we're halfway done. How? Hey, do you have a second? - Yeah. - Well, as I'm sure you know, For the past few months, I've been the office administrator, Since right before you guys took over. Right, of course. And I haven't goen paid yet. I'm not blaming you. Thank you so much. - I just think somebody lost the paperwork. Oh, boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this, So I can back this up to corporate? Yes, absolutely, right away. You know what, Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, In case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock By playing games, drawing some pictures, talking? - We present to you, for your final comments And approval, Dwight k. Schrute. Go get 'em, Dwight. Wish us luck. Thank you. Dwight. Ooh, all done. Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful And you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important event that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today. - We could play something more complicated if you'd like. This is plenty complicated. So you've played it before? - I played it once or twice with Jeff. Who's Jeff? - Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, Who she married. - So her husband and your stepdad. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I never thought of it that way, though. - Did you guys do much stuff together? Yeah, you know what, He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird, though; They took the pitcher Out of the game, and I felt really bad Because the pitcher wasn't going to be able to play With his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move By taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager. It's working. I'm doing it. Ahem. - What? - My place, tonight. Wear this. - Do you have your card? Yes. Don't forget the pipe. - It's really sad that your dog ran away, But why did it keep you from going to the park? I was afraid I would find him In the park playing with another kid. Why? - I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place To find a kid he liked better. - Dogs don't do that. - Right? Why would a dog do that? - I don't know. - When I hear myself say it, it just sounds ridiculous. But I never said it out loud, so It's very important for you To be liked, isn't it? Well, let's not get too This isn't a counseling session. Okay. You son of a gun. You son of a bitch. Wow, okay. - I'm just trying to help you, Michael. - You bitch, God! - Michael. - You're very helpful, aren't you? - I'm trying to - you try to help everybody. Do you wanna play another game? - I just wanna - you are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. - Hey. - Lose, you lose. I don't need your help, Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I gonna make you cry? - Just fill them out any way you want. Okay. - Have Erin fax them back to corporate. Will do. - Okay, filled outGood. Thank you, doctor, take two of these And call me in the morning. Hey, Michael? Um, about three months ago, I was talking There are a lot of one-person departments here, So there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man, if I can pull this off, It will be the scam of all scams. And yet, very helpful to everyone. - So corporate got your evaluations, And they wanted me to double-check Is that really how you feel about Michael's situation? Yes. - That is not how he seemed to me. I thought he seemed fine. - You marked "severe" in all the categories, Including "at risk for homicidal behavior." - I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard. - We can do that. - Right in here. Easily. Knock, knock. Pam? Perfect. Um, I was hoping to talk to the office administrator About a little office administration problem. - But of course. - Great. The problem, unfortunately, Is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything from the past three years. There is nothing that says That you're office administrator. - So weird that there's no paperwork. At all. - Although, like, unlikely things happen All the time. My best friend in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy Who lived only two streets away from her in America. - Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back The way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit Admit Admit what? I don't want to say it. Say it. - Say that I'm lying, or say I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe. Statements of such a nature, While they have their place, are overused In a competitive business environment. Great. Well, let me know if you need a new chair, Or anything that an office administrator can handle. Will do. Could I get one of those nameplates That says "Gabe lewis"? - For sure. Anything else? I'll get it right away. The first lesson of watching World poker tour at 2:00 A.M.: You play the opponent, not the cards. Is that what we're here for? A crystal wizard. I like it. - It's a pewter wizard, holding a crystal. Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? I can come back and get it for you later, But I'm saying right now, we can't do that. Right. 'cause I'm here Revenge. - That's it. - Okay. - Let me know if I can help you with anything. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? - I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me. I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about what happened. - You work on commission, don't you? - Stop, stop. - No. Hold on one second. Did you just say you remember him? Of course. But, uh, he looks much less threatening now. What does that mean? We had a safety concern. We very politely indicated that he'd be welcomed back Good morning. - If he were in accordance with our dress policy. - What? - The bloodstained hands. It was beet juice. I'm a beet farmer, id - I'm very sorry. - Good sir. I happened to have been working a very long day that day, When I came to your fine estab You are so I'm gonna Okay, listen, you can't treat Thank you. Good morning, sir! Okay. - You made a big mistake! Huge! - There it is. All right. - That was pretty good. - Thank you. Please. I'll take the wizard. Uh, okay. - You forged them. You forged the forms. - You filled them in and faxed them yourself. - Yes. - You remember that. - Yes, but you had me so worked up That I made a mistake. - Unless a part of you made that mistake on purpose. - You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby. Then it's no longer a mistake. Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet. I wanna mess everything up So I can fix it and keep my job. - Good thing I'm here, 'cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous. Aah! Okay. That's your notebook? All right. All right. Let's bang this out. Let's do it to it. That's the office, huh? Look at that.   Right, oh.. I wonder why, uh It feels like that. Psychiatrists tend to be more crazy than their patients. Therapists are whores. Psychiatry is a narcissism machine. I learn more from Dr. than from Dr. Froyd. Earth. You don't have to be crazy to live here. But it helps. I don't know Just use the best one.

Tomorrow we have to give the theater over To the Scranton's miss fitness pageant. I am so excited, but I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry. - What? - Yeah. That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy. Gabe is not coming, which is huge, Because my plan is to make Erin Fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men Can't resist a man singing show tunes. - Oh, who else is going? - Everyone. Gabe seemed to think no one was going. What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully ill informed, all right? Excuse me, Clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right? Andy, what time's it start? - 8:00 P.M.

Oh, we wanted to, But our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry. Dwight? Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, A man dressed as a cat sat on my lap. It would mean so much to me If you came to my show tonight. I can't, Andy. It's too hard. That's I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that? If it makes you feel any better, No one who auditioned for the part of sweeney Todd Got that part. They had to bring in a ringer. This guy's, like, world class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man And come to my show? I wish I could, Andy, But I can't. I have plans that night.

Give me the punch card. No. If you want to punch the punch card, You have to take me to the show. That is not in the contract. Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate? All right, fine! I'll go to your little show, But I'm not wearing a cape. Thank you. Dwight and I have a contractual agreement To procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me? Well, that would be permissible Under item 7c, clause 2, so I would not object. Hey. How are those salads? It's my own fault My parents used to scramble to find babysitters So they could take my little brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just tonight, I mean, if you could We'll keep looking. - Yes! - Really? I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about. Oh, my gosh, that would be amazing. - Yeah. - For a lot of reasons. Yeah, I know. Neiche! Oh, hey, guys. You brought balloons to a play?

Nope. - Guys? - Hey! - Andy! - Hey! You all made it. Thank you so much. You should actually thank Erin. She's the one who agreed to babysit. She's babysitting? I really wanted to see Andy's play, Because he's so, so talented, But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The 13-year-olds in this town Have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters' club. I understand. This is like Huge opportunity for her. This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people From bringing in balloons. Hey, I think this guy playing sweeney Todd is my plumber. No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber. No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently, the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition. Are you kidding me?

See if I got any last-minute "break a legs" Or "I still love you" type texts. -  by the seaside, ooh-hoo  Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my facebook wall. - Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production Of sweeney Todd, The real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph. Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her! You found johanna. That monster of a judge Has locked her Locked her away There's a little bird uttering around. Do hope it ceases chirping. How is that funny? The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off yourBird. Oh, for the love turn your phone off! There are signs! Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket This whole time. He's gone to sleep now. I closed his beak. Mmm[laughing alone] What is the news of my darling daughter johanna? You know what? Let me just double check, Make sure that bird Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, sweeney Todd! See? It all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, Because of all the razors That you have laying around. And you spend time alone, But you're a barber, so that'legit. So there's that. But Where is johanna? - A madhouse. - A madhouse? - Yes, a madhouse. - A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose All the wig makers of london Go to obtain their human hair? Do you think So you think So you think fogg's asylum, why not? Sounds like cece. Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax. Oh, my God, go, go. Oh, my God. That's really irresponsible of Erin. S a ible bysitter. I just didn't think you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and then get some ice cream And then go home. Okay, this was pretty simple. Why are you here? All you had to do was play with her For, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed. Then we were kind of hoping That you wouldn't touch her again. Babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way. I'm sorry. I just I really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, And you set me up with a car seat and everything. Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital or But why would I take her to the hospital? You know what, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Why don't I just take her home, And let you guys finish, And then you should stay out as late as you want. No, we're good. Thank you, though. - Yeah. - Thanks. Okay. All right, bye, cece. - Okay. - All right. Well, we're never leaving the house again. Not together. That was more horrifying than nunsense. All that singing got in the way Of some perfectly good murders. Where's my car? Come on. Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots. - Darryl? - Hey! Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet? Silent. Look, congratulations. Thank you. I had no idea. This plumber has pipes. Yeah, good job. Well done. You're the guy who booed me. No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of them. No, I saw you, And you were the only one. Get your eyes checked, chucklehead. Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work. Thank you. You didn't have to boo him. Well, he was getting a lot of applause, And I just didn't think it was indicative Of how people were really feeling. How would you like it if we booed you? That would never happen. - Okay. - Boo! I appreciate the feedback. I don't like that at all. Are you ready? Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me! Ah, blood everywhere. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work. Yeah, me, too. Okay, I kill you now. - Okay. - All right. All right, let's do this. No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, And I I'm exhausted. It's okay, I smell. No. No, no, no. I think I just want to go home, But it's okay. This can count as one of your times. No, no, no. Contractually, we're obligated to have sex. Well, I won't tell if you don't. I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What what are you Oh, okay. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. Good night, Dwight. Good night. These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lot of people think it would be the front row, But, actually, right here, This is where the speakers converge And the sound just, like, nails you right here. This is awesome. Sorry. Oh. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party To say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I I'll see you soup. [giggles] Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, And I'm really sorry that I missed your play, But next time, I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise. Awesome. - Okay. - See you later. Thank you. It's like the hurt locker. This night was a disaster. No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of irish cream. Yeah? We could put that in orange juice. - Get it. - Yeah? - Let's get our juice on. - Yeah. [to rhythm of who let the dogs out] ruh ruh ruh ruh-ruh. Found him. Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues? Yeah, I guess you could say that. Yeah, I get those every day after work. Your show was really great, Andy. Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off. It was like amateur hour. It was an amateur production, technically. Oscar, enough with the sass, please! God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome. Stop just saying that. I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse. Thank you. That feels good. I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity. Andy, sing us another song. Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now. Oh, come on, Andy. You were the highlight. Come on, Andy, seriously. Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Okay, all right, all right, all right.  I try to say good-bye and I choke   try to walk away and I stumble   though I try to hide it, it's clear   my world crumbles when you are not here   I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you   I keep my cool, but I'm fiending   I try to say good-bye and I choke   try to walk away and I stumble   though I try and hide it, it's clear   my world crumbles when you are not here   my world   it crumbles   when you are not   here  In the criminal justice system, The people are represented by two separate But equally important groups, The police who investigate the crimes

I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I pick up day laborers And tell them that they'll get paid at 6:00 P.M. At 5:45, a certain I.N.S. Agent By the name of Mose Schrute Throws them in the back of a van, Drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg, And tells them it's Canada. - Hola, amigo. - Hola. TÃº es UN bueno worker? Si.

Avril Lavigne gets them all the time, And she rocks harder than anyone alive. Uh, that's no pimple, Michael. You mean cancer? What? No way. No. Definitely not not cancer. It's just good to catch a Michael train of thought early Before it derails and destroys the entire town. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore. It is? - Yep. Just a cold sore. - Just a cold sore. Thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I didn't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it. I know how you got it. - How? - Michael, come on. A cold sore is herpes. - What? - What you should do, Michael, Is have a doctor take a look at it, 'cause we don't really know what that is. I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is. I've never seen herpes on you. 'cause it's on my genitals, genius. You have a penis? Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs? Yeah. My last physical when I was 40. That was like ten years ago. No, it was like four years ago. Michael, you're at least 46. Why at least? If you're guessing 46, just say 46. Can please talk about how gross Meredith is? This is what you get When you treat your body like an outhouse. You know what, guys? How 'bout we just chill out a little bit on the herp chat? Okay? I was an r.A. In college, And I can tell you, The number one sexually transmitted disease Is ignorance. I guess maybe she could marry a meth dealer with crabs I don't even want to know about these things. Hey, guys. How did this happen? How did I get this? Sometimes it can lie dormant in a woman for years. They may not even ow that they have it. You ow what? I feel like One of those old-timey sailors with VD. Eh, it's me own darn fault. Girl in every port! But what port? The Jan port? The Holly port? Don't even Holly was clean, okay? If anything, I gave it to her. - You may have. - Oh, my God. What if I did? You need to contact Holly. You need to notify her that she is crawling with herpes. Okay. You know what? Might. Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her. You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do. There's no way I'm gonna do that. - Then I will. - All right, I Now, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me That we all have an obligation to the public health To track down anyone who gives us a disease, Inform them of it, And take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge. Hello. Hi, Donna. It's Michael. Michael. I didn't think I'd hear from you. How've you been? I have a disease For which there is no known cure That has been sexually transmitted to me. Oh, no! I can't even say it. HI Oh, my God! RP E.E - W-wait. - S.

'scuse me, everyone, can I have your attention, please? - Not again. - What do you mean, again? You're always asking for our attention. Well, maybe like a year ago. - Mm. Seems recent. - No, that's Andy, the reason it seems more recent Is because many of us here have never stood up And asked for everyone's attention, And it seems like you've done that on several occasions. Everyone, I've noticed that We've not been entirely kind to one of our own, Due to stigmas and prejudices. Oh, when you got your new phone That's when you asked for everyone's attention. World cup. That's what I was thinkin'. You kept announcing scores. It's the world's only international sport, so This is hoy. No, this is Holly. No This is Holly. No, this is Holly. NoThis is Michael Scott. Busted. So what can I do for you, Holly? I'm calling because There was a terrible car accident. Oh, really? Was anyone killed? A lot of people. - Any nuns? - Three nuns.

But you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's. No. In the beginning, we were not good. WellThere was a bit of a learning curve In the conversation department, But between the sheets, We were like Jordan and pippen. Well, if there's anything exciting about it, It was because we both knew it was wrong. - Because we worked together. - No. Okay, imagine there's a princess Who falls for a guy beneath her station, And the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it, And so it makes her want to do it all the more Just to get at the queen. - Am I the princess? - No, I'm the princess. And the queen. Okay.

You I used to think that she was the one. Or at least a "the one." And if I called that one so wrong Herpes, like all stds, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences? It feels unbelievable. Okay, I guess we can make a pros column. Feels Unbelievable. Okay. The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing. Express love. Magical. It feels amazing. Um, okay, is that different from feels unbelievable? - Yes. - Then I will write it down. The feeling of pure risk. Creed, I had that in the cons column, But It's thrilling. Okay. Um, then We'll move that. "thrill of risk." Andy, aren't there also negatives to sex? Yes! Thank you. Such as Unplanned pregnancy. Yes. Unplanned pregnancy. - Like Jim and pam what? - Hey.

Who can tell me the safest form of safe sex? - Condoms. - Incorrect. The only true form of safe sex Okay? Abstinence. Oh! I didn't realize we were doing Trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski. I just thought I'd bring it up In case someone here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody? Andy, that's way too personal of a question. Well, someone could answer it if they wanted to. Okay, in that case, I will now show you how to put this condom on using This pencil. oh, God! What? Why choose a pencil, Andy? Well, I'm not gonna use my penis, Oscar. It's not exactly hard right now anyway. Come on, give it a rest, pencil Dick! I'm doing this for you, Meredith! - I didn't want it! - Well, did you WhyDidn't Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now? Whoa! It'll go away in time. Just don't touch it. Did I make more of what we had Than was really there? What did you think we were? Just a Quirky indie movie Weird sorta thing Breakin' all the rules But had to end Because the summer was over. For you. - I-I think that for you to have come here Even expecting That we could have a conversation like this Shows how how self-deluded you are. Michael, yourMemory has failed you greatly. Jerk. Michael So this is a chef's kitchen, Which makes it perfect for real entertainers. Real entertainer, like Billy Joel. - Michael. - Carole. How are you? I'm great. How are you? I'm great. I saw your sign outside, And I decided, I'm gonna pull in, And maybe I'm going to buy a house from her. Oh. You didn't call my office And ask them where I was? No! that's so 'cause the receptionist told me that a man called, But he would only say that he was my ex-lover. - Weird. - Yeah. Sounds like a nice guy. I don't know, I mean, people were being really mean to Meredith But this wasn't really about Meredith, was it? You and Erin were broken up How is that relevant to anything? I asked you if it was okay if I asked her out. You said and I quote "my good sir, nothing would make me happier Than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand." I specifically remembered it Because you said it in such a weird way. Well, the only reason I said that Is 'cause you asked me so politely And it was very difficult for me to say no. I'll let this slide. But I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you. Oh, wow. Another living room. It's a family room. You put the tv there. You put your family here. Michael, why are you here? Somebody told me That I romanticize relationships. You know, we all do that. I have herpes. What? Did you have that while we were together? I just found out today. It's It's right there. Oh. Oh. What, that's what you're talking about? - Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. Did you have a doctor check it out? I'm between specialists right now. Yes. Yes, Michael. Actually, you do make a bigger deal out of things Than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date. Well, I believe in love at first sight. Well, so do I, But we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking. I know what I was thinking at the time, But right now, it just seems ridiculous. Excuse me. Someone died in the upstairs bathroom, didn't they? No. We should Schedule meetings, 'cause the days can slip away with chitchat. Are you crying? No. I'm just sweating. I don't know what's got you upset, But my advice is Stop crying. I'm not crying. I'm sweating. Look, you need to pick yourself up. Man up, all right? Son, you will win this in the end. It's all about heart And character. Be your best self. Okay. Yeah. I have no idea what his problem is. It's just my standard advice. It's good advice, right? This is Holly flax. I can't come to the phone right now, But please leave a message At the sound of the tiny truck backing up. Hi, Holly, it's Michael.

And the only reason I got out of the sales game Was to be reluctantly called back in. - You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager. - [laughing] no, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me? - You don't? - No! Okay. All right! -  knockity-knock, don't knock back  Just kidding, you can knock. It's your office. Do you have a minute? - I'm very busy with time-sensitive work. - Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, But I can tell by the reflection in your glasses That you're entering points into weightwatchers.com. - If you don't enter them immediately, You forget. What? - I'm starting a band, and I need you on keyboards. - Nah. I play for pleasure. - This is for pleasure. - Wouldn't enjoy that. - I'm willing  pay you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - How much? - 60 bucks a session. - That's crazy money.

Michael Scott, dunder-mifflin paper company. - Danny Cordray, osprey paper. - Nice to meet you. - Three of you guys for one sale? - Yeah, well We call it overkill.

I could swear that guy was a male model. - He's ready for you. - Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime.

Thank you. - Jim talked too much. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done. We just got bested. Why is there a door close button If it doesn't even close the door? How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, Jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned. You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him? - We sell better? - Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave? - I would like to stay. This pertains to me. - Why don't you go outside andTake a shot of insulin And have a nap, okay? - Why do you always assume I have diabetes? - I don't know. Your frame, your build. Why don't you have a glass of apple juice And tell me you're not a diabetic. - [grunts] - See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up That you have--okay. Yes, Phyllis? - I could try to seduce him. - Oh, my god! - I know how we can learn his tricks. What I'm about to show you is of the utmost secrecy. - Is that your office? - Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaky, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell. - Ehh - I'm outta here. - This is weird. - You know what this is? This is a stinger. - A what? - Like the movie. - Oh, you mean the sting. - Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers? - Nope. Different movie. - The sting.

SoThe song is from the point of view of a little girl. - Yeah. - But you're singing it. - Yeah. But I'm using my falsetto. - No, that's not a good idea. It's not a very good song. - Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better If you actually sang with some soul. - Oh, I never sing with soul. - That's a lie. - I could sing it. - I just was hoping maybe You'd save youvoice In case we did a novelty song about frogs. - But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan. - Okay, three-way argument Between a drummer, a keyboardist, And the front man le singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-- - I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here. - Hello! - Oh, no, no, no.

What about this one? It's kind a bad ass, right? Just seems kind of crazy in the way I might need right now. I don't know That's not yours. Stanley just drunk OJ out of my mug and didn't seem to realize that wasn't his hot coffee, so the question has to be asked Is there no limit to what he won't notice?

Might have something to do with the prize. Maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton/Wilkes-barre coupon book, Worth over $15,000 in savings. Stop. Too late. If I was the real Scranton strangler, You'd be so strangled by now. And if you're out there, strangler, You will get caught. By me. Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us That he's not the Scranton strangler. To my chickens, I'm the Scranton strangler. Oh-ho. That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up As ol' Dwight Schrute's mom. - What? - You're only 1/3 as beautiful And about half her height. I am supposed to be olive oil. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, But Jim doesn't want to put his costume on. I am Popeye. I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for, heh. And then, this morning, Pam hands me this little number. No. - In case you can't read my-my-my poker face We will be reviewing our sales policies. I have ten seconds to explain them Or this whole place blows up. MacGruber! Lame. Why don't witches wear panties? Oh, here we go. Because they need to grip the broom. - Oh! Who likes to water-ski on Lake Erie? No, what Where does Dracula like to water ski? Lake Erie.

I feel like you might win the whole thing with that. Thanks. Everyone realizes this coupon book Is not actually worth $15,000, right? You'd have to spend $200,000 on crap you don't even need To get $15,000 worth of benefits. Heh, I'm not the only one who sees this, right? No. - No, it - no. I get that. I get that.

They're both handsome. Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent Most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like? - I think he - hey, hey, gang, quiet. Here she comes. Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam. So, four years ago, When I was in Stanford, Connecticut And dating someone else - Mm-hmm. Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously The greatest love story ever told, Given how much people are walking on eggshells around us. We were basically Romeo and Juliet. - That's right. - Except where Juliet Doesn't have that great a time, And Romeo doesn't call back after two dates. Yikes. But I've learned to love again. He's a cartoon sailor. no. And he looks so handsome in his uniform. Please. No, I'm not gonna no. Tuna. Tuna. If you want us to skip this party I don't care. I am never gonna forget What Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way. You know what eleph buh this This sucks for Jim, right? But it also sucks for us, Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. Yeah, and, like, everyone's gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl, creed's a maybe. Creed's going? Madge from the warehouse Just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago. Erin, would you please do me a solid And get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone. Hello. Hi, Darryl. Come out here, please. I'm good. You need to stop being so shy. Come out here and embrace who you really are, Superstar. This is embarrassing, Michael. Yeah, I bet it is. If you're gonna do your job well here You gotta get used to being embarrassed. Let me put my shoes on. Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? Same button as you hit before. Or sit on it. This whole delivery/sales idea, You know whose that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits. So what happened? I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then, corporate comes up with this idea. But you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet, We're going to call them. We're going to put them on speakerphone right now. And we are going to straighten this out. Screw corporate. They probably stole the idea anyway. Corporate stole nothing. Okay? Darryl brought this idea to me, And then I told them, giving Darryl full credit. So no need to "screw corporate." Everyone, let's give Darryl a round of applause As planned. I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now. He went to Gabe behind your back. No, he didn't go behind my back, He went over my head. He went over your head to go behind your back. What is taking someone from behind? No, shh, Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. It makes your job superfluous. It was a good idea, though. Yeah, here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea. - Hey, Danny. - Hey. I'm really sorry, But we can't come to your party tonight. Ah, I was looking forward To throwing some darts with you guys. - Well - Okay, well, then, Maybe we could do it Like next Halloween. - Oh, for sure. - We're just, like, Totally caught in the middle here. What are you talking about? Well, Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go. Jim and Pam really don't want you to go? They're really upset About the whole Danny situation. I'll talk to them. Yeah, but just don't tell them That we said anything to you. Okay? Okay. Or you're dead. Okay. Okay. Kelly. Great costume. - Thanks. - Oh Kelly! You cannot change costumes In the middle of the day! Pam, she's out. Um, if I'm out, I'm gonna Sue this entire company For discrimination! Guys, you're arguing over a 1 in 16 chance. Over a prize worth Um, 15,000 bucks, Oscar. Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam. This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment 'cause she's so blech. But she did a good job. I really want that coupon book. Garbage magnet. Garbage magnet. God, magnets are interesting enough. You don't need to tart 'em up with some design. I can't believe this doesn't make you mad. What the hell are they talking about? Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique. Do you think Kevin is going over my head? I don't oh, my God. Okay, all right! All right! All right, you know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, It goes through me, And then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand? - I am so sorry. - Oh, you're sorry? - I just thought - what did you just thought? Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk, And so then I told All right. I told him that there was this one cool move Where she powers down like a robot. Okay. Okay? But I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you first. Well, don't let it happen again. You think that I would let this happen again? No way, Jose! I'm you, Gabe. Okay. Can you imagine? It's just crazy. That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party. Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it, Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here With, you know, our history. Oh, my gosh. Everyone keeps blowing that out of proportion. It's not even a history. Exactly. It's not like you guys had some long relationship, right? Big, painful breakup I don't know about? - Two or three dates. - It was two. Was it two? I thought it was three. No, we, um We had plans for a third, But then, I don't know, You never called me back, so Ooh. You can't handle the truth. Well, that does not sound like me. Yeah. It was, though. That's what happened. Well, great. I just wanted to make sure things weren't weird. Okay, this whole "going over my head gate" Is making people act weird. Chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like lady gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters And not be mad at each other. I'm not mad. Are you mad? You went over my head, and then you lied to my face, So my head and my face have taken a beating. Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you. Okay, that might help, If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody - Mike. - In front of me. You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing. So that's it? - That's it. - Is it? Yes. Suck it. Bill Compton from true blood. How many freakin' vampires Am I supposed to care about these days? I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer. Oh, yeah. Stupid coupon booklet. You see my costume? I'm a rational consumer. Yeah, I heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line. Okay, everybody, after you walk the runway, Everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book, And you can't vote for yourself. Pam, can you vote for other people? Got to get in on this. Hey, it's cool, man. I work in the warehouse. I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive, But I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk! Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads. Michael, this is a bad idea. What's a bad idea? Dressing up as somebody I mean, when has that ever worked for you? Never! Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl. Could you for once just let us enjoy a party Instead of making it about all your issues?  get a jolt from my electrode   they did the monster mash   the monster mash  He's a warrior.  they did the mash  Yes. Yeah.  they did the monster mash  I present to you the "rational consumer." As it were.  Igor on chains backed by his baying hounds  Slow. Nice and slow, honey, yeah. Angela as a nurse. Don't slow it down. There it is. I don't like your tone. Look, they were sold out Of all the other costumes, okay? Think we all live in the real world here. Let's not pretend to be unaware Of what sells in this office. What should we ask? Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend Who backstabs people in the back? We have one question to ask the spirit world, And you want us to ask that? He says no. Ah, Darryl moved it. You moved it. No. Hey, Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right? Let's just say I saw Exactly what the two of you wanted me to see. I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down With the post in your mouth. If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl, What would that word be? "a" "s" "s". "h". No. "e" "t". An asset. Aah! Aah! That's enough. I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think. I don't think you get it. - Hey. - Hey. This is some party, huh? When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Mm? Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back? Are you serious? Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everybody Has to fall in love or anything. I'm just saying, but to, you know, To not even call her back is Know what it was? I think she gave me her number, But then, like, her fours looked like eights, and then Could be. But you also called her the second time, So you had the number right. Halpert, you looking for someone to bang your wife? - Nope. - Okay. You want to know? I didn't call her back Because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.  grooving from side to side  Wait, she hasn't moved in a while. Erin. Er Two. I got two. I ate two whole apples. I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it. Just tell her the real reason. You honestly want to know Why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago? Hey, she had a nice time. It seems rude. I did. Yeah. And it's one of those things That's just gonna keep gnawing at me. Like gnaw, gnaw. "why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why." okay. Honestly, I didn't call you back 'cause I thought you seemed a little Dorky. - Hey, man - Thank you. Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? Okay. Well, excuse me. In the future, you need To get Michael's approval On anything before coming to me. Thank you. You're gonna miss out on some good ideas. Okay, well, obviously, If it's a really really good idea, Then my door is open to that. If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no. - You said no to this one. - That's okay. I make one mistake in 15 years And you drag me over the coals. After everything I did for you? - What have you done for me? - Oh - What have you done for me? - Well Ed truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done was say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years. Oh, dropping bombs, right? Must really make you think, Michael. Stop it. Stop. Stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it. Yeah. You don't have to point to the fact That we're thinking about it. Stop it. Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, We will put it in a hat And then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat And let her decide. I don't understand the point of the hat. You're right. We don't need a hat. I am not budging on the hat issue. Okay, we're gonna table the hat question. The best ideas are gonna come to me. I make the final decision. Period. Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo If we disagree with Gabe. - Okay. - Fair enough. Why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael. Michael brings it to me. No one calls Jo. Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo. Then we'll give her a call. Cool. Yeah. I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm sorry. I was a jerk. Friends fight. Friends fight. What's up, man? Sometimes it seems like It was better down in the warehouse, you know? When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, The Cornell daily sun. This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column Bernard's regards. This was your freshman year? I started to ask myself "do I have big plans here?" I didn't want to become editor of that paper. So I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall. And that's actually when I heard Eight male voices singing, Unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company Your a cappella group? Come on. We're going to Danny's bar. Public school. No, I got some work to do. I do have big plans at this company. To be honest, I still can't believe He didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back? Spinach in a can. Powerful spinach. A-gah-gah-gah-gah. - Aw, my hero. Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes. And the winner of the costume celebration spectacular And the Scranton/Wilkes-barre coupon book, Oscar Martinez. Really? If I have to vote for someone I don't want it to be someone who can be me. Shake things up. I'm an inner guy. Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like freaky good.
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately, it's that time of year and according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of time more bacteria per square inch Than a toilet seat. That's true. That's true. I dated her mama. And you know what? Stop. One of the simplest ways to cut down On the spread of germs is to use something Called the vampire cough. Did you say vampire? Oh, no, it's just that, if a vampire had to cough, He would do it like this. [coughs] - Uh-huh, right, And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is In Transylvania? 'cause of the euro. Well, other things you can do To help cut down on the spread of disease Are to wash your hands regularly, Don't come in if you're sick, And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand-sanitizing stations Around the office. No. No, no. They will cost you your life. Elaborate. The worst thing you can do for your immune system Is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared About our well-being, They would set up hand-desanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, Fecal matter. - I'm not going to do that. - Exposing yourself to germs Is the best way to make yourself stronger. So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you. Yes. I would welcome it. [sneezes] You're welcome. The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, Enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. [sneezes] I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever. [cheerful music] Jim. Pam. And the precious bundle of God's best everything. I wish you both a pleasant day. And you too. Yes. Praise God. Okay. Cece's getting christened today. - Big day. - Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that. Nope. Top o' the Sunday morning to you. And a top o' the day to you too, sir.

I invited everyone in the office Because it's not a day for just Jim Or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate My joy and our all of our joys. Ah, man. Does the nard dog want nard pups? Yeah. I want a big old litter of nard pups, All jumping around and sucking on the teat. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.

The big guy and I, we've got some catching up to do. [imitating Marlon Brando] hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over. Oh, Michael, this is just for family. But I'm the godfather. It is really funny, but you know That can be confusing at a christening, Because you are not the godfather. [imitating Robert De Niro] are you talking to me? - Okay, your turn. - Scooch, Before I shoot you in the head. Okay, Michael, um, You know I love when you do that voice, But today, I'm so sorry, Need you to tell me that you know You're not Cece's godfather. Yeah. I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it.

[applause] Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone That the "halberts" have been kind enough To host a reception next door Immediately following the service. Mm. No. Wrong both counts. Okay, 'a, ' "halbert"? And, 'b, ' I think a more appropriate statement would be, "the halberts are hosting an intimate reception For their invited guests."

Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? They don't think. Hmm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home To someone as cute as you. Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby? I don't know. I'm just hungry. Okay, well, you know what, everybody's hungry. Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.

I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are. - Shh. - Right now, Jessica's children Have to walk 12 miles to a school with dirt floors. No. It's gonna be three months of hard work, And when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos. Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my 11th commandment?

My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member From a burning building, But what if the earth was your building And all the people on it were your family? What if the moon was your car And Jupiter was your hair brush? - Shh. - Thank you. Or should I say gracias? [applause] [sighs] Cece went down. What was this? You're out of it. - Scones. - I didn't get one. Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either. Is it just the one jug of apple cider? Who the heck was that?

You could feed the hungry. Us. Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time. - Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together. We are hanging out right now. You want some more of this? Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party. Church isn't a party, Michael. - Well, it's it's - welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid? No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together And do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think You're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie mean girls.

I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going. Michael, this is irresponsible. It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident About a decision in my life. I agree. I think it's superb. Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales. You know what, my job will be here when I get back. Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport. You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico. Hey, right? Michael, what am I supposed To tell my clients if they ask about you? Tell them that I died And I turned into an angel, And, when they feel a breeze In a room with all the windows closed Or that that chill on the back of their neck, That is just me watching over them. Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts? Tell them that I'm in a meeting. Michael, I am just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount? - No, you may not. - Gah! I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave. Thank you. Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming! I will not stand idly by While these Mexican villagers are sick. We're actually building 'em a school. Whatever. I won't I won't stand for it. See you in a few months. If the whole world were like you guys, We wouldn't have so many problems. Mm. That's not gonna happen. We're one in a million. I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs And friends and families To do manual labor for three months. Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, And that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Gonna need a contact lens case, Some sunscreen, some sandals Why you always got to be so mean to me? Uh, meemaw, where's Cece? I don't know. I lost the purse too. Okay. - Good-bye, Lackawanna county. How long till we get to Mexico? Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. So, like, two days basically. Maybe more. Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What? I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or Why aren't they building it themselves? They don't know how. Do we know how? I don't know how. - Well, Carla knows. - You know how? Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?

We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything. If we went to Mexico, We'd probably screw everything up anyway. Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay? Stop the bus! Both: Stop the bus! Stop the bus! [shouting "stop the bus!"] Okay, stop the dang bus. Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world.

Is anyone still at the church? No. Actually, most of them went to go see a movie. What? - Shut up. - Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then  It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies. - I bet, you guys - Can I come? Lakegun is on. - Do you guys  with that? - Banana bread, but, Fred Northquest had no appetite, he was thinking about his par of new boots.

What happened? - We were behind. - Go to the recorded version. Oh, my God. What song was that? - I wasn't recording it. - What? What song was it? Wait, why do you have to record it? Right now is why, Erin. We're living it. Start recording now. Jim. Okay, they did blinded by the light, And they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it, Jim? 'cause we missed it. If I could get her sleeping normally, I would get my life back. That would be nice, wouldn't it? I can't even talk about it. You know, it's not really necessary for me to sit here Holding her all night. Just go to Gabe's refrigerator, Get a lump of suet Or any kind of congealed animal fat will do, really Tie a piece of string to it, Tie the other end to her toe, Pop the suet in her mouth, She'll be happy for hours. I kind of doubt Gabe has suet. Really? Well Then here we are. Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket. And he kind of needs some help, So he was wondering if you could help him. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Phyllis Vance. Is that white diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor? You know your perfumes. My nanny used to wear that. I just ate an entire seahorse. I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work. But it's totally working. I feel exactly like a seahorse. Look who I found. Yeah, well, I wasn't very hard to find. Let's go ahead and wash your hands. Is this the same dough that you used for the pizza crust? Yeah. Waste not. Right? So these are pizza dogs. These aren't pigs in a blanket. Per Se. Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks. - Well. - Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital. He's the longest baby in this room. What's the longest thing you've ever seen? For me, it was the trail from a jet Erin, you don't have to Yeah, you know what, Erin, you do have to. Michael, you are making this harder Than it has to be. That's what she said. Hey. It's a miracle. She loves him. Oh, I don't know about Love. She loves me. Outside. My car. Two minutes. All right. Something's come up. I gotta go. No, no, no, she'll wake up. No, I have something to do. I know what you have to do. Please stay with Cece. Dwight, I've always considered us to be very good friends. Great friends. Remember your concussion? I do. But you married my worst enemy. - I know. - Well, I think enemy's A strong word. 'cause I think we have a really charming back-and-forth. Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over. - Absolutely. - From Jim. - Well, I don't think that's - do it. What kind of pizza would you like? Surprise me. No. Pepperoni. Okay. All right. And the winner is by two votes, Sam and qu Hey, creed. Do you read Chinese? - Better than English. - What does this say? Hello, u.P.S., still waiting on that five minutes With Erin I ordered.

You're four seasons in a day. You got the autumn thing going on. But if you put on baby Mm. But if you put on a blue It's springtime in the rockies. - Are you all right? - No! Insert it in my mouth. Okay, that's not gonna make Your pizza-eating experience any better, trust me. Oh, try me. Jim, just don't think Of it as degrading. Think of it as you happen to be moving the pizza Six inches this way, and he happens to be biting it. I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading. Okay. Crust first. Okay. Now the beer. Beer me, Jim. Gentle. Now I've got to go meet Angela. What? No, wait. You said you were gonna help us. I have a legal obligation To Angela, okay?

What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure? Hey, puck and Finn worked it out, And the solo is now a duet. - Are you kidding me? - No. That's going on. I can't believe we're missing that. Boy, I wish I could see that. You know what, I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, But let me give it this okay. I'm gonna give it a shot. Please, Michael, Just make the glee happen. - Good luck, Michael. - Erin. So how long have you two been going out now? Oh, like three months. I imagine things are starting to heat up. I don't know. Of course, you don't want to rush things. I mean, the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked, We didn't even make love. We just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical. - I have to go, Phyllis. - Really magical. Hey in there. It's me, Pam. It's not Dwight. Don't think it's Dwight. What are you doing here? I know you and Dwight have this weird deal. Um, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone. Are you authorized to do this? Yes. I have been so authorized. Okay, well, tell him That we'll do this tomorrow night instead. Okay. Wait, Pam, Pam. How did he seem? You know, like, did he seem disappointed? You know, there are a lot of guys Out there who would just love And appreciate a woman lik You know what, Pam, just save it. You did this? No, I was just check yes. I did. Yes. Yes. Why won't you like him? What is there to like? He's just he's a weird, little, Skeevy guy with no waist. Why do you care whether we like him or not? I care if you like him. Why? I'm not your father. All right. - Okay. - Go to your room. What? Go to your room, young lady. Um, I'm not going to my room. You listen to me. You listen good. You are not to see that boy anymore. You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do. As long as you are living under this roof, You are going to do what I say. I hate your roof. Oh, do not raise your voice to me. I'll raise it all I want. I'll raise the roof. I will pull this car over. I hate it. I hate your car. See you, Oscar. If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously if you break that girl's heart, I will literally kill you and your entire family. Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun. That girl's gonna Rn my hair gray.
- Uh-oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen up, listen up. Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation. - My bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet, so - uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'cause otherwise, we can't do any work. - Uhtry "password." - Nope. - Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero. - No. - Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one. - Okay, I'm not doing every number. - Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up? - Uhit was, like, eight years ago? - Lord of the rings stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time. - Um, everyone was getting their driver's license. - Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again? - Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been glasses, turban, ear hair, fatty 3, shorts, fatty 2, lozenge, and fatso. I think lozenge was the one who installed it. - I got it. Try, um-- [coughs] - you know what, it made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended. - Big boobs. - Drama queen? - Nosy? - You're typing "big boobs"? - I'm trying everything. - Try "big boobs" with a "z." - That's-- [ding] the password. We're in. - All right. - Wow. - Yes. - The important thing is this kept us secure, people. [cheerful music]   - Morning. - How's it going? - Hey, I'm wuphf. - I'm facebook. - What's up, facebook? - I sent you a facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back. - You should've sent me a wuphf. - A what? - When you send a wuphf, it goes to your home phone, cell phone, Email, Facebook, twitter, and home screen. All at the same time. [phone rings] [melodic tone] [robotic voice] Wuphf. [together] - Wuphf! - Dot-com! - Thanks, Erin. - Sure. Pam. - Mm-hmm? - I don't wanna be a lousy snitch. - Okay. - Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as office administrator-- - Oh, it's okay. - But it's not for-- - let it go. - Yes, I invested in wuphf. It's actually a really great idea, and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but Hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set. - I think an INVESTORS ski trip, frankly, is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience. - I love it. - I was looking at a Trail map, and I was thinking that We should start on a Bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop. - Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company. [slaps desk] - You're kidding. - We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way. - You and me, baby. - New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today. - Don't you work here full time? - [chuckles] Today I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet. - Mm-hmm. - Or we could do that together. If that sounds fun to you. - That does sound fun to me. - Awesome. - Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff. Mattress quality. Every fall, growing up, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a Maze out of hay Bales for us kids to play in. We called it hay place. Eldred called it hay world. Eventually, lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay place lives on. Watch it, watch it. Hello! Welcome to hay place. A place for hay. - Don't forget to make a Broom. - Oh, the petting zoo closes at 2:00, and the goat roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy! - Hey. I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay. - Roll in the hay, five dollars. - No, I meant - Oh, our contract. - Mm-hmm. - Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. Uh I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. - Perfect. - So, uh excuse me, get off of there. Those are show Bales, not play Bales. - All right, Thank you, I will-- I will send the contracts over right away. All right. Whoo! I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest-- if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob I can pretty much sell anything. - Commission comes out to dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero. - Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, kev. - I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right. - You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero. - What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap? - It's a new corporate policy. - Dunh-duh-na-dah! - Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love? - A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right? - When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'cause it's policy. See what I mean? - Nope. - Nudity makes me uncomfortable. - Okay. - My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just-- keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room. - Excuse me, everyone. Sex! Now that I have your attention - you don't have our attention. - Money! - I'm listening. - You had me at "sex." - Pervert. - You have all of our attention just by screaming anything. - That's good to know. [screams] - What do you want to say, Michael? - Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan. - How's everybody doing? - Whoo! - Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the wuphf empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. Great. - Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some m.L.K. Dream for equality. I want to own a decommissioned lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space. - For my current Investors, things are going great. - We already have a buyer. - Really? Who? - Washington university. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions. - At least. - So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family. - Oh, god. Hold on to your wallets, ladies. - Did you ever think of wuphf as an EMERGENCY notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks? - No, no--Oscar, it's not-- it's not a digital rape whistle. Wuphf is about fun. - That's right. - Fun, communication, connection. - What's your money situation? - Well, it's tight, as with any start-up. - Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion? - We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming. - I'm sorry, nine days until what? - Bankruptcy? - Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend? - How long do you think a week is? - No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles. - Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So what now? Pam. [sighs] Okay, now I've tried everything. - Did you prank Dwight? - No. - Well, you like that. - Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work. - I love you, but I'm kinda busy, so I need you to figure this one out on your own. - [blows raspberry] - [chuckling] - Oscar said Wuphf only has enough money for nine days. - Check this out. - All that color. - Look at that. Triple your investment by January. - Anyone can just throw numbers up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen? - Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John legend. - There you go. - You have his email? - A lot of these guys are just Mac.Com, @ their website whatever. We get that guy wuphfing, it's all over. - I want my money back. - Do not talk like that, Stanley. - Ryan, just tell us your plan. - Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back. [smacking door] Hey, kids, was that fun? - [all] Yeah! - All right. - I wanna go on it again. - Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride. But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. Wow! This brings back memories. [inhales deeply] Hay stacking, hay throwing and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned hay king. I always wanted to be hay king. The world shines on Mose. - Where have you been? I've been waiting. - Uh, can we move this to the end of the day? - No, I--I think you should make time for it. - I found the needle in the haystack! - Hey, congratulations. Do you know what your prize is? - I don't know. - Nothing. Life lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing. - Dwight? - Wuphf T-shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break daytona beach. - Here we go. - Okay? Everyone's like, "hey dude, what's up with all the hotties in the wuphf shirts?" Or, Uh, "hey, what's up with that helicopter?" "It's ry from wuphf!" - "It's Ryan the wuphf guy!" - "Yo, ry from wuphf!" - "He's up there." - "What's he dropping?" "Wow, what's falling on us, man?" Wuphf condoms! out of the sky. - Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground! - Look, this is a marketing campaign. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it? - The first lesson of silicon valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever. - That sounds weird. - No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington university. So monetize that. - Are you guys meeting about wuphf? You know that that was my idea, right? - [gasps] - I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, "and you don't have your phone. "I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. "I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, "and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'" - baby, baby, baby-- - I think I'm gonna stay here. - No, no, no, no, no. - I do, I do. This isn't right. - I help you with your things, and you help me with my things. - But I--it's not right. - [whIspering] I got this, it's okay, don't worry about this. - Is it any particular branch of Washington university? - The Washington university Public health fund. - W.U.P.H.F. - Oh, god. - They only want it for the initials. - The domain name. Yeah, they do. - I move we sell. - What? - Yeah, sell. - Sell. - Get us out of this. - Have some faith in this idea. - If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right? - I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right? - Yes. You alone do, actually. - I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell. [children laughing] - Awesome. - Do you mind if we share this bale? - Sure. - There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there? - Probably. - I mean, wouldn't you think the Ten dollars to build your own Broom would include the hay and not just the instructions? - Mm-hmm. - I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday. - Yeah, instead of hay place it should be pay place. - [laughs] - Don't laugh at me. - No, no, no, I wasn't-- I was just laughing at your joke. - Oh. - Pay place. - Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-me-your-money day. - [laughs] That's humorous. - Thank you. - You guys know how to get out? [kids shouting] - Hi, Michael. - Can't talk, saving the planet. - Oh, we don't recycle. - We don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into Whites and colors? - I'm sure no one asked you to do that. - Eight years. - Listen, I know you really like Ryan-- - no, I won't even consider it. - Michael, I I hate to say this, but You know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something? - Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor. - Michael, I think that that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you. - I think you are wrong. - And there are a lot of other people in This office who have money at stake. Other people you care about. - You may be right. I may be crazy. - Don't. - I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point. - Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing. - I thought it might make me feel better. - Okay. Go ahead. -  But it just may be a lunatic  no. - Ooh, nice, wasting time, here we go. - Hey, back off. It's solitaire. - Hey, kid-- hear you're looking for work. - Talk to me. - How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? - [inhales] - Good. - Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people? - We're working. - Can you at least try to look busy? - [exhales] - The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, "you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat." The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. "I love you, you gay bastard," I said. "You gay bastard," I s-- "gay ba--" "gay B--" - Michael, how's it going, bro? - Good, good, bro. - Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there. - Always have your back. So any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here? - I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money. - Nine days, though. That's, like - look, I know I've tapped you so hard. - Yes, you have tapped this. Hard. - [laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people--people don't give you enough credit. - Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo. - Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower. - So you would think that's a good idea for me to do? - Think about this: You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot-- - Mm-hmm. - Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef. - Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so - we totally should. - Tonight? - I gotta work on this. - Oh, right. What am I saying? Rain check. - Yeah. - And now, by show of applause, we will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of purebred. [applause] Put your hands together for mixed bread. [applause] And Let's hear it for purebred. [applause] Mm. It would appear we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the hay king myself. I pick me! I am your hay king! All Hail your hay king! Did I truck 300 Bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes. - So if I were to call dunder Mifflin and ask for miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you? - You would. And if I were to call your House and ask for your wife, would I get through to you? - My wife passed away a few years ago. - How tragic. Very sorry to hear that. - Thank you. - Help! Hello? Oh! Help! - Consider it a wuphf in person. - You're doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment, you're gonna lose ours. - You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike to sell. - If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell. - I'm betting on myself. - It's a bad bet. - Hello. - Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong? - It's not that we don't believe in the company. We don't believe in you. - All those in favor of selling, say aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay. - What is wrong with you? What happened to you in high school? - Michael, are you that blind? - I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what, even If he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people than get rich all by myself on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground. - You're gonna lose all of our money. - Only If he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save Everybody's money. - Oh that's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time. - You can't have it. - Okay. I won't let you down. - Angela? Angela! - The world sends people your way Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my king Up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And Yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So [phone rings] [phone rings] that's, uh-- [melodic tone] [robotic voice] - wuphf from Ryan Howard. Decided to sell company. Thanks, bro. Hell of a ride. - Thank god. [phone rings] - Gabe Lewis. - Now, listen here, gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them. - Well, jo-- - now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter one. I was born, not into luxury Nor poverty, but into adversity, and for that, I thank the lord. My father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Street and down azalea Lane. Which would later become my-- - All right, good night, gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again, 'cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry. - And fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--
Why? That's all it takes. all feet, no hands and I'll have the pededexterity of a chimp and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. Okay, here we go. Ah, yes. - Do you mind? - I'm sorry, Pam. Allow me to write you an apology letter. You don't have to do that. - D-e-a oops, space, "a. Dear" thank you, hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do. Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, it's okay. You were wrong. It's so hot. Well, "a" for effort, right? Welcome. Start your morning right with a burst of blueberry or try plain. What's the occasion? Dwight said this entry was a waste of space. I would like Du blueberry, por favor. - $8. - $8? Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately. But I am using the same tactics. I have surrounded the enemy and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity, I have installed a timer and motion censors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money. - Mm-hmm. China. China. Michael, how was the dentist? It was great. China. Are you okay? What's wrong? Everything here was made in China, Pam. Yeah, that's where they make stuff. They used to make stuff in America, Andy, but we're falling behind. Did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir. - Oh, no. - Yeah. Right here. It is right there. Anybody read the news anymore? China is on the move. I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read. That's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again. My whole life I believed that America was number one. That was the saying. Not America's number two. England is number two. China should be like eight. Hey, Andy. Hey, Darryl. You gotta stop texting me so much. But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane. You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself, "is this something Darryl needs to know?" The answer's almost always "no." Got it. Then I will call you. No. There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. "I'm comin' over, baby." And I would text back. "B.T.B." Bring that Booty. Dwight. Why is the toilet paper only half a ply? Oh, I'm sorry. Is that not good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is. Okay, um, Stanley, maybe you can just unspool a little more each time you need to don't tell me how to do my business. Stanley, as a fellow dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you, but like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner. Which is you. "Which is you" is not a sentence. I disagree with. Are you gonna just sit there office administrator or are you gonna do something? Dwight, can we talk about these cut backs? Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule an appointment. I'm not gonna do that. Well, then you're not going to talk to new building owner, which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy. Y'ello? Hi, Nate. It's Pam Halpert. Oh, hey, Pam. Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight. Let me just put you on hold st for one eensy second. Sure. - Dwight Schrute. -Hmm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know. Make something up. Hey, Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in a connection with a string of dognappings that have been Dwight. Dwight, can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with. People he's worked with for ars. His friends. You know what, Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business, this is a home. And I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. Oh, my God. What? According to the Internet the tallest man in the world is Chinese. So much for keeping our secrets up high. What's America gonna do? I know what we're gonna do. We're gonna put our best minds on it. Everybody, stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number-one super power. Where forks are irrelevant. And where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now, open your eyes. You never told us to close them. Welcome to your future. What do we do? How do we stop this? How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on. Big ideas, blue jeans, the grand canyon. Who's got one? Who's got a big idea? An idea bigger than the grand canyon? Yes, indeed. Yes, Kevin. An antacid that you only take once a week. - Once-a-week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay, then, we are - Michael. - Yes. An acid pill that you take once every six weeks. Why not go just one for the year? I don't know. It's too big a pill to swallow. All right. What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy and then we all kill him but first we take out, like, a $100,000 life insurance policy? I bet you guys like that idea, don't you? I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing. I don't know what the  that was. I say we bomb 'em. By 2020 they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste r protein. We'll all starve. Yeah, Dwight's right, we should drop the bomb. No, he's not we're not where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are 56 cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine. Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to and it's a projection of 15 years from now. Thank God. No. No, that is right now. Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You betcha. But still agrarian. Most in terms of land not population. Come on, Michael, you couldn't no! No, you're wrong about this. Where are you getting this information? I got it from New York times dot com. - Uh-oh. Getting nervous, Oscar? Okay, someone look it up. I'm on it, Jim. I'm on it. Guys, it's not worth it. Really. Guys this is not worth our time. "Are you watching this?" Seriously? Well, are you? I'm sittin' right here. Got it. China has 56 cities with a population of over one million. The U.S. has nine. Suck it, Oscar. Well, on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael. Great, I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy? So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? I don't care. Okay, now, where were we before I bested Oscar? Wow, so this building can get uglier. I will not work in a roach billboard. Oh, my God. I can't look at roaches. Michael, do something about this. Absolutely. Pam, this is exactly why I hired you as office administrator. Handle it. Takin' care of business. Dwight, take it down. I'm serious. Take it down or else. Or else. Or else what? There's nothing you can do. We can move out. Uh. Really? So does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last two hours? Oh, my God, I've been playing zombie soccer for two hours? I went out to look for a better office space. Waste of time. Not really, because I found one. Oh, wow. These are nice. Yep. Let me see. Look at the huge offices, Jim. Yeah, I know. Check out that conference room. - Totally. - You can't just move out. Oh, in three months we can. Check the lease. And if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey, guys, can I show you some pictures? Oh, my gosh, she's so cute. She looks like both of you. - They're not of Cece. - Oh, cool. This is possibly our new dunder Mifflin office. Well, I like being in the same building as Bob. It keeps me honest. This building isn't far and it's much newer. There's a dry cleaner, a nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next door to an outback so it always smells like steak. Are you trying to kill me? Is the nail place Koreans or whites? Koreans. Good. And the dry cleaners? White? Good. Whoa, there's a lot of brain power in this room. We got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office. Also, in that order. Funny. Jim, that is funny. Very comedically humorous, Jim. I have a computer question. Hey, Oscar? What is it? Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael? All right. All right, I get it. Michael, how do I create a new tab? Try control "p". That's print. Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You're making some very dangerous assumptions, Oscar. Oscar, it must be killing you now that Michael is smarter than you. He's he's not smarter than me. He was just right about one thing. Yeah, but it was really a smart thing to be right about, actually. Actually, it was. Around here Oscar is known as "actually" because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts or correct grammar. Actually, you're speculating. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican. "Megan fox. Question mark." What's that mean? Meagan fox. Come on. You know what? You're one bad text away from gettin' blocked. Yes, but one good text away from a high five. You accept these terms? Oh, it's on. In your perfect world what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list. I wish for a million wishes. Yeah, no, I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about Then see you later, building. You can't possibly be serious. I said see you later, building. - Hey, Michael. - Hey. I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China. I'd love to talk more about it. Yeah. - Maybe over some coffee later? - Sure. Do you know what you just agreed to? - Just coffee, Jim. - No, it's not just coffee. He's trying to set you up, Michael. What's gonna happen is he's gonna try to bring up whatever you're talking about in a very casual way. But secretly he'll be trying to trip you up. And when he does, boom, it's awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the tour de France around him? Yes. And then, he will smugly pay the check and make you feel so small. All right, well, I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay. Okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary. No politics? I'm pretty good on politics. California is bankrupt. And California, California. What? Parlay. My office. Five minutes. Parlay? Pirate code. He wants to meet. So everyone here knows pirate code? I understand it. I can't speak it. Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap. You've been watering down the soap? Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom? We want everything back the way it was. You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart. And 25 years from now, Cece will become world famous for stripping. That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the banks takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die. And my daughter, Cece, dances on your grave fully clothed. Where is Tibet? Pass. - When was China founded? - Pass. Two for two. Keep it up. Who is mao? - Life line. - Damn it, Michael. You are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know. I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs. What do you know about boobs? Michael, I have to tell you something. It's from rocky ii. Thank you. This guy doesn't just wanna win, you know, he wants to burry you. He wants to humiliate you. Wait, wait, wait. How long is this gonna take? I'm like a quarter of the way through. Is it gonna be worth it? No. Just in case, Michael, I made you a cheat sheet. I don't need to cheat. Show him how to use it. Here it is right here. Pull over. Pull over. Oh, my God. No way. Man, look at that. Yeah. There's no building. This can only mean one thing. - Building's underground. - She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam. - Yeah. - Pam? - What? - I'm Pam. - Oh. - No, you're not. I'm sorry, we have a colleague with the same name. Oh, oh, that's funny. You're not a liar too, are you? I've been known to bend the truth. Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it. I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go! I can't wait to do to Pam what I just did to Pam. - Pam? - Yeah. You know, I'm the only one here that you haven't asked about the new office. I know. Because you're the reason we're moving. Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place? Uh, I think it's something like, um What's the exact square footage? Um, let me see. How many offices are there? - Oh, I'll just look at the one-sheet myself. - Uh, actually I don't know what I did with the one-sheet. You know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet. Oh, you're a funny guy, Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm gonna walk down the hall and I'm gonna say, "wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait. I lied about some aspects of the building. It's still on a bike path, though, right? There's no building. It doesn't exist. What does that mean? I needed leverage, so I pulled those pictures off the Internet. It's just this this office administrator thing, I don't want to What? Fail. I don't want to fail. Again. You didn't fail. That's what you said about art school and that's what you said about sales. And you didn't fail those things either. Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated. Did you know that China has a new missile that can sink a U.S. naval carrier We have missiles too. Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal? But what do I know? I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon. I wasn't here. What? I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use. Well, thanks. Yeah. China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives, and they will control us. Actually, we're in a mild recession right now, I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogeyman for all their problems. In the 1980s, it was Japan. How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17%, and in the U.S. It has only risen by 8%? Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2010? Do you know the comparative expansion of, say, the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you? Don't I Hello. Hello. You're breaking the law. Impossible. I love the law. Read article 19. There are certain standards that you have to maintain the building at and that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two and no more tampering with the toilet paper. I see I've underestimated you and I didn't think that was possible. Nate. Re-ply the paper. I don't think it goes that way. - Re-ply it! Don't worry about the coffee. It's on me. Yeah, I figured that. Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat. Wait. You forgetting something? - What? - This chat. Two men. One white. One Latino. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you. Fire him. No. Show mercy. But here we are. What is your point? My point is That as long as people like you and me don't stop talking Nobody can stop the U.S.A. - Yeah, go, girl. - Right. Yes. - I am talking about freedom. - Mm-hmm. About choice. America I don't think you need to worry, because if you want to be China, you will. If you don't, that's fine. That, my friend, is your victory. You know, a lot of people say that if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China and that may be true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation. Raise you cups on high. Case closed. Yeah! That wasn't what we were discu that wasn't the whole they say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam and I might feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. "Not motivated by compassion." Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action. You're gonna scare them away. -  - Yeah, right? That's a new standard.
Got it. Okay, let's go. I'm freezing. People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one. One Charlie's angels. One. Let's go. Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge. Ooh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are, like, "why, I oughta," and the girls are, like, "let's go shopping"? Let's just jump in the air. That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. - Here we go. - Okay, one TwoThree Not everyone jumped. Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go. One, two, three. Still some people not jumping. You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping? I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, - Angela, and Oscar. - I am jumping. You are? Let me see you jump. Oh, my God. This is a store-bought camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that. I'm freezing. Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by "three." I didn't want to miss it. Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. Here's a question nobody's asking - Is this worth it? - Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes? - Why? - I believe in us. - We can do this. - Okay, on three, everyone in the air. Three, two, one, zero. We didn't get it. I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head I shut it down. At its worst it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties. It hardly looks fake. It's so lush. Why does it smell real? AhGood one. Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, little children! Merry Christmas. How's everybody doing today? - Good. - Good. How's the party coming along? - Great. - Are we over budget? - Nope. - No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already? Not yet. Good for you. Angela, lay it on me What's the problem? Nothing. Should be fun. So, Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today? Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine. All right, well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy? - Yeah? - What you got? It's all good, Santa. Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. All right. Good! My kids are growing up. As a boss, I look at that and I say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants, is a is a wonderful Christmas with no drama. It's present time, you guys. Happy holidays from your friends at Sabre. We just want to say how grateful we are. Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do." It's a hello kitty laptop sleeve. Hello kitty's for girls. Nashua got mp3 players. Yeah, I don't even have a laptop. I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white. - Wow - Come on. I said "I wonder." I didn't say "I think." Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets. Blankets? What am I, five? Erin and I make great use of ours. Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating? I'll take one of those pink pouches. I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I TiVoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking. Hey, it's snowing. Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful. Hey, Dwight. Whoo! Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here! Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right? Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You could have killed me! Oh, don't be such a baby. Yeah, who's a little girl now? You apologize to me right now. You've got something on your nose. You apologize right now. - No. - Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter. You got it. That sounds awesome. Can we all do it? No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go. Angela, are you bringing your new boyfriend to the party? I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator. State senator. I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena. Who are you dating in the public arena? The senator. Oh, right. The state senator. We went to a picnic thrown my the comptroller's wife. Oh, that would be impressive If anyone knew what a comptroller was. Well Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony? I do. Two. "Angela" "Over here, Angela" "Here. Look here!" Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that - Yeah! - A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience - of any kind. - Pam? - Pam? - Pam? Wow, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement. - Hi, guys. - Hi. I just wanted to let you know that I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week. Because you've been on the lam? Because the "boring police" have been after you, and they finally caught up with you? No, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case. Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby! Death to Toby! Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements. You leave these huge pauses in your sentences. - What do you expect me to do? - What's the case, Toby? Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high-profile case. - Is it criminal? - Yes. - Have we heard of it? - I don't know. Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave? - Come on. - Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail? Guys, it's a really big deal. He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck! - He's rubbing his neck. - Oh, Scranton strangler! I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. That was the worst joke ever. Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place. Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. Uh, Holly flax She comes from the Nashua branch. What? What? Yeah, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know. Hold on, Holly's coming back here? - Yeah. - Guys, who's Holly? That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover And was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe - a part of my future? - Wow. She's one sassy black lady. Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party. I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an hr rep really warrants a party. You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. - Dwight, get rid of the tree. - Okay. Cancel. We're canceling it. - No, don't throw them out! - No, we have to cancel - We can save that. - No, no, no. We're gonna get fresh for Holly. - I bought these. - These cookies are fine! They're not. Fresh and new. Michael, wait. We don't have We don't have the budget for another party. Well, then, everybody will chip in It'll be fine. I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen. You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. - So back to work. - Oh, boy. Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And you know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away. We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. The name is bondSanta bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. SantaWonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus God! Ow! Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking. Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be You know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be a cool, sleek Santa. Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. - I'll invite him. - Okay. Sure. I mean, unless there's any chance there could be pss at this party. You never know about the press. Well, I only ask because he's a senator. Could he help us with some parking tickets? I don't think that's appropriate. Well, then he's not a senator. - Yes, he is. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. We still doing the gifts today? I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party. Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year. - Me neither. Whew. - Okay. I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear becomes a "bear man." Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good. Okay Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No! - No, it has the little - Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from new Hampshire. Somebody from new Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you. Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Yes, that's me. Come on in. There's nothing classier than boring jazz music, I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?   Hey, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree? I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party. Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us. I will help. Although my 'bridMy hybrid My Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves - on a daily basis. - Yeah. I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup. Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. - I'll ask him. - You know Darryl? Yeah. He works here. We all know him. I should come along, just 'cause he's my You know, he's my hookup. Cool. Come on, now, Justine, look Listen Look, I've been planning this, okay? - You cannot do this, Justine. - I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here. - She did? - Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas. I don't know I thought I was enough family for my daughter. Don't come in, I'm busy. It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too. Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck. Uh, no. Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back. No. Thank you for your interest in my truck. Okay. Sorry. We'll leave you ale. Hey [Sighs you know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it. When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her. I've looked her up online There's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the Internet. She doesn't need an Internet presence You just know. Oh - Hey. - Hi. What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse. We're on recess. I came for the party. Hi. - Hey, everyone. - Hi, Toby. What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings. - Yeah. - That scowl. I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury. And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions. I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking. You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave Raaaaugh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Stop! OhOh! I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it. Aah! Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uhThen "How 'bout icing it? Lol. Dwight." - Hi. - Hello. Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please? I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive. There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake? Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry. Hello. Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard. Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard! Well, I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard. Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh? I most certainly am. - Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! - Unnnnnngh! - D'oh! - Oh, Homey. OkayHolly's back. Hi. Hi. Oh, huggy monster! Oh, not the huggy monster! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Wow. Well, everybody, - you remember Holly. - Hi. Did you bring us anything from Nashua? Oh, yeah. I brought some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, - and I ate some of them. - That's adorable. - Would you put those out? - To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone? Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super-classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers. Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party. Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did! Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your dayyy-esk! Watch out for my guns. They're both loaded. What kind of guns do you have? - Six-shooter? - Aww This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. - Doesn't it? - Yeah, kind of. Yeah. - Oh, God. - Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! - OhI love - Aj gave me that. Well, that's understandable. Still raw. - Woody your favorite character? - Mm-hmm. You know who my favorite character in toy story is? - Andy's mom. - Why? Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie. That is a really good point. Aj said he hadn't seen any of the toy story movies. - You're kidding me. - No. I know. I'm going, "what? Are you serious?" - What a douche bag! - Get a life! Get a Yeah. Good riddance. We sat down and we watched them all in one day. Now he's the biggest toy story fanatic ever. - Good for him. - Next day I found him in my bed. Really? That's creepy. How did Aj get in your house? We live together. Oh, you do? He had a little note pinned to him that said, "you've got a friend in me." - Yeah, Randy Newman's the best. - Yeah. - I love him. - Me too.  Christmas tree, Christmas tree   won't you be my Christmas tree?  Hey, how about this one? Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy. What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie brown. And we just loved it for what it is? Maybe. I mean No, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think Oh Pick a damn tree already. Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too. I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself. Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. How could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents. Well, Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents. Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do. No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas. How do I do that? Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun. Yes! You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night. Hey, guys, the tree's here. - Hey. - Nobody hug me I'm covered in tree sap, so Why would someone hug you? Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome. Are you serious? It's a sophisticated take. He doesn't look like Santa Claus. No, he doesn't. I told her Santa would be here. Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. - And we all got misled. - Who told you that? Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made. So is it an open relationship? Oh, God, no. Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids? Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But Aj and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together. - So where's the ring? - Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move? Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb. You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life. Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away. I don't get it. I'm sorry. I just I don't get it. Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over. - Wow, an ultimatum. - Yeah. It doesn't really seem like you. That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself. Don't. Stop Dwight! - Dwight, stop! - Oh, no. Oh, no! - Stop! - Oh, no. - Yes, taste my wrath! - Okay. Okay - You like that? - Seriously! Okay. Okay. Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when you're gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone. I just want it to stop. So cool, right? There's no connection between - the origin story and the quest. - Okay. We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise it's the bear's quest. Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right? Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is? I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or It sounds like you know what you want. It's also a little derivative of a serial called bear man. Did you look that up? - No. - Okay. - Oh, Jim. Hey. - Hey, Toby. There's this female stenographer at the courthouse - No way. - Who looks exactly like you. - That's incredible. - Yeah. No, it's uncanny. You know what's crazy? I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. Oh! Excuse me. I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. It's so cold. Even with my coat on. Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing Americans. Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy. You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt. What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny, but it also would have been incredibly tragic. I could not agree more. And I just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. With snowballs, Jim? With Fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. Mmm, mmm. Mm-hmm. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York city. - Wait, what girlfriend? - I haven't told you about her. I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit. I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what, I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I'm flying out of Laguardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." I didn't know you had a girlfriend. I do. She is. Did you see her face? Well, it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael g. Scott. And it ain't Tara. So you went homemade this year. - Yep. - Yeah. Money problems Is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out. No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion. Are you good at homemade? Look at this. Yeah. Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving. Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even. What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting. No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do. Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much. Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think It's not possible That Woody did this to himself? It is Christmas. No, it really seems like something Michael would do. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed. Why would anyone frame you for that? Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly? AaaaahhAhh, Ahh! Surprise! It was part of the party. - Pretty funny, huh? - You think this is funny? I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this - When we tell our kids - Yikes. - Oh, my God. - All right! Shh. Okay You know what, Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings. Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore. Oh, really? Well, you certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought. Okay, hey, hey, hey No, fake girlfriends are always wrong. You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you? When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me. Michael, I'm sorry. And we did this whole stupid party for you. No. You guys, it wasn't my fault. Nothing is ever your fault. Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us! I really think you're better off. Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please? Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something? "Hey, pickles, Merry Christmas. "Open immediately? Love, Swiss cheese. Damn it, Dwight! Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all. So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out? No, they bring it in. You lucky son of a bitch. I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for That is the life. Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office? Sure, sweetie. Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A Grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him? Oh, my goodness.   I am the mean old Grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges. Ohh, that sounds fun and christmasy, you mean old Grinch. What kind of challenges? Waahhh Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch? No. You must answer topical political question something like an ob"how many congressmeninch? "Is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?" I don't know. Do you know the other state? Maybe the Grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold. The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! And the game's over seconds later. I'm so glad you could come. It's nice. I know. Hey, everybody, this is my boyfriend, senator Robert Lipton. Hi. Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar. Oscar. A pleasure. Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor. - Hi. - Hello. I'm, uh I'm Aj. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise. I know who you are, and I think you should go. I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you? Was I supposed to bring you guys something? What?

And Merry ChristMas. - Thank you so much. - Merry Christmas. - And Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, thank you. For your feet. It's amazing. 'S so great. Thank you. - For me? - Yes. - Thank you very much. - Mm-hmm. I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation. Wow, that's awesome! A real David and Goliath story. I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work. I am. The real problem is the teachers' union. - Zip it, Meredith. - No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read. Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender? You are. You make your own drink. I'll make it. What are you drinking? An "f" train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters. I don't know how to make that. Okay, well, I'll just stick with my Mohito. And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest. - Annoying. - Yes. I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe. Well, uhI don't think any of us really know. All right. Is it Is it pebbles from the beach in Jamaica? Ooh, go easy with the shaking. Oh, my God. You like it? I love it. Yep, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that. All right, my turn. Oh, um, it's just I didn't I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder. Right. Of course. "The adventures of Jimmy Halpert." OhMyGod. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter. I mean Better office policy up there. It's not as fun as Scranton. But it should be the same policy as us. Michael, wait. Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip. - That's good advice. - Yep. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died. That's a sad story. Yeah, well, at least he was married. Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay. No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay. I shouldn't tell you this, but Aj won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over. Really? Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatumDo you? No. So just be patient. Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall. I surrender. I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent. Anything. You got it. You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch. You're a psychopath. I'll take that as a no. I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it. Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me. No, that's not No, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you. Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt. From the mall. That This is a fast food receipt from April. WellThat God, how many number nines did you order? Is everyone here kind of mean? Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial. - Oh. - Hey I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected. Hey, what happened to Woody? Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him. - He smells awful. - It was blue cheese dressing. Great. - Hey, Mike. - Hey. We wanted to give you something. - Oh. - Merry Christmas. Thank you. A hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much. - What do you say? - You're welcome. Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that? I think I know where he is. - A trampoline - Mm-hmm. - Video games. - Video games. - A horse. - A horse. Are you sure you don't want a pony? - You want a real horse. - Mm-hmm. All right. You have to pick up after them. Hey, sorry. I'm ready. I don't want to go. Oh Come on, bear man. Come on. Have you ever seen 'em do that? I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, it's it's okay. - Okay. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. - Okay, this is it. - What? - Go! Go! Go! - What? What is it? What? Oh, my God! Honey? Jim? Jim! In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear.
Next stop, secretary , we'll read the minutes for Sunday's meeting. Minutes from previous meeting, oh, knights of the night - No! Jim, hey. - Oh. This meeting is for knights of the night only. Knights of the night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the guardian angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the guardian angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think guardian angels. One of our many recent good deeds. We set out to capture the Scranton strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us. I'm actually just looking for my BlackBerry, so carry on. No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs. Ha, ha, ha. Screw you. Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence. What are you gonna do now? You gonna make fun of our leader's weird voice, huh? Dwight, don't be bothered vah, vee, vah, vah, vah. Over the line, Jim. I'm just looking for my phone, so pretend I'm not here. Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of knights of the night. It's our official name, Jim. Sounds good. Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. Smart. And the rest was just boiler plate stuff that's go ahead and read it, some people weren't here. Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag. Oh, come on. That sounds awesome. - It was pretty cool. - Was it? - It was fun. - It was it was pretty awesome. Hey, yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now. January three, 2011. A day which will live infamously. Holly partridge flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise-otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I Okay, let's just switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no. Let's push through. We'll do this. Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by new years or they break up. Now if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy. And I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down. Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly is engaged to somebody else and you want to kill yourself. That may seem like a good idea, but it's not. Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said, "it's snot." I'm so sorry. Okay, so killing yourself I was just thinking about snot. Good morning. Hey, guys. Uh, fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your new year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display the cards on This Resolution board. Wow, did your baby draw that? The glitter is blinding. - Oh, I think it's good. - It's gonna be fun. I recently met sue, the office administrator at vance refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it. She's awesome. I know sue, she's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheel chair, right? - Okay, champagne. - Happy. - Sponge. - Sad. To soak up my tears. Gummi bears and gummi worms. Bears sad, worms happy. C'mon, man. UkulelesHappy? Sad. Something to break. Chocolates. For you, job well done. Thank you. And two bottles of scotch. Both sad. And did you get the tickets? I did, I did indeed. Two front row center to Paula Poundstone, live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up onstage, that would suck. Hey, you think you could do my job better? I don't know. What's your name? Michael. I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life. Oh. Hey, guys. I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is new year's resolution board. Shaaaaa shut up. Hello. - Good morning. - Good morning. What happened? Is there a ring? So, high five me. We're back. To a happy aaaah. Look at those. Mittens. Those a present? Come on. They're warm. Those are so fuzzy and warm. Aah, let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put her there. Give me a good firm one. Ooh, that's a good, firm handshake. You're hired. Yes, well let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Oh, definitely. Yes, yes, right away. - Okay. - Yes, yes. Right away. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat to 90? Smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever. Yes no, what? Stop. Yes. Congrat - wow. - Ooh. Oh, my God. That's it, that's it. Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum. Yes, I told everyone. Ha, ha! Ha, ha! Hey, right back at you, bitch. Happy, happy, happy, happy! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, calm down! Breathe. I'm trying. I said breathe. I'm trying. Wait a second. Are you listening to music? What? Shut that off. I'm not listening to the music. Fine, just go crazy for a little while. Ha ha, whoo! Looking good. You're looking good. Mmph, mmph! Oh, I gotcha, I gotcha! I'm pulling you back! - Michael dance-off! Oh, that's nice. That's nice. Go! Me, okay! Mm, mm, uh, oh yeah! Nice! We're gonna calm down later. I'm doing it. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Right there, right there! Oh, yeah! Hey, Dwight. I'm collecting resolution cards. - Not doing that. - Why not? I've achieved plenty, and there's no better than the best. Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine. Learn to cook for one. Yeah, I love cooking. But I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare. So I figured it's time to start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one. Well, maybe you'll meet someone. No, some people just don't meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad. - Angela. - Yes. "Make time for romance." Who's the senator? My boyfriend. Oh. Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused 'cause you accidentally wrote "the senator." Wait, wait, wait. It's that easy? That's not a resolution. That's just something I wanna do. Okay, fine. I can do that. My resolution is Meet a loose woman. Oh, God. - That's a good one. - Yeah? You know what? That's my new one. I'm taking that one, too. Awesome. You know what you guys should do? Go to the book store at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. "Hey, what book is that? "Cool, let's hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa." - The book store? - It's that easy? I'll come with you, show you how it's done. - Okay. - I'll drive. My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the book store, I can eat my pb&j in the car. Hello. Oh, somebody's got a new phone. - Yeah. - That is neat. I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here. E.T. Phone Holly. Holly like phone? Holly misses old phone. Why? New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception. Oh, bummer. Bummer. Reese's pieces. Reese's pieces? Oh, God. Please stop. I still have my old phone. This thing, indestructible. Oh, I should get this. Hey. Oh, no. Don't go see that one. I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right. Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ? I don't think so. When you broke it off with Roy did you still tell him you loved him? - No. - But you did still love him. - I'm not gonna have - Do you love him now? No! Just talk to her. No, she'd just resent me. Or worse, she would think of me as her friend. Oh, hi friend. Yuck. I'll talk to her, Michael. You think she'd talk to you? Why wouldn't she? That's true, she's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out. There's a plan. All right. We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel. I'll take the entirety of the second floor. I got that cutie behind the counter. - Well, if you read a lot you should check out our e-readers. They're really neat. Oh, I work at a paper company. Those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? Heard those machines are, like, ten bucks a month. Actually, it's $10,000. Holy. What? Let me see that. So light. Like a croissant. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome. Let us know if you need anything. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Why did we pretend like we work here? Is that what we were doing? I don't know, uh Hey, how'd you do? - Good. - Good, real good. - Yeah. - Yeah. I think we kinda nailed it. Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so let's roll. - Cool. - Okay. - What'd you get? - A book about oceans. Oh, really? What else? Let me see. That's, uh, porn. Pornography. Old lady. Nasty porn. Follow my lead. Hey, want some company? Want some company? Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks? Oh, really good. I went to Portugal. I went to Portugal. Oh, wow. You went together? - No. - No. So, I just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ? Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole new year's deadline, but, um, it came and went and we're still together. You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present? It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're gonna be just fine. Just fine. - Whoa. - Hold on. I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution. - Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. perfect role model all the time. I'm telling you, don't do it. I got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that. Well, we can't just go back. I mean, we came out to meet women. Hey, there's a roller rink across the street. There's always chicks at the rink. What kind of chicks are you gonna meet there? I don't know. Single moms at a skating party? Sweet 16, ten-year reunion parties. Chicks fall down, need help getting back up. Roller derby practice. Aah! Rrrawr! We're going skating. The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions. Who's been good about their resolution so far? - Me. - Mm. Erin, tell us about it. Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely. Cool. Here's a little "way to go" gift from sabre. - Intercepted. - Hey. Huh? Whoops. Creed, I notice you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours? I want to do a cart wheel. They're real casual, I think. Not enough to make a big deal out of it. But I know everybody saw it, just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel. How's it going? I'm having a little trouble motivating. One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February. - Or sooner. - Yeah. - It's not a joke. - But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've already fudged on our resolutions? Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time. Since last year I ate none. Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine. Is it? Yes, because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week. Next year? Come on. I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss. And I did it. Bam! Blood everywhere. Not all of us are Michael freakin' Scott. What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man. Do a cartwheel! Well, I can't. I don't know how. You're just going to somersault around for the rest of your life. And you know what's gonna be on your tombstone? Loser. My tombstone's already made, thank you. Just do a cartwheel! This is all I could find. Eat it. You don't have to do that, Kevin. Oh, no. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael. Why are you eating stem first? This is a new food for me. How else should I eat it? Can I get some cheez whiz? Or hollandaise? No, no. No cheez whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on, here comes the airplane. There you goOpen, open, into the hanger, there you go. - Oh, no. - Michael. Yeah, eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it. God, I hate it. I don't care whether you hate it, you said you'd do it! - Michael, Michael. - All right. - Eat it, eat it! - Oh, my God. You're killing him, Michael. All right, all right, all right! - Michael! - Shh! Okay, I ate the Fluffy part. Can I be done? Let me see if you swallowed it. Open your mouth. Under your tongue. Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. Can I get some candy or something? - No, you can't have any candy! - I'll get him water. Okay, Michael. Just settle down. God! Yes, Michael? Not Michael, e.T. What's up? Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. Oh. No, Michael. I don't want to talk about it with you. And I'm fine, I just I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an hr rep here for this. So Kevin and creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room. - You think? - And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me. And it was none of my beeswax. You were super mean. It was insensitive and I am sorry. It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again. I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies. I I care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. Okay, Michael, no offense. But you need to get your own life. You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends. I don't think I'm there yet, boss. - Well, I am. - Okay. All right. - I'm gonna help you. - Okay, okay. Hey, uh, it's just you. Anything you want to hear? Um, Dave Matthews Band. No hits, deep tracks only. Okay. I said, no hits. - Hey, Ryan. - Yeah. How's your fart project coming? That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to. - Me. - Mm-hmm. - Kevin, don't. - Mm. Come on. Oh, Pam? SodaCaffeine. Yeah, just a little. I have a lot to deal with today. Well, if you don't have to do 'em Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant. Okay, no. Oh, my resolution was to get more attention. Nope, she's lying. Hey, Ryan. One, two, three. I did it. I did a cartwheel. You, [Bleep] You! God! - Okay, that's it. - God! Lesson learned. - What's up? - Hey, where'd you go? - To the arcade. - Oh, cool. Why, did you meet someone? Yeah. I did, actually. - Oh? - His name is Andy. And he roller skates like a Greek God. And you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him. Right on, son. Gentlemen. And where did you go? Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club. - Right. - So that's it, guys? If you want I can put on the strobe. Yeah! Do you want to keep this? Do you want to keep this? Yeah. - Do you wanna keep this? - No, you can toss them. My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully. We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine. Just fine, just fine, just fine. I just think we need to cool things down for a while. Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to nashua. Yeah, I'm sure. Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look where you're going to be placing your hand. So pick a spot. - Mm-hmm. - You ready to do this? - Yes, sir. You know what? I'm gonna stay here as long as it takes. I really appreciate it. Go. I did it! You did? A perfect cartwheel. Okay, good!  congratulations. Well, alright, see you tomorrow.
I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct? Yeah, big time, yeah. I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi it's called Reginald Pooftah. Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you? - Michael Scott. - Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called ho me [Bleep]. That's what it sounds like. [Laughing] - Herrow! Herrow! - I do ping. Herrow. I ping. You can't do that these days. You can't. No, no, no. And people don't understand that it has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality. No, no, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [Laughing] Ohh! That's good. Pleasure to meet you. - Where are you working? - Dunder Mifflin. - Any jobs now? - No, not right now. - Just let me know. - All right. All right. See ya around. - Bye-bye. What a nice guy. [Elevator bell dings] [Cheerful music] [Door opens] Your first student is here, mister Bernard. That's actually "master of ceremonies" Bernard. Last year, I went to a seminar called "the ten secrets of real estate." Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, I'm spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients. Oh, it's [door closes] [Gruff, accented voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar. Michael? Neii'm Greek! My name is Mikanos. Ooh. Ohh. [Snickers] Wait, Michael? Michael? Okay. I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character, Mikanos, is just a little added Flava. Mikanos is loosely based on another character I do, Spiros, who is more about the ladies. Thank you so much, tuna Turner. You are simply the best. Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win. Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous. Wow. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be a part of this seminar. No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy. - I know. - If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You, like, signal the flavors of the whole night. I'm really sorry. I can't do it you can't. You can't. I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck, because this is the only job I've ever been good at. [Slaps desk] Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over? What's going on? Do you know that guy? I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. Hey. How are the marks? What are some of your small business ideas? I was thinking we could buy up a bunch of abandoned mineshafts. All: Oh. That's great. There's a big, big future in that. A lot of mines in Scranton. Um, what about you? - Uh, credit cards. - Uh-huh. My company will act as an intermedium for, like, 0.2 cents off every transaction. Wow! Or something with cell phones, like, every time you make a phone call, I'd make 0.2 cents. Or anything like, any online shopping, I get .2 cents basically. Right. Okay? Okay. Great. You promised us whales. These are worms. They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales, which is even cuter. I'm out. Stanley, you're supposed to close. I'm out, too. What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are supposed to help each other out. We're supposed to be a team. We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team. You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking, you know Andy's having a seminar today? What if we went in as a Greek couple? Mikanos and Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that. Okay. Holly broke up with a.J. Last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened To me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in High School when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But you know what? Here I am using it. [As mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to mikanos? Is mikanos Greek? He sounds Italian. Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today. Maybe mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus. Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that. [Muttering] DownThere. Is "JLP" a word? - "Jelp"? J-e-l-p? - No, j-l-p. Like, "I JLP I JLP you!" I don't think that's a word. I'm playing scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game. The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen the shining, Rosemary's baby, the ring. Not really my thing. Although, I I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything. You want some help? Really? - Mm-hmm. Yes. - K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean? It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"? Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo," I'm playing "milk, whatever it takes. Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood." Would have played a Uh! A triple word. Like the cow mood yesterday. God. Or moon. The cow jumped over the moon. No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right? Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm-up guy. Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam. Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great. Then I won't let you down. - Cake. - In you go. Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right? - Yeah. - I need someone to talk to this seminar about business. - And? - Can you do it? Okay. I don't I don't like committing to things just like that. So no? No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment. Oh, baby. What do I put you down for, bro hombre? Yes. - All right! - Yes, I'll do it. Okay, thank you so much. It's gonna be awesome. - And if I flake, I flake. - What? Kevin, you open it up. Yep. Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then creed, guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two, three! - Go. - Creed! Ha! Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name's Andy Bernard, but you can call me the nard dog. Hi, nard dog. I'm Lu Peachem. Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the dunder Mifflin business experts? [Clapping] Good. Well, as you can see on your program, first up is a speech called, "don't just dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [On cd player] All aboard! Ha ha ha ha ha! [Ozzy Osbourne's crazy train]  Ay  [Echoing]   Three, four, five. [Electric guitar intro]   [Slaps blinds] Yes! There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type. [Out of breath] DreamBig. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you cAn. [Coughing] And then double it! [Coughing] Are you okay? No. Yes! - Here. - N I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [Coughing] [Vomiting] Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way. [Vomiting] I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last but perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend. What are you who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch. It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in the works. The business bitch, the diet bitch, the shopping bitch, the etiquette bitch. I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale university adjunct Professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my BlackBerry. [Phone line rings] It's ringing. Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise. Professor Powell, you are on speakerphone. Uh, why? Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business? Um, there aren't really ten secrets. Come on, Scott, please. It's me. Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline. - Mm-hmm. That brilliant little bitch. A little treat for our old friend, Gabe. Put that "q" right there. Wait. Why? Put the "q" there, sweetie. - I think there's better - Put the "q" there! [Phone chimes] Sorry I yelled. You could have just told us what you were thinking. There's no theater in that. There's no yelling in that, either. Well What do you do in your free time? [As mikanos] Practice Olympics. Mmm. Do you like movies? I like the musical grease, or as we call it "home." We have to try this out on somebody. [Both laughing] Hello. Look, you want to order something? She will have a greekaccino. I don't know what that is. It [with accent] It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat. - [Laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk! No more brain damage. No more brain damage! Ahh! I don't know. Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is Creed Bratton. [Applause] Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the loch ness monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here? [Clapping] Okay! All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There's sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour. I picked out our movie. It's called suspiria. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down. - When I win - Ooh. - We're gonna watch wall-e, where all the boundaries of color are pushed. It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some slumdog millionaire scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible. So what's your crazy business pipe dream? Well, I started my own golf supply company. Really? It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth. - [Quietly] Phyllis? - Hmm? Some of these people are for real. Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you. Thank you. Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, buddy. Huh? Really? Ahem! - Excuse me. - I got it. I got it. Hey, do you need a lozenge? [Whispering] They're a bunch a jackals. What? They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home. Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture. Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on? [Whispering] You're gonna blow it. Maybe. Only maybe. I got it. [All laughing] Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself. Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes. Yes. Ah! No [laughing] Although I must say, I will have apoplexy if you lose. Do you understand? Apoplexy is what I will have. Apoplexy. - Yes. - Got it. [Phone plays losing sound effects] Oh, Oscar. Oscar? I played "ape." I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season. Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so [As mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. [Normal voice] All right, you have to close right now. Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it. No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it. Yeah, yeah. Andy, what's the problem? This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy. You know, Kelly and creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [As mikanos] What is taking that guy so long? Psst. [Taps on door] You think this thing's gonna go much longer? I don't know. They're still in there. - Ohh! Good-bye. Stop. Out with it. Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, tom. Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually. And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group. I was blue group, so it was second from the top. - And tom - Was in green group. And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she thought that they would be a good influence. And that's what I told him. Right. But how'd you say it? "My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with." Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now? I'll take one. Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? Sold! Anybody else? Yes! All right! - Yeah, bitch. - Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decisions of your life. [Quietly] No, no, no. But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime. Whoo! Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda? Yeah. Whoa. [Deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead. Hey. Hey. How's it goin'? - Pretty good. - It's been a while. It has been, yeah. So you work here, huh? Sales. Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory. [Laughs] 'Cause you're so smart. Oh, man. You remember that, huh? Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius. - All right, good catch-up. - Yeah. - See ya. Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg? Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya. Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't know how you missed 'em. [With accent] Wonderful seminar! [As mikanos] Almost as good as the day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on. Michael, I should get back to work. What? Come on. It's time for grapes. Real fun day. - So, I won. - I know. You get to pick. Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch wall-e. Yes? So I got us a compromise. This movie is called hardware, it tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like wall-e that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like. I heard you talked about movies before  there's a Shrek 2? Oh, yeah. Nice guy.

Hey. How are you doing? Been thinking about my grandmother a lot. Yeah. She was about to turn 97. At least she lived a very long and I'm sure very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready, we all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you. Thank you. "Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted. "Have fun today, big guy. "Aww, yeah. Party time." It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday. "Hooray. Live it up, big d. "Days like this don't come often enough. "Time to celebrate. You deserve this"? Birthday punches! I'm so sorry. So I got an early res at blue wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work. Rachel from the party? Oh, yeah. Nice. Do the damn thing. Pow! Blue wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. - I'll miss you. - Miss you. - Mwah. - Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me. Mwah. Bye. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - All right, bye. Bye. - Bye. Okay, one more quick one. Don't go. I don't want you to go. - Oh, don't go. - Mwah. Don't go. Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you. And what do we have here? From my secret admirer. That's you. Come on. I dominate Valentine's day. I practically make romance into a science. "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt. Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow the clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck. But there's no clue. Well, get to work. I can't, 'cause there's no clue. The puzzle is the clue. Are these numbers correct? The numbers are correct, Michael. Okay. Are you are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out. I just need a signature. There you go. Thanks. Thank you. How much did you give him? - Big tip. - Wait. I don't have my scarf. What? I'm missing my scarf. We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing. - Yeah, lunch was wonderful! - Shh. Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondueStation. And what else was there? Um, bottomless champagne. Yes. Never found that bottom, did we? No. What's up? Are you good at jigsaw puzzles? Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing. Okay. But if this is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends. Well, okay then. Yes! At least until Stanley calms down. - Oh, is he - D-d-d-d-d-don't look. I accidentally did his sudoku. Andy. All right. I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. Okay, my name is j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p-p-p-p-pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. Wait. You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine. Aww, nuts. I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong I love Michael and Holly. And maybe I'm being overly sensitive But the PDA. Yes! The freaking PDA! - Uh-huh. - Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them. No one is more thrilled for them than I am Yes. Yes, absolutely. But it's totally inappropriate. Yeah, it's a little much. Obviously so happy for them both. So happy. Yeah. I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because - No, stop. Just don't. - Kevin! Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny. God! Kevin! So tell me about your new girlfriend. She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there. Aww, cute. Hey, look at that. Done. That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it. I wish you well on your quest. - No, come on. - Aww, I mean come on! - Okay. - Ha! I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just Like it's coming from my own head. Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. Ohh. Can you get lower? - Oh, yeah. - A little lower. I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head. Thank you all for meeting on such short notice. Yes? Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting? Seeing as it's Valentine's day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace. Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on. First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate? Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances. Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting. Uh, I also don't see Andy. Boom! Face! I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam. Yeah? What? Us? They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. - Did it. - Yeah! Love it. Keep going. Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, Booby honking. Yeah, booby honking. Sure. Butt honking. Butt honking. Yeah, all the honkings. The one where you start in a crouched position, then you leap Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Are you guys listening to this? What, are you talking about me and Holly? Yeah! Maybe you find your own chair. So we kiss occasionally Occasionally? All the time. Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering. The flirtatious tickling. Whispering and tickling have their place in business. That thing where you softly exhale on her neck. Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. Michael. I have done PDA in the office. Thank you. I've had intercourse in the office. - All right. - As has Angela. - Dwight. - As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has creed. As has Michael. And as has Holly. As has Kevin. With who? She goes to another school. Okay. Fine. No more PDA. - Good. - You win. But here's what we are gonna do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. - No. - Anything goes. Just leave it how you said Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes? - And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? - Pro. - Yes. What? Problem solved. No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises. That is weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right? You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him. Don't mind us. You keep working. Okay. I'll keep working. Oh, my God. It's a song. What do you think is on it? We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad. Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us. I think he's just being nice. That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level. Darryl. Darryl is a jerk. - No, he's not. - No, I'm just testing if he can hear. I can hear you. - Oh. Okay. - Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.  The temp at night   the temp at night   the temp at night   the temp at night  Temp at night? What do you you got it. Pick it up. Take it out. Pi - pick it up. - Okay. Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out. Right. Okay. Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things. Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working. Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable. Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable. Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop. Okay. Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart. Hey. You know the only reason why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's day. Two people in love? I love you. Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, "oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl," or do you mean you love me like you love me-love me? - I love you-love you. - Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. I love you. Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me. Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night? I guess we just have to wait until night and see. Oh. Or maybe not. Cool. - How romantic is this? - Super romantic. Right? Do you see a clue or Yeah. Did you not see it? - Oh, my gosh. - Hanks. Hey. No time to chat. - Sorry. - Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here. Hey. You're looking for me? Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey. - No, you weren't. - No, we weren't. You wanted to have sex in my office. - No. - Definitely not. That's disgusting. It's cool. Just try to put everything back where you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here. Hey, you don't have to That was so embarrassing I'm gonna die. That was really rough. Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office. No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place. Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed. And a shower. - Hello, Holly. - Hello. Here, shake no! - No, don't touch. - No, we can't. - No touching. - No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you. - Almost got you. - Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh. You're not touching me. I don't know what your body feels like. 'Cause I can't touch it. Okay, this is much worse than before. Yeah, I agree. This is nasty. - Grab you here. - And here. And I will grab you here anyway. You have to cut it out. - Never. - Okay. You said you would. I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't know what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not and frankly cannot be contained. No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. You're taking MDMA street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling. No. I don't think so. You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to nashua. You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior. Yes, it was that. It's that one. Yes. Number three. Give me all your money and take off your clothes. We're not supposed to PDA. Come on. Nobody's looking. What's wrong? I hadn't thought about you having to go back to nashua. Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance. That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different? We weren't in love last time. I was in love with you. I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said. One Erin special, please. Here's your bottle of sparkling cider. That's my favorite. I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mid-hunt break and look for a heart or some [Bleep] In the break room when you're through. Hey, buck up, buddy. Make that face he likes. Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him. It's like a time bomb - Shh. - Is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging. Just hush. Sexual time bomb. Just rock. Shh. Boner bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera. - Movie idea? - No. Saving the world has never been this hard. Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about our feelings? Women really go for that crap. No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending. Kevin. Do more stupid faces. Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces. - I don't know. - Do the monkey face. - Do a monkey face. - I love that. I love that face. Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down. - No. The monkey! - Go back to the monkey. Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop. Hurl your feces. That's good. - Good. - That's good. He's throwing it. They really do that. I know. - B-9. - B-9. Like benign tumor. Maybe it's just more like, "be mine." Oh, yes. There's a note. "A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss." Oh. We're supposed to Holly. Hey. - Hi. - Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think that we need to break up. What? What are you talking about? Actually it's Valentine's day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow. No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me. You're gonna go back to nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just let's what if I said it wasn't up to them? - Who? - The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me. Okay. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving in together. Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend. Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up. Better luck next time, pal. Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu. - You do? - I do. Go on. Kiss each other already. Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you. I just told them to do it. - What? - No. No. We took a walk. We took a walk. My perfect Valentine's day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago. Anybody can be prince charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year. Flowers, diamonds, three course meal Violinist comes to my table to serenate me Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with What are our plans for tonight?
I got a delivery for you. Leave it at reception. I'm supposed to deliver this one in person. Clean up on aisle five. After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of reshooting, and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level Midnight. [Cheerful music] - Erin, Erin - Yes? - What are you doing? - Guys Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it? That's Well, don't put words in my mouth. Threat Level Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott. We're all in it, from, like, years and years ago. It's like a home movie. Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie. Michael screened a work in progress for us years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. Everything pointed to it being a comedy. - Yep. - We'd love to see it. Sweet. I will go invite Holly. Okay, everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive. So let's stay positive And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy, and we'll have a pure fun day, okay? Thanks, mom. You never told me you made a movie. Mm-hmm. It's got action. It's got heart. It's got symbolism. - It's got you. - It's got a lot of me. I can't wait. Ladies and gentlemen, Threat Level Midnight. [Upbeat dramatic music, cheers and applause]   Michael Scarn? Well, that is an interesting story. He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story. Master Scarn. Master Scarn! I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice [Robotic voice] To be like this. But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advanced android, almost indistinguishable from a real person. Dwight does not play a robot. - I'm up. - It's the president. - He needs you for a mission. - Tell him I'm retired. It's Goldenface. Goldenface This makes it personal. [Dramatic music]   Scarn, you're right on time. [Cheers and applause] - Hail to the chief. - I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it would be good for my daughter to see a black man as president, even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time. It's your old enemy, Goldenface. He's after the NHL all-star game. He's hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn This one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can't see it blown up. It's my retirement plan. We have to search the stadium. Not so fast Goldenface has taken all of the concession-stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages and save the game? Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven. Heads. [Dramatic music] Tails.   Heads. Tails. Heads. Tails. Looks like there's gonna be a clean up on aisle five. [Cheers and applause] Well, the hostages were scared. Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us. Oh, someone's coming, all right. The only man who would care, Michael Scarn. [Cheers and applause] See, I'm gonna lure him here. Then I'm gonna kill everybody. Then I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good. [Laughing evilly] I did not love the dialogue Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless. Well, the all-star game was three days away. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer, Cherokee Jack. Mop the ice. I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey. Mop it. [Inspirational rock music]  Oh   I get no traction 'cause I'm running on ice   it's taking me twice as long   can't have a reaction 'cause I'm running on ice  Come on. Come on.    You got to run, run, run, oh   oh-oh-oh-oh-oh   you run, you run, you run, run, run, oh   oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  - Now take this. -  Running on ice  What am I supposed to do with this? -  Running on ice  - Mop.  Running, running on ice   running on ice  Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country. Each year the national hockey league accepts one civilian amateur to play in the all-star game. It's down to the three of you. The final test is speed skating. On your marks Get set Die. [Gunshot] [Dramatic music]   [Breathing heavily] Nice try, Goldenface, except you forgot one thing to kill me. Oh, I wasn't trying to kill you. I was trying to slow you down. No! - Oh, by the way - Yeah? How's your wife doing? [Laughing evilly] Congratulations. Hey, you came in second Not bad either, champ. I'm so sorry I have to do this. Shh! Shh, shh! [Choking] [Grunts] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm intercepting a name Jasmine Windsong. She works for Goldenface. But what I can't figure out is, who is the Funky Cat? Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest jazz club in town. Oh! Oh, n [jazz music]   He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned? Then what was the point of spilling the drink on me?  They call me   Jasmine Windsong  Bingo. He finished his movie? No kidding. Wow. That's great. Yeah, good for him. [Singing unintelligibly]   [Click]  The hostages are under the stadium  Ooh, ugh! [Choking] [All murmur] Ugh. Check, please. You have to let us go, Goldenface. - We have families. - Ha, this is gonna show them That I mean business. See ya. Far and away the most expensive shot of the movie, but it was "intregral" to the story. Ha! It's Scarn! Sorry about your friend, Scarn. The joke's on you, Goldenface. That man was a wanted animal rapist. We've searched the whole building, Goldenface. - Where is the bomb? - Hmm? We've searched the whole building, Goldenface. - Where is the bomb? - Hmm? We've searched the Okay. He said, "Where is the bomb?" In the puck. But why are you telling me this? Because I'm going to kill you, unless You forgive me for murdering your wife. [Soft emotional music]   - Hey, Goldenface. - Yeah? Go puck yourself. No! That was not scripted. [Gun cocks] [Gasps] [Gunshot] [Soft emotional music] [Weakly] More Tylenol. You've already had four. Oh, God! So good. You're lucky to be alive. It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn. Let's just make sure that everything's working properly. [Monitor beeping slowly] [Beeping quickens] You just said the bomb is in the puck? Both: Yes. Is that where you hid the bomb, Goldenface? But why would you blow up the stadium? You own the stadium. For the insurance money I knew it all along. You will never get away with this. [Chuckles evilly] [Gunfire] Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up. It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he'd lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't, of course. He just wasn't using it right now. All: Mike! Beer me, Billy. You don't look so good. What's got you down? I got problems, Billy, big problems. You got problems? My TV don't work. I pay 30 bucks a month for the damn satellite "Whatsahoozit." I can't even get the damn game. Now, you tell me, what's worse than that? [Chuckles] Don't ever change, Billy. [Chuckles] Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL all-star game tomorrow. I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink. All: Hey. Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby? Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later? I'm too depressed to save the big game, Billy. I'm gonna cheer you up the only ways I know hows. Hey, kid Hit G-9 on the jukebox. No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died. There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do the Scarn. [Funky music]    Well, my name's Michael Scarn   and I'm here to say   I'm about to do the Scarn in a major way     you jump to the right, and you shake a hand   then you jump to the left, and you shake that hand   you meet new friends, you tie some yarn   and that's how you do the Scarn  All:  You jump to the right, and you shake a hand   then you jump to the left, and you shake that hand   meet new friends, tie that yarn   that's how you do the Scarn   you jump to the right and  [Chuckles] Shh. Stop. All:  And you shake that hand   meet new friends, tie that yarn  -  that's how you do the Scarn  - Boom! If doing the Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on earth! - [Laughs, snorts] - You guys, I think I have - I'm really sorry. - My self-confidence back. [All cheering, video pauses] - Hey, hey. - Michael! Michael, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back. Yeah, Michael, the movie's amazing. It's, like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. You should enter it in festivals. - Or carnivals. - Yeah. Well, that's a pretty good reaction. That's pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that? Which part? Okay. - All right. - Oh, come on. No. All: Michael. - No, come on! - We have to see the end. No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough. Some people are really popping on-screen. - Hey. - Hey. - Good movie. - Mm, good? Everybody out there says it's great. - I loved it. - Did you? - What did you love about it? - Um I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. - Mm-hmm. - Isn't that so great when you can all work together like that? No, no. Holly, this isn't Oean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends, and you just have fun, and you don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly? Um Is it is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? Because, see, I need you to keep me grounded. I'm not worried about that. This is 11 years, okay? This has been my dream for 11 years And if you don't think it's great, then you're basically saying you don't believe in my dream. It's your dream? You never even mentioned it before. We talk about a lot of things, Holly. You know, I was eventually going to get around to my dream, obviously. that I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus. Well, why do you have to make a movie at all? Because if I don't have this, what do I have? - I have nothing. - Really? You can't think of anything else that you might have? I have my book on business, somehow I manage. I have my HBO Comedy Special, here I go again, dot, dot, dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie. I'm real. Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And now I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great. And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass. I'm angry, and I love you. I love you too. I'm a huge Woody Allen fan Although I've only seen Antz. But I'll tell you something What I respect about that man is that when he was going through all of that stuff that came out in the press About how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films Or at least the film that I saw, which, again, was Antz. Thing is I thought Bug's Life was better, much better than Antz. Point is, don't listen to your critics. Listen to your fans. Who likes Threat Level Midnight? [Cheers and applause] Okay, well, then who wants to watch the rest? [Cheers and applause] [Dramatic music] Michael, you have to get to that puck before halftime, or the whole stadium will explode. I know. It's a good thing my trainer and mentor - is here to cheer me on. - Cherokee Jack? Michael, he died. [Sad music]   This one's for you, Cherokee Jack. We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School hockey game. They were trying to qualify for States. Shh. It's fine. It's great. No, no, actually it was really screwed up, because they they were trying to qualify. They were disqualified. They had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season That's why there were so many people there. [Sad music] - Why is your face gold? - Why do you care? I'm just making conversation. I worked in a gold factory. We had a boss who only cared about money. He wouldn't give us lunch breaks, so we had to - Hey. - Hey, I'm sorry. - It is good. - No, no, it's not. It's not. But they really seem to be enjoying it. - [Laughs] - Come on. Please, Goldenface, let us go! [Dramatic music] Cherokee Jack. I want you to take all your frustrations with women, the system, with everything take it out on the puck, all on the puck. [Laughing] [Dramatic music]   [Laughing] - Yah! - Aah! - Oh! - Yay! - Yay, they're saved! - Whoo!   Hey, we got sports games again. [All cheering] [Laughing] Oh, sh [explosion] [Cheers and applause] Some breakfast for me, some breakfast for you. [Laughter] Aw. Oh, yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot. [Phone rings] I'll get it. Man, I love being retired. Scarn here. - Michael, it's the president. - Hello, sir. I need you for another mission. Uh Yeah, I'm in. [Cheers and applause] Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Isn't the president evil? Oh, yeah. [Laughs] Yes, he is. No, no, he's doing it to catch the president. No, no, Dwight, he's just being stupid. [Laughter] Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn? Well, because I am Michael Scarn. All: Oh! [Applause] That was so good. [Groovy music] Aw, yeah!
I have the best stock survival shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything is a life. So I must eat and then replace everything that is about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals. You're eating eight-year-old tomatoes. They're still good for another week. You know, I think I might have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. I've got some cheese you might like too In between my toes. Hardy-har-har. All right, picture this. Snowy Ash drizzles from the sky. A rabid pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you the door to my shelter. You pound. You beg. "Dwight, please let me in." But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You want to know why? Because of the sign that says, "no pounding. No begging." No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten. Pam will be taken slave. Jim will be made a warlord's Jester. Meredith will do okay. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months. Three months. - Could be. - Four months. I could see that happening, yes. Eight months? That's a realistic timeline. Perhaps. Okay, wait, now really think hard about this one. One year. I could see that as a very real possibility. I could see that happening. That's just I really thought I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses. Still not seeing the problem there. All right. Truth is, I got a couple love bumps on my ding-dong, so I was like, "oh, game over." It was the best of times. It was the "awesomest" of times. And now packer wants to come home. And, oh, look who's here to sign off on it my boo, Holly. Hi. Hi. You must be Todd. Whoa, I'm sorry. Michael, I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston. Very funny. Okay, let's get started. After you. Okay. Oh, Michael, this'll be just us. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him, like, five shots. - Okay. - And it also helps if you've had five shots. I already have. Why is packer back? Oh, is packer here? Why is he talking to Holly? Don't know, don't care. Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves. So Oh! Yes! The pack is back. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding. He wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd packer is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you now to welcome him with open arms. Yes! What? It's great to be among friends. And until then, you suckers will do. Nice. We got burned. You did. You got burned, because packer's back. Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms for a condominium, although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out. Holly You approved this? Yes, I did. I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff. - You did approve it? - Yeah. What don't you understand about the word "approved"? It seems a couple of you don't know what the word "approved" means. I have very little patience for stupidity. Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower. Such a klutz. Yeah, and it took the fire department forever to get there. Oh, my God. Where did this come from? Who did this? I got Erin a new computer because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't want to say the other one was old, but its I.P. Number was one. Right? Thank you, Pam. Aw, you're welcome. My pleasure. Can I do something for you? I just helped someone out. It feels good. Nice. You know, I cleaned up our daughter for, like, an hour at 4:00 A.M. This morning, so So you know the feeling. Special delivery for Dwight k. Schrute. I didn't order anything. And I don't have anything for you. But I do want to talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where packer should sit, and we can't just sit around waiting for creed to die. Well, there's a lot of seats in the annex. So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating so that packer can take this desk here. Thanks, man. It would mean a lot to me. I've been sitting here for ten years, Michael. Well, I was there for 12 years. Plus, my name's carved under the desk. - No, it is not. - It is too. - Where? - Right there. Check it out. Michael, I don't want to move desks. Don't be a baby. We're okay, there it is. "Packer was here and so was your mom." - Yeah. - Do I have any say in this? No! It's $20 to watch, Halpert. Oh. Hey. Whose dirt box is this? That's our zen garden. What do you grow in here, bull crap? Hey, Holly. Hey. What's up, guys? Don't "what's up?" Us. You think you're so cute with your pretty blond hair. Whoa, whoa. Pull it back. Um, why did you hire Todd packer? He's seriously awful. Michael's recommendation was glowing. Honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me. That's how he gets you to take off your panties. - Why are you nodding? - United front. Okay, look, we can't fire someone because we don't like him. Right. This isn't the U.S. government. What are you referencing? Everything. Everything. Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done? Well, I mean, he humped Michael. Well, if that's the case, I guess I've got to be fired too. Hey. Hey, you guys. The yarmouth regatta video is up. Gather round. Check it out. This guy's on a full beam reach. They're hiking out like mad. Luff him up. Luff him up. Nice ah! This computer's a hunk of junk. Hey, sailor, come watch your regatta over here. Where did you get this? Pam gave it to me. This is a sick computer. Gwen Stefani has this computer. Uh, Pamela. Yep? What does a guy have to do to whom to get one of them? You have a computer, Andy. Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become famous as the slowest computer in Africa. Okay, listen, we just don't have the budget for it, okay? Reception needed a computer, so we got one. Well, Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kind of a coincidence that I work there, but Yes, but reception is a one-person department. If I get you a new computer, I have to get one for everyone in sales for Dwight, for Stanley. It would be crazy. So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now. They're not asking for one. I am. I-I need it. If you're just handing them out, I want one too. Phyllis, nobody's handing anything out. See, that's what I'm talking about. What, are you gonna play mah-jongg faster? I'm sorry, Andy. Hey, what's going on, you guys? Yeah. Three muske-queers. Mean, but good. So, Todd, this must be nice for you, getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter. I don't know. I love her and all, but she's turned into a bitch. Most days she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. Well, some girls go through a phase. Yeah. Your life is so insane. You should write a book. Since when did you learn how to read? I do know how to read, though. Yeah. You know how to read a menu. This guy. I He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight. Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up-and-comer. What the heck? Why do you have Erin's computer? It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched. What? Erin, is that true? I just thought he seemed to really need a new computer, and he knows so much about that one. Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception, okay? It's not yours to give away. Pam. When I'm freaking out, I just sort of step back, take three deep breaths. I'm not freaking out. Okay? And then I ask myself, "is this worth freaking out about?" Andy, why should she have your crappy computer? Oh, that's interesting. So you also think my computer's crappy. Switch the computers back, Andy. - Seriously? - Seriously. Pam, come on. Now, please. Fine! Please make sure nobody is humping me. Oh, if you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. Thanks. Best day ever. Best day ever. So much is happening. Oh. Question should I get stripes shaved into the side of my head? No. No. Please. Did Todd tell you to do that? - Yes. - Yeah. You love him, right? You love him. I can tell. - I love you. - No, no, not me. Him. What? He's certainly opinionated. If you're not gonna take the ants over, I should probably just do it myself. - Oh, I'm going. - Whoa, no. Are you jealous of him Because you think he's funnier than you? Honey. I don't think he's funnier than me. Oh, he's funnier than me. He's not funny at all. So I'm less funny than not funny at all? Uh-oh, I think the ants are starting to eat each other. No, what I'm saying is he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is. Um Okay, bill cosby, Steve Martin, Charlie bit my finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here, Todd packer. That's insane. Honey, he's a jerk. Oh, for Pete's sake, it just needs to be done. So you two are married now, right? - Yeah. - That's sweet. How's the sex? - Yeah. - Hey, packer I made you some hot chocolate. Why? 'Cause I want to let bygones be bygones, show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot-chocolate recipe from my wife. That's a lot of reasons. Drink it. I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Vivica A. Fox. Can I talk to you for a second? - Here. - Okay. Okay. So this hot-chocolate thing with packer None of your business. Well, you know you can't actually poison him. Right? It isn't poison. It's a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle it. I really think we should join forces on this one. - Really? - What do we think? What would drive him crazy? - I know. - Here we go. Pepto-bismol in his hot chocolate. You have got to stop with the hot-chocolate stuff. Okay. I was thinking maybe we could jam his drawers so that they only come out two inches. Then, that way, you can see everything in them, but you can't get at it. Does Edgar Allen poe know about that one? So sinister. That wouldn't annoy a person at all. Where do you come up with this stuff? All right, well, this isn't my best, but call froggy 101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets. We give 'em a number to call for the tickets, and it's his number. Who is justice beaver? He it's a crime-fighting beaver. Why don't you write up your best 40 ideas and email 'em to me can you do that? Absolutely. I'll email you 100. Yeah. Write up your list of 100, edit it down to your top 40, and I'll read it over. Pam, can I talk to you in private? I don't know if there's really a private place in this office. Well, I put a sign-up sheet in the conference room, and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes, and it started two minutes ago, so You did that? Can we talk about this in the meeting? 'Cause we're already late. Okay. Wow, when did people sign up for that? - Mind if I close the door? - No. What you did out there earlier was totally uncool. Well, what I was supposed to do, huh let you walk all over me? You humiliated me in front of everybody. Okay, well, I didn't think about it like that. It's just I can't do anything about it. I can't replace your computer unless that one breaks. Well, I mean, it's pretty broken already. Well, if it breaks all the way, I can get you a new one. Pretty sneaky, sis. Hey, cats, we got a jam session in mods 6, 9, and 12. There are 400 of these. Yeah, I couldn't cut it down. They're all good. So good. "Number three eat a frog." That sounds promising. "Number four eat a dog." I don't know, um, from a practical standpoint Did you like 135? "Eat a brog." Maybe it's 'cause I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes. Let me grab a pen and Damn it. Ah, just when we were just when we were getting going. Allow all cookies? Why, "soitenly." Pop-ups? Yes, please. Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah, why not? Oh, I hope you don't get sick, Mr. computer. Why are you doing this to me, Andy? Because I hate your broke ass. And a 76ers fan to boot. I like that. And you made Hank smile. That doesn't happen often. You're very charming. You know what? That is something that you should take upstairs and use on the people that really matter. - Why? - I don't know. Holly mentioned that there were some complaints and that you had said some things about Kevin. - Holly said that? - Yeah. She was laughing hysterically the whole time. I guess you said something weird about your daughter. She asked me, Michael. It would have been rude not to answer. You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls. Michael, can I open the kimono with you? I've been on the road too long. But I want to connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers. No, it isn't. You're right. I got to I got to watch my behavior. Yeah, a little bit. Don't give up on me. I won't. Okay. Everybody? I need you to see this, because maybe there is somebody here that you underestimated who will surprise you. Todd packer is going to apologize. Kevin, front and center come here. I got a lot of numbers here to put together. Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face. We know that you are hurt and embarrassed. That's silly. I should be apologizing to packer, 'cause everybody knows that I can dish it as good as I can take it. Okay, sweetie, no, you shouldn't be apologizing to packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? Are you ready for this? - Mm-hmm. Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier. Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show. Kevin, do you accept the apology? Don't do it, Kevin. That's that fake kind of apology. - Okay, go back to the annex. - This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time, like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it, Kevin. Sometimes you overreact. Michael, how is this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-ass apologies, and we're back to square one. Okay. You want an apology? Here goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you're a genius. That that was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce, Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parents' expectations, Andy. Angela loves pussycats. Packers loves - No, don't. - I was going to say "dogs"! Okay, you know what? This is over. Apology has been issued, and we're through with it. Packer's going to be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us. So, listen, we have to really scuff this up. No, no, no, we can say that the previous owner was a neat freak or an elegant old lady, and she just kept it around in case her grandkids came to visit. But they died, and they never came. I'm gonna make myself cry. Andy, this is the deal we made. That's probably good. That's enough. We should break this hinge maybe. Let's not go crazy. Well, thanks. Will do. Absolutely. Now, when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful, so she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is, go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. That sounds weird. It is weird. Look at you perceptive. Now I know why jo has kept her eye on you. And you make sure to get down there and check out the Harry Potter world. Whatever you want to do in your spare time is up to you. Harry Potter world is supposed to be fantastic. Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every subspecies. Also, I'm a huge boob nerd. Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt, and we'll get you back. What are you doing? Shh, this is a very important client. All right, so just pack your bags. And, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks. Bye, now. Bye. I cannot believe this. You're sending packer to Florida? Why? Because he's a jerk. - You gave him my desk. - Okay. So you're tricking him into flying to Florida. This wasn't my first choice. Jim had so many better ideas. You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did. No, no, no, no, no, no. That that is not in the plan. That is actually anti what we're doing. He is my oldest friend. I am going to tell him. Wait. Why don't we come up with a plan that we're all happy about? Yeah, that Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer? Come on, Andy. I mean, you said you wanted a computer this is the best I could do. Where'd you even find this thing like, in the corner of the warehouse? Yes, I found it on a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. All right, well, thank you for my garbage computer. You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the "ass" in Tallahassee. Yes, about that Oh, man, we got to go out and celebrate tonight. Well, I don't know if that's a good idea. - The old ball and chain? - No. No. Nothing like that at all. Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend. She's uptight. Sorry? I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is, in about a month or so, have you down to Florida, introduce you to all the local talent. Sounds great. Yeah. It's gonna be so good. That is. It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there. I'm sorry about your friend. No. He's an ass. You are. You are. What are you, wicked smaht? No, you are. Saw Andy's new computer you found in the warehouse. Yep. Lucked out. Yeah, you really did, 'cause I know every inch of that warehouse. Yep. Super lucky. Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days. Yeah. You know what? I think I saw one sick day I think maybe I saw five. Three. I'm full on corrupt.
Race fan, huh? No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts. Oh. Dunder Mifflin is having our first ever garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we didn't really need. And $.10 of every dollar is going into the party fund, so we can throw parties for ourselves. People, look alive! It's showtime! Doors open in three Two One! [Door buzzer] [Applause] Ooh, yikes. It's cold, Dwight! Just shut the door. Let people come in the front. It's good that it's cold. It'll drive business inside. The signs will drive business inside. The warmth will lure people inside. - Close it. - This is how business I'm not closing the doo Close it. No. Stop it. Just stop. Kevin, shut the door. [Cheerful music] Uh-oh. Looks like someone's sign's a little crooked. Ugh. It looks awful. You need a thumbtack? - Sure. - Not so fast. Schrutes are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here. I will trade you for the used candle. Forget you. Come on. It's trash, like your sign, unless you have this. Fine. Just give it. That's how it's done. Whoa. I love her. How much for that? I, uh I actually don't know why I brought that, because it's kind of priceless. $10. Mmm, no. I paid $500 for that. - 200. - 500. - 20. - 45. - Get lost. - Damn it. And that is how you do it. You know, we don't have to sell that if you don't want. If it's a problem with the neon, I can have my neon guy take a look. No, you know, it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price. Well, we could put it in storage in case. In case? In case of what? Well, you know, in case Maybe something changes. I don't have an "in case." Do you have an "in case"? No. How much for the slip n' slide? Get lost. Yes, hello, Mr. flax. This is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly, because she's such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. [Laughs] I'm kidding. I'm actually calling Because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you, which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping that you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back when you get this, and I look forward to speaking. Thank you. Mmm. Are you serious? A half-used candle? Get out of here, Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body. Oh, 'cause there's a huge line of people who want your spinster tchotchkes. Screw you, man. People like my stuff. People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over, and you're, like, "hey, baby, let me light a candle," and you pull out this one. Half-used. He's like, "who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast." You can take my Helen fielding collection. And the Jennifer Weiner collection. Oh, my gosh. You have the Dallas board game? Yeah. When I was a kid, I was on Dallas. - Really? - Yeah. We missed our connecting flight, and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii. I was on heaven. We should play it. Well, there's no instructions. It's Dallas, the game. We can figure it out. Yeah. I'm pretty good at board games. Well, shall we make it a little interesting? Sure. What is this? How did those get out? I'm sorry. "Professor Copperfield's miracle legumes"? I was in Jamaica, and I got lost. And it was getting dark this one night, and then out of nowhere, this guy comes with a cart, and he's selling these. Dwight, he told me things about myself that there's no way he could have known. That's a common swindler's trick. Probably. Probably. So I buy some. I turn the corner. I feel like an idiot. So I go back to get my money. He was gone. So you want to sell me magic beans? [Laughs] Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's miracle legumes. Nice try. No, correction. Terrible try. Michael called dad? Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on? Um, I think I know, but I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong. Uh, is dad there? - Hollis? - Hi, dad. There was a program on tv about India. Oh, okay. Um, did you connect with Michael? You want to watch it? I I'm not there, dad. I'm in Pennsylvania. What what are you doing there? I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael? I'll I'll put your mother on. No, no, no, dad. Holly? Mom, dad can't seem to focus on the subject. Don't you worry about him. He's got me. Well, who do you have? I have your father. He's right here. I'll put him on. No, mom. Oh, which one's decaf? Michael! Michael! Hey! - Hi. - Hi. I'm just coming out to see what you're doing and maybe stop you. Oh, you know what? Do you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas. Why do you need more gas? Well, I'm Writing a message. Is it a good message or a bad message? I'm asking Holly a question in fire. Are you proposing? Maybe. [Gasps] - Oh! - Wow. You know what? I've got gas on my hands and my shoes. Would you would you light it? Do the honors, please? Yeah. Yeah, no problem. - Pam? - Yep? Could you light this, please? Michael, you've had two ideas today And one of them was great, and the other one was terrible. I am not in the mood for riddles, Pam. This is terrible. No, this is romantic. You know what? I'm gonna get a hose, and then we'll talk about it. Okay? We'll figure it out. I'll be right back. Just stay there. Free sample? My mom makes the best Pesto in the world. And I always tell her, "mom, you should sell this. You'd make a fortune." And she always says, "no, it's just for family." Well, finally, I was like, "fuck it, I'll sell it." So I'm like, "mom, I need you to make a ton of Pesto for a Pesto party for all my friends." She's like, "uh, okay." Pesto party? Really? Anyway, she makes, like, It's so good. And Phyllis just had that "mom" look I wanted. You got this kosher certified? No, I meant like, "it's cool. It's kosher. It's all good." Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [Chuckles] Thank you. What you got there? Oh, it's just Stanley's old photo album. I was thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black man's old photo album sitting on my bookshelf? I'm not James Franco. Things are going very well. I traded a thumbtack for Meredith's junk, for Kelly's crap, for Phyllis's garbage, for Oscar's trash, for Stanley's crap, for Ryan's junk, for creed's garbage, for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have. Jim, put those away. I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out. All right, just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans? They're legumes, Dwight. And you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I? [Scoffs] You know what? This ends now. Hey, Michael. Everyone's in the conference room. Why? You called the meeting. I don't I did? Okay. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you today about Recycling. - Michael? - Yes. We are a family. I could not agree with you more. And I've always believed that we should all be very involved in one another's personal lives in a very major way. - Yes, thank you. - So about this proposal thing. No, no, no, no, no. My mind's made up. I am not going to change my mind. You can't talk me out of it. Michael, she's perfect for you. - She's the one. - She's amazing. This is very exciting. [Chuckles] So we just we want to help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable. I had a great idea until you ruined it. You want to know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner, go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying the ring to a dog's collar, stop and look at yourself. Hmm. [Speaks in texan accent] I'm gon' play me a little old blackmail card Nice. And call a proxy meeting and take control and take control of ewing oil once and for all. No, you can't do that. You can't play a blackmail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn. Why not? Seems to me we're just making up rules 'cause somebody forgot to staple the rule book to the inside of the game like a normal human being. And I'm gonna play this here "share the wealth" card. Ooh! Which entitles me to half of both of you all's money. So if you don't mind no, this card is from the wrong game. This is from the game of life. It was in the box. - Well played. - Thank you. We must honorably adhere to the rules that we are making up on the spot. No, but that's not fair. Well, that's Dallas. Dallas, indeed. What? Ryan, where did you get this picture? My mom also makes the best salsa. This is your mom's old stuff? Yeah, mostly. How's she doing? It didn't go down easy, but she's made some friends, and it's already better than it was. How do you know when it's time? I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent comes to you and says, "I can't take care of myself," it's never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested. Let me see. Okay, I think animals in proposals are out. Right, Ryan? Didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out? Blogs are out, but people are texting each other, "no more animals," yeah. How about this? I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof. It hits the ground, the head pops off. This leads to me saying the line, "I lost my head when I fell in love with you." That's a guarantee. Easy enough to get a corpse. You just go to a med school. I already have the ring. Don't think you need the corpse then. There's the ring. Holy [Bleep]! Is that real? Yeah. They say, "three years' salary." No. Is she not gonna like that? No, she's gonna love it. So I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know, like when Jim proposed, he just he got down on one knee, and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him. And it was perfect. Where was that? At a gas station. [Laughter] A gas station? Well, it was when she was working in New York, so it was halfway between both of us. That must have been a surprise, when, at the gas station, you proposed. No, it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and oh, yeah. You didn't say that the weather was bad. That sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever. Totally reasonable. I'm just it's terrifying. She's not gonna say no. I know, but I'm still scared. I don't know why. 'Cause it's a big deal. I mean, I knew Pam was gonna say yes, but I was still scared. You were scared? Yeah. It's scary. Get this. Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for $200, and I told him, "dude, this was a prop in my movie." Look, I need to talk to you. Okay, it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait till the end of the day. People get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything. I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well. Oh, okay. For how long? I don't know. - Is he all right? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just you know, I just don't want to go home when he's on his deathbed, you know? I want to be there when he's still my dad. Yeah, yeah. Well, you definitely need to do that. And I want you to come with me. Now, I I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend. Okay. And I was thinking, you know, maybe, since given our last conversation, and that we're both ready Michael Scott, will you no, no. Shh! Shu shut it. [Chuckles] Oh, God. Nope, nope, nope. UhWhat? No, I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mm-mmm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance. Hey, guys! It's mu turn. You can't go. You're dead. I shot you five moves ago. Yeah, I told you you can't shoot people. I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. Start having rules now, everything we've built collapses. Well, this is stupid, and I want my money back. Where's the money? Yeah, where is it? Okay, you know what? I am never ever playing games with you two again. And that is Dallas. - Nice. - Not bad, right? I can't really tell. Nice. I know, right? What the oh, my God. That that's impossible. It is, right? I mean, it's impossible. [Sighs] All right, I'll take 'em. - They're probably worthless. - Probably. Leave the telescope. I started with a thumbtack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way, the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No. It was this packet of beans, so I traded the telescope for it. And I can I can just go buy another telescope. Hey. How'd we do? $13. That's great. And we still have most of our stuff. Good. Listen, about earlier no, no, no, no, no. Let's not talk about that. I was wrong to put you in that position. I Michael, you're my life now. I'm not going to Colorado. Shh. You know what? Let's go for a little walk. I want to show you some stuff. So this is one of my favorite places in the world. Why? This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. It was the happiest day of my life Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here. And this is where we first kissed. I remember. And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there? [Whispers] Michael! [Chuckles] Through these blinds is where I first saw you. And you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk When I called you to tell you that I had herpes, and that I was still in love with you. And you said that it was over and that you didn't love me. And thank goodness none of that was true, including the herpes. It was an ingrown hair. Yes. Right in here. This is where we co-ran our first meeting. Remember? Obesity awareness? - Mm-hmm. Saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump. Oh, I say I say I sit on you. [Laughter] And right over there, that's where you realized that Meredith was prostituting herself for outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it. You thought it was so wrong. And over here what happened here? Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here So I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [Chuckles] Nice. Let's go in here. Here? Hi, guys. This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives. Holly, will you marry me? No. Marry me, Holly. No. That guy's got more than he can handle as it is. Will you marry me? No. That marriage would be a sham. - Will you marry me? - No. Easy no. - Will you marry me? - No. That would be hot. I would pay to see that. - Will you marry me, Holly? - No. Only one that I was kind of worried about. This is where I fell in love with you And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with a broken [fire alarm beeping] [Gasps] [Both laughing] - Aah! - Yeah. [Gasps] [Imitating yoda] Holly flax Marrying me will you be? [Imitating yoda] Your wife becoming Be will I. [Laughter] [Cheering] That is so awesome. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Thank you! Thank you. So, guys, guys, guys, guys We're moving to Colorado. All of us? - Yep. - Wait. What? Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
- A sombrero, please? - All right. - So just you tonight? - Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years. I'll drink to that! - I'm starting at a company this week. - Oh, really? To beginnings and endings. And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms. To moms of the troops. Do not tell my fiancee I'm drinking on a Wednesday. I won't. I don't know her. Moving out to the 'burbs. Actually, I'm moving further than the 'burbs. I'm moving to Colorado. - Colorado? - Yeah. - Sunshine state. - Yep. Don't mess with Colorado. No, don't. Doing some skiing? No, no, I don't want to end up like Sonny Bobo. Well, that's just that's just good sense right there. Yeah, everyone I know who skis is dead. You know what, I would like to try the luge though. Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess. That's what I've heard. - I'm an Olympics nut. - Oh, yeah? Me too. Summer or winter? Summer. Knuckle. Actually, I gotta come around to give you yeah, come on. You know, it's funny. I actually tried to get an animal Olympics going. Really? What happened? You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton? Oh, wow. The mountains, where things are. That's the way it goes. Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. No, no, no. Where is this guy? Excuse me. I need to take this. Hello? - This is Michael Scott. - Yes, yes. You running late? I'm here. - No, I'm here. - Oh. - I'm at the bar. - I'm at the bar too. - You are? - Uh-huh. What bar? I'm at the the bar the bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel. I do not see you. How long have you I've been here about, gosh, over half an hour. Okay, yeah, me too. Sorry. Sorry. What are you wearing? I am wearing a gray suit, red tie. Are we both at the right place? Which place? - I hear your voice. - I hear your - I hear your voice - I see your lips moving. - In the phone. - And, oh, brother. And that's man! Michael Scott. D'Angelo Vickers. - Wow. - Ah. That is insane! "That is insane" is right. That's the right term. Bartender, let's get some vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend. There we go. Ready? - I am ready. - All right, here we go. Well, this is it. What do you think? She'll do. Oh, she'll do just fine. I am very much looking forward to tomorrow. Uh, it is, uh it feels like the culmination of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune, and, uh Hey, come on. Did that did that just happen? We should write a movie or something. I'm serious. Michael is leaving, and apparently they already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. That's a lot to process, paperwork-wise. No, it's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone. Equally handsome, equally smart. Okay, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for its own sake. So without further ado, let's all start clapping. Presenting D'Angelo Vickers! Hi! Hello. - Come on out! - Oh. Hello. Hey. How are you, sir? I'm well, sir. How are you? Uh, can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. A little bit about myself I love the American southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, new Mexico, Nevada, Utah. I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy. Something I live with. It's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else I'm just as comfortable at a ball game as I am at the opera. I was a did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? Mmm No. But life goes on. Not for me. I'll get that, guys. No, I'll help you. Here. You know, it's just you know? Oh, hi. Hello. Hi. Have we met before? No, not officially. I saw you coming out of the bathroom earlier. Well, I guess I'm gonna go back to my cave. Okay. It was really great meeting you. And that Is what they call a "meet cute." So we talked for, like, 20 minutes. No clue it's D'Angelo the whole time. That's kind of embarrassing. No, no. Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid. I happen to like the hilarious hijinks that I get myself into. There he is there D'Angelo, I was just telling them about last night when we met. - Oh. - Remember that? That was crazy. That was great. "Uh, let's see. Where's my replacement?" "Where's the guy I'm replacing?" I don't know. Why don't I look to my left? - I know. - You're sitting right there. I know. Well, that's that's what I was just saying. That's the that exact situation is why I always carry around a couple of these. Just in case, 'cause, you know, sometimes you need to I.D. Yourself. Office funny guy. Always glad to have an office funny guy around. I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sort of quirky. Offbeat. A little twisted. This is Jim and Pam, aka "Jap." What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes. Well, it was it wasn't an affair. - Yes, it was. - But, no but we are a family. We made that. - Cecilia. - Aw. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I have four kids of my own. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Well, we just have the one, but she poops for four. Uh-oh, someone started off on a good foot with the new boss. Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies, so. Psst. Thanks for meeting me. Are you kidding? I would come anywhere to see a turtle. - Yeah. - Where'd you find him? There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here. You know me very well, Dwight. - That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael. But I can't do it. I can't do it again. I can't be a right-hand man to a whole new guy. Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles, or else I'm gonna be off the whole day. I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. You know, what's wrong? I'm totally qualified. You were pushing for me. That apple looks delish. I do a lot of portion control. Try to keep my daily caloric intake under 1,200. D'Angelo, you're going to starve to death. So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? Come on! I call middle. It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions. "It's one of my favorite regions." Did I just sound totally lame? No. I sounded good. I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems. Here's the great thing about the southwest. There is so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the grand canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen. Burned. It's lush, dummy. Hey, uh, D'Angelo. What do you think about bald people? I hate them. D'Angelo, I forget, did you mention you liked politics? - I did not. - Because I was thinking, you should meet my boyfriend. He's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know. Sounds very interesting. Thank you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Okay, let me transfer you. Why do you use your name when you answer the phone? Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's she's sort of a living legend. Try it without using your name. Dunder Mifflin, this is. Oh, yeah. I like it. Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you? Oh, assist. I sort of like the old way. I just prefer it without the name. I thought Okay, no, no, no. I gotta start doing some managing at some point, right? I know, I know. I'm sorry. But if it's not a big deal, we should just do the old way. - And it really isn't. - Okay. That good? Yeah, okay, good. Well, I'd like to change it, actually. Well, you know, whatever. - Yeah. - Whatever you think would work. What do you think? I think a change would be nice. You could do the old way, or the, you know, whichever one you want to do. Change it. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Hey, funny guy. I'm having a little mid-day lull here. Make me laugh. Huh? What do you got? - Uh - I can't even look at you. Here we go. Okay. - Okay, what do, um, African-Americans call the - What? - Um. - D'Angelo. - Yeah? Did you order a barber? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Come on back here. Put a pin on that. I can't I can't wait to hear the punch line. Finish the joke, Andy. What do African-Americans call? I don't know. Help me. - That is so bad-ass. Just so hardcore. Yeah, very cool. Real power move. Yeah. Saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass, looking at me. Shave me. Well, this is going to be funny, because it looks like we're gonna be shaving buddies. Okay, all right. I love it. - Ha, ha, ha, ha! - I love it. Michael, this is Reggie. Hello. - He's the number-one yelp-reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close. And this is Erin, and she's going to shave my face. Here we go. All right. This is how we do it. - Mmm. - Feels nice, doesn't it? It really does. This is luxury. Here we go. Okay. Oh, that is nice. You wanted to talk to us, D'Angelo? Oh, yes, yes. Please cozy up there. I just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups. You know, we don't really do rap sessions. We kind of do God! We sort of do more of like pow-wows or whatevs. - Okay, well, pow-wows then, fine. That's Hey, D'Angelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece. It is so adorable. - All right, wait, but a little bit of back-story. She loves dogs. She calls them "da-das." - Da-das. - And what happens is you know what? Enough about your baby, okay? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, we were just I think she was just trying to no, no, no. I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? You know, what can I do better? Okay, you know what, everybody? There's you have to be honest here. You you can't say that everything is perfect, right? So, you know, come up with something. Well, D'Angelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them "urgent." Okay, you know what, I mark it urgent "a," urgent "b," urgent "c," urgent "d." Urgent "a" is the most important. Urgent "d" you don't even really have to worry about. Okay, um, Michael, can you stop talking now? I have to do your lips. Don't shave my lips. What's up? I don't mean to go off on a rant here, but I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy. Funny. I saw this thing in the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. Right. I'm thinkin' how crazy is it that we got a car debate goin' on in a city known for gridlock? UmLet's not talk politics in the office, okay? I like you better as the funny guy. I wasn't taking a a position. It was just sort of one of those things. Now, that's funny. That's funny. You walk much? Yeah! Right? I meanAh! - Little click. - Mm-hmm. D'Angelo, this box came for you. Great! Thank you. That's my stuff. - Oh! - Yeah. Michael, take a look at this. - Need a hand? - Oh, that'd be great. Thank you. Hey, you know what? This office sort of has a perfect fung shooey to it, andYou know, let's not go overboard with the redecorating. I'm still here, so Wow! - Right? - Nice. I still have to look at this stuff, guys, so - So this is a ten-gallon hat? - Yeah, you like that? Ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quarts. Little factoid. Interesting. D'Angelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a good fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy. All right, see you later, girl. Hey, hey, hey. Naw, I'm good. Keep that. Hey, funny man. What you got for me? Make me laugh. Let's see Let's see if my favorite tea is in here Oh, jeez! That's hot coffee! Drink some soap. Drink some hand soap. I guess this is my life now. How do I become a manager at sabre? Well, first things first. Thank you for coming to me directly, you know? I know you could have called Tallahassee, but they would have just looped back to me, so It's cool you recognize my role here. I left a message at corporate. UhThere you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the short list for next time there's an opening. Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file? What recommendation? From when he recommended me to replace him. I'm so I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations. Best whale watching. Easily the west coast. If you're gonna go whale watching on the east coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called west coast whales. 'Cause you're not gonna see 'em. Snack time. It's the witching hour. It is the sandwiching hour. - Awesome. - Mmm. What ya got? Pb and j. My mom's recipe. Michael, D'Angelo has a peanut allergy. Okay, I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts. What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? I think Kevin wants one. Kevin here ya go! Oh! Michael, this is serious. Do you know what happens if D'Angelo touches a peanut? - What? - Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, okay? Had to take baths constantly. I missed the oj verdict. Had to read about it in the paper like an idiot! Wait. So you don't go into like shock or die or anything. No, Jim. Not everything's life and death. I wanna feel comfortable. Oscar, here you go. You're getting nut particles all in the air! No one had a problem with the air here until you came around. Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multipurpose room, now. No, that's good. You just stay in there. Stay in there by yourself, loser. Nobody go in. What? - Nobody go in there. - What? - Stay where you are. - Michael, this is insane. No, it's not insane, Oscar. I've been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? N-no. Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on. He's our new boss. You know we have to do this. Ooh, well. Who needs 'em? Looks like it's just you and me, Dwight. Correction. Just you. All right. Meeting, multifunction room. Hey, Michael. Michael, wait up. Hold up, hold up. So so for these meetings, do you just do you just jump into business, or do you start with some chitchat or I start with some chitchat and maybe a couple of jokes. And you might wanna develop a couple of characters. Go on, you just you'll be fine. Maybe. Maybe not. - No. - You know, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. Bring it in. Come on. Bring okay. Okay. Why did you have to be so damn good? I I'm adequate. I-I'm half as good as you. - No, no, no. - Oh, come on. You are good. They know it. Come on. I just didn't expect you to get there so fast. Would you do me a favor and enjoy this time, okay? You've worked so hard. Get your senioritis on. It's lake Havasu time. Guess I been working so hard, I Forgot what it's like to be hardly working. Okay. What is the Native American girl's name? You'll figure it out. Thank you, Dwight. - Um - Listen up! Hey, D'Angelo. Want to meet Cece? That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable, very cute. Thank you very much. See? We knew it. If he just met her - he'd understand. - We're back in. Right? I'm telling you, that baby could be the star of a show called "babies I don't care about".
It is 6 AM, and Deangelo and I are about to go house to house to give everybody their Dundies nomination certificate just like the oscars. Yes. And this happens every year? Every year this happens. You have a lot to learn, my friend. Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good, it'll be part of my tradition. Why are you even saying that? You're gonna love it. Here we go. This one. This way. Nice house. - Surprise! - Congratulations! Yep. You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie awards. Okay. - Rawr! - There we go! Have Pam come out. No, no, she's not here. What's going on? Stay in bed. - Congratulations. - Stanley, we love you. Have you lost your mind? Get off my property before I call the police. All right, we got it. Good. - Leave it at the door? - Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Hey, Toby, you suck! Is this an employee of ours? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Gosh, I've never seen this place in the daylight. This reminds me of Katrina. Here we go. All right. You got it? Are we set? Hello? I'm so busted. Walk of shame. Do you usually leave your door unlocked and ajar? Nice! I got a Dundie nomination. - Yes, you did. - Yes, that's right. No big deal. Congratulations, Meredith. All right, well, we should head out. No, no, no, you gotta stay. No, no, no, I have vienna sausages and I have napkins. Let me fix you breakfast. I'm not going in there. Go. Good morning, Erin. Oh, hey, didn't see you. Any big plans for tonight? I don't know. Maybe volunteer at the women's shelter, go to bed. Or, I don't know, maybe I'm going to the Dundies! You are getting so funny. Very good. The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry king died, they didn't just cancel his show. They got piers Morgan to come in and do his show, and that way Larry lives on. Anything can happen at the Dundies. They're like the golden globes but less mean. And I just want us to all have a good time. Just a little announcement, folks. Remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair. Black tie optional. Every day is black tie optional. Fyi, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpe's. - Nice. - I love their breadsticks. Oh, their breadsticks are like crack. I love when people say "like crack" who have obviously never done crack. Well, their breadsticks are like what then, Ryan? What can I use? I don't know, something from your world. "The breadsticks are like scrapbooking." You're right. No, I'm a middle class fraud. Shh, okay, okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right? Yeah, that's great. So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year I have decided to have a co-host. And that person is Deangelo. Always the Padawan, never the Jedi. Thank you, Michael, but I will have to pass. Think of it as part of your training. I'm not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay. Okay, well, we'll work on it. Look, I'm very, very bad. Very bad. You're doing it. Guys, I want you to help us work on some banter. Yes, I love banter. But I hate witty banter. Here we go. So, Deangelo, you and I have a lot in common. You lost 200 pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning. That is true. We do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems. For me, it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe hang it on the-- Okay, okay, you know what, I didn't actually lose my keys. - So this did not happen? - Mm-kay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan, come on up here. Deangelo, if you would just-- Tap Deangelo out. - If I can see it-- - Just watch us. Okay, Ryan, how are you today? Why don't you ask my therapist? My mom certainly pays her enough. There you go! Lovely. Regis and Kelly. Nice. Use that as an inspiration. - Okay. - Just be funny. Uh, you sir, are we having fun tonight? - Having a great time. - Oh, good, good. Where were you on September 11th? No, gosh. No, no, stop, stop. What? This is so weird. If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance, I fall apart obviously. Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting? No, no, no. This is the performance of your life. Why don't you just privately in your own head think of it like a meeting? Jim, please, no loopholes. Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind? This is my last Dundies ever. If I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask? Me, mo, me, mo. Good. Good. Good. Good. Now tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood. When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court to choose between them. Too personal. I don't wanna hear about that stuff. Let's try this, put this on. I am going to turn this on. And turn the volume all the way up so you can't-- That's right! You're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this and it's going to sound perfect. "The Dundies are com-- "All about coming together! "And recognizing the indomitability of the human spirit!" Say it with an accent. - "The Dundies--" - The Dundies! - The Dundies! I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me. I just want regular fries. Yeah. Hey, Erin, everything okay? Get away from the car. He's gonna see you. Who's gonna see us? Just get in, get in. Just get in. Get in the car? Please! Sorry. Get in. Sorry, sorry, sorry. What's wrong? I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe. Why don't you want to eat lunch with your boyfriend? I really don't like spending time with him. Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now, you know, rather than waste more of his time? - I think I'm gonna go. - What? - I think you got this. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - All right? - Okay. - Feel better. - Thank you, Jim. I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me. I can't just dump him, Pam. I'm not like you. I can't be mean. - Wait, when am I-- You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. - Hi. - Appalling. Eyesore. Surprisingly adequate. Okay, everyone, the festivities commence in four seconds. Deangelo, Jo's on the phone for you. Hello? Deangelo, we're in serious horse manure here. The Dundies are tonight, and we ain't got no host. Oh, no! Luckily, I have someone for you. - Billy crystal? - Better. Neil Patrick Harris? He's in little shop of horrors on Broadway. No, we need Michael Scott, the best darn Dundies host both sides of the Mississippi. I gotta find Michael Scott. Hmm, and then I gotta Get him to the Dundies! Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott, Angela? My boyfriend can. He's a state senator. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, no, he can't help, because that title has no meaning. Try Jim, Deangelo. He'll be able to help. Jim, do you know where I can find Michael Scott? Oh, I totally don't know where Michael is, dude. Hey, you want to listen to some records? No one's listening to me! I'm running out of time. What-- What are you talking about? I've fallen and I can't get up. Maybe I just need to look into my heart. Deangelo, where is Michael Scott? I'm here. In a good way. I've been here the whole time. The analytical part of me wants to examine it. But I know it has no content. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for your co-host of the evening, Michael Gary Scott. Please remain standing for your other co-host and new manager, Deangelo Jeremetrius Vickers! Is that part of the-- Hey. Deangelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there. Just go do it by yourself, or get Ryan. No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss hosts the Dundies. It's sort of our perk. This was not part of the job description. Okay, listen to me. You're not doing this for me. You're not doing this for you. You're not even doing this for them. What am I doing it for? You're doing it for all those kids out there eating off the Louie Volpe's kids' menu, who are wondering, "does it get better?" What I want you to do is I want you to say "it's showtime." Get out there. I can't. - Say it. - Stop hitting me. You can do it. Just say it. Hit me again. Now hit me. One, two, three. It's showtime. All right, here we go. Okay, okay, sorry about the delay, everybody. But we were at the DMV waiting in line. Fall asleep right after sex, huh, guys? Nope. Go back to the script. There are a lot of great salesmen in this office. But one of our great salesmen is also a great dad, and a close personal friend of mine. Jim Halpert, best dad Dundie! Wow, I do not parent for the awards, but I gotta tell you, it feels pretty good. Um, Cece, if you're watching this at home, it's way past your bedtime. By the way, how did this get televised? Thanks. - Well done. - I don't know. Maybe being a good dad is just following your own compass. I don't know. I don't know. Thank you. Didn't think to mention me, huh? Didn't I? Which moves us to best mom Dundie. This person, well, I guess we all sort of consider a mom around the office-- Meredith Palmer! I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight. Excuse me. Can I get a photo of the best mom and the best dad, please? Step on up. Well, I gotta go do this. Why? Big smiles, folks. There they are. Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year, I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to Danny Cordray! How do I feel about not winning hottest in the office this year? Um, I'm very relieved. How do you-- How do you judge something like that? What is his criteria even? It's-- It's so subjective. Stanley Hudson is a grump. Everybody knows that. But did you know that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The diabetes award goes to Stanley Hudson! Come on up here, you sick bastard. We're proud of you. I have diabetes too, but you don't see me making a big deal about it. They say he's going to be my right-hand man. Ad lib masturbation joke. Nope. I hate this. I hate it so much. Dwight Shrute, please accept this promising assistant manager Dundie. Thank you. Thanks so much. Um, I want to dedicate this award to something that, uh, we take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trash can. This is for you, trash can! Who gave you those crayons? I brought them from home. Do you have a red? This is a cloth tablecloth. You can't color on it. Oh, really? Did you know herpes affects one out of every five sexually active adults? Pippi Longstocking. Ronald McDonald's wife. Ron Howard. Ron Weasley. What do they all have in common? Redheads. Erin Hannon Come on up here to receive your cutest redhead in the office award! This is bull! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. People were right about the Dundies. They are magical. But I don't feel it, and I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe - What? - We should break up. What? I'm not attracted to you. I just--I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right? Right, Pam? Thank you for hearing me. Okay, well, this is embarrassing. Um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. Here comes that quarter-life crisis everyone's talking about. All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go. Let's-- There you go. Damn, that was cold. It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy. So the Michael Scott award for best Dundies host goes to Deangelo Vickers. Speech, speech, speech, speech! Hold on. Hold on one second. Okay. Crank it. I want to--I want-- I feel truly blessed, uh, to be working with all of you. You know, before this all started, uh, funny story, I was in the bathroom vomiting and vomiting. The men's room. That's why it's been shut down for most of the evening. That's it! This is important. He's expressing himself. - No. - Hosts don't get Dundies. This-- This is truly special for me And, uh, anyway, it's so much lighter! - We're done. - That's it. - Michael, are we-- What? - We're done. We're done. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it would be more like Godfather III. That wrapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead, it is Godfather I. That was very confusing, had maybe three big laughs Oh, well. Hey, Michael. We were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going. What? I know I'm the cause of this royal screw-up, but I would like to see the show go on. No, don't. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time. Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. So what you're saying is you kinda liked it. I've fallen and I can't get up! The Phyllis bit, that was pretty good, right? - I don't know that we need to dissect it all right now-- - But that got a big laugh. - It did. That actually got a big laugh. We were laughing, right? I was. Oh, you know what, I have to go to the bathroom. We're really close. You know, I can just run over to the gas station there. We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room? That's true, we wouldn't get seats together. Okay, yeah. I'll hold it. I'm fine. You know, despite a couple hiccups, I thought that went very well. I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to. Man. Maybe you should have won the kind of a bitch award. Oh, gladly, I'd accept that award, because a bitch is a female dog. Okay. What? What are you doing? Please don't stop so suddenly. Seatbelt's pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt? You're sitting in the back seat, baby. What is your problem? I just don't see the point to the Dundies, okay? The jokes were terrible, the venue was bad, the fashion was boring-- Okay, that-- That is unfair. The clothing was safe but tasteful. And next time, why don't you pick a co-host that doesn't have microphone-aphobia. Look, whatever you're going to do, how long is it gonna take? Ballpark? 'Cause I just-- I've gotta make a decision here. He-- He is in an all-out sprint. Please, excuse me. Here, okay. By his own admission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the doobie-doobie pothead stoner of the year award goes to Andy Bernard! There's a lot of people I'd like to thank. But I think we all actually want to thank you, Michael. Oh, thank you. I mean, we actually really all want to thank you for everything. Oh, my God, something's happening.  we actually sat down and did the math  that's how many minutes that you've worked here  email forwards you made us read  that's like watchidie hard  I forgive you for kissing me  oh, you got to remember to call  love is a gift from up above  yeah yeah you got to remember to call yeah, okay. Well, this is gonna hurt like a mother. Suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the extreme repulsiveness award. Oh, that's so mean. No, it's fine. It's his last Dundies. You gotta play along, man. Come on, Toby. Here he comes! All right. You deserved it. I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Although I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case that I was recently a juror on, The Scranton strangler. A man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty anymore.
Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here getting used to the altitude. - Michael? - Yes? I've got a treat for you. Thank you. Like a butler. Colorado specialty-- Rocky Mountain oysters. Wow, those do not taste like oysters. That's because they're not oysters. They're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Sick freak. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you. I'm the sick freak? After what you did, you expect to be buttled? After you didn't recommend me? Dwight, I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? The job was not mine to give. Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the rockies. Where did you hear that? Obvious XM radio? Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket Great idea. In order to feed the bears. Especially if you think that life would be better without legs! How do you mean? Black bears can smell a salami at five Miles, Michael. What are you thinking? And they run faster than a horse. So if you were thinking about outrunning them on a horse, I would try a cheetah. You in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a black bear. - Do you understand? - Mm-hmm. You're like a giant walking salami. Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni? Any kind of meat you can possibly name. Okay. You're not gonna take all your toys, are you? I mean, you don't-- You don't have a job lined up, so It's not like you have a desk to put 'em on. Well, I have interviews. That's nice. What about that truck? Can I have this little truck? Was thinking thinking I might glue a stapler on top or put a hole here and stick pens in it. You okay? Yes. Yes, you know what, take my favorite truck, sure. You know what, uh It's your last couple of days. I'm gonna get out of your hair. Oh, you don't-- I will be in the break room. Okay, that sounds good. Thank you. Dead man walking. Sad? No. No, no. I don't leave till tomorrow, so tomorrow I will be a wreck. - Stay away from Erin. - Hey. I'm your boss. Why don't you, uh, stay away from me? No, I'm gonna stand where I want, okay? You don't want to get on my bad side. I've seen some horrible things. I own over 200 horror movies. Okay, that's so weird! Just go away! No, you go away. Hi, Jim. You guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now? How about cupcakes? Please. - What's wrong with cupcakes? - Everything. There they are. The party planning committee together again. Well, we all wanted to plan your good-bye party. We thought this would be easier. We thought. It's an experiment. The three of us have all been chairmen before. So this is the dream team. Hey! What are you saying? The dream team and Meredith. We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip-- Your favorite. Yeah, that was a surprise. You know what? I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody will like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla. Okay. Tomorrow, I want everybody to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. All right? Should we get toppings? - What do you like, Pam? - What? What kind of topping would you like? Hot fudge? Sounds good. Fudge it up. I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. I still need something to drink out of, though. Attention, everyone. Before I leave tomorrow, I would like to reveal a secret that I have kept for over 20 years. Secret about Phyllis. Please, Michael. When Phyllis was in high school, she was so cute. And she still is. I thought he knew about the baby I gave away. Look, Michael, it's a going-away present so your hands won't get cold. It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring dry gently, and use a hair dryer on cool. Sounds great. I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well. And I will start by giving the first gift to Phyllis. Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should, because you have great ideas. So, Phyllis, I am giving you this so you can always remember to speak your mind. Gee, thanks, Michael. - You're welcome. - It's cute. Stanley, you love your sudoku and your puzzles. I bestow upon you My felt. May you never lose the fun-loving quality in life. Where's the rest of it? It's got no balls. Well, okay. And Andy. Andy, who needs confidence that he is a great salesman, I give you my clients. Our ten most important accounts. - Wow. - Yeah, wow. You know I'm the worst salesman here, right? But you're the best salesman on the inside. What does that even mean? You sold us all on Andy-- A product that nobody wanted. I'm gonna lose 'em. You're not going to lose them. I promise you that I will. Just do your best. I have faith in you. Gimme those clients. No. Do you believe that? I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing or the decent thing or even the comprehensible thing. I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but let me just put it this way, if I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. Kevin, I have something for you. You know who that is? Don't be a caricature, Kevin. Never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up? - Better? - Good. Stand up. You will be thin. You won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore. But, I-- You will find love. Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now. Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar. Oscar, you are a-- Michael, I just lost Porter hardware! I just-- I lost 'em. Okay, you know what? Just do your best, buddy. Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education, and I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. Thank you, Michael. It's beautiful. It looks like It looks like it was made by a two-year-old monkey on a farm. And he just He just accepted it, that I That I put all this work into it. Oh, man. He-- He has the lowest opinion of me of anybody. Was it just me, or did you think we were gonna have sex at some point? It was just you. How would you have wanted to do it? I--don't. Okay, you know what? Inappropriate, because I am engaged happily, and you, you have landed yourself a senator. State senator. Mm-hmm. Bravo. - Brava. - Bra--? Do you want to see some pictures? I just got these. Sure. Um, these are-- Okay, um, this is us at the theater. Ohh! And, uh, antiquing. Oh, rollerblading. Rollerblading. Who's that? Who's that guy? Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide. I guess this could be the one, huh? Yeah. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Um, I'm gonna be dropping in on one of our biggest clients this afternoon, and I could use some backup. Let's rip it up, homes. All right. Boom. Walk away, bitch. - Oh, um, Michael. - Hmm? Uh, where do you want your last paycheck sent? Last paycheck? Do you have an address yet in Colorado? No. What town do Holly's parents live in? I'm not sure. Um, MountainTon, I think. Sounds beautiful. You should do more stuff like that. I'm going to. Hey. It's almost your last day. Come on. Sit with us. No, I'm almost done. - You sure? - Yeah. So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder. Finally. That old shredder sucked. It's a good shredder. It just keeps breaking. Yeah, and it won't shred magazines. It's not supposed to shred magazines, Kevin. I know. Did you break the shredder, Kevin? No. It's just that old shredder sucks. Just get one that'll shred magazines. I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines. I can't-- I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one. I don't think my credits are gonna transfer. And you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. I gotta call her. And I'm going to tell her that I cannot come. Hello there. Hi. What is the name of our town? Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay? No. No, I just needed to hear your voice. Oh, you mean this? Yeah. Yes, my hero. I'll pay the rent. Okay, my mom's looking at me like she has no sense of humor. It's a joke. Oh, I miss you. Well, I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim. Okay, I'll see you tonight. I love you. I love you, too. Yeah, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm-- I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I, uh, head to the airport at 4:00. And, uh, I have said good-bye to half of them. Well, you know Michael, I have a brother, in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up. Okay. Okay? Ahem, Kelly? Kelly? Kelly? What? If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you? Yes, please. Please go away and stop using that weird, slow voice. She was once my girl, and she is your girl now. Wow. Yeah. This is totally unnecessary. You're not prone to seizures? No. So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want? - Erotic. - See? This is what happens. You can't let a street dog into the house. Mmm, let's hear her out. I would, uh, like to hear more about these cakes. I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop. Good God. They make these cakes that are wild. I mean They show everything. I don't--I don't think we want a-- No, I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black. They do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guys' fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing. Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue. As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it just feels good to be represented on one. You know what? I think we should get some other input. I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake. Yeah, cupcakes, that's what I said. No. I am not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms. You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker. Um, Pam? Oh, hey, Michael. I'm just gonna go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later. Okay. Gabe! I need to talk to you. You can't be in here. This is a ladies' bathroom. No, Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here Every time you go if that's what it takes. Hey, creed. Not cool, man. I really think you should leave. Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room. Gabe, can we talk about this later? I have to go. I have to go. Just read the letter under your windshield wiper. It explains everything. - Okay. - Okay? Do you want-- - Gabe! Well. Here's the thing, Rory. I think you guys would hit it off in an odd way. I could bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him. Okay, well, you should give him a little time to settle in, but Does he like jams? My shelves are overflowing with preserves. Well, no, he hates jams. Darryl. Hey. I would like to give you the only copy of somehow I manage, unfinished. If there's anybody here who can finish it, it's you. That's sweet, Mike. Let's see here. Here's a chapter called "gum." - Mmm. - With one sentence. "Everybody likes the guy who offers them a stick of gum." Mm-hmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the baler. No. Can't let you do that, Mike. - No problem. - Sorry. - Worth a try. - All right. Darryl said I could use the baler because I'm leaving. No. All right, guys, well, see ya later, warehouse. Catch you on the flippety-flip. All right then, see you guys. Catch you later, warehouse. See you on the flippety-flip. Catch you on the flippety-flip. Catch you guys on the flippety-flip. Come on. Okay. So what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality. That's stupid. Well, what do I know? I know. What you know? We gotta get psyched up. Okay, guy? Let's get psyched. Is there an animal shelter on the way? Yeah. Awesome! Ani-ani-shelto. Here we come. Andy, do you know how to high-five? Yeah. 'Cause if you do, now's the time. All right. Not while I'm driving. Catch you guys Catch you guys on the flippety-flip. Flippety-flip. Flippety-flip. Really? Okay, see you guys. You know how I met Bennet and got started on my ladder of success? No, I don't. Walkin' along, out of workAgain, thinking to myself, I've only got enough cash to buy a sandwich or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog. So I grab the dog, he runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me. Aw, wow. Gimme that dog! It's not your dog! Yeah. - Again. - Oh, okay. Gimme that damn dog, you [Bleep] Thief! It's her dog! Don't ever do it again! You hear me? You feel that energy? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Whoo! Yeah. Okay, again. I know that Gabe is young and hot and everything, and he's begging me to reconsider, but II just think I'm in love with someone else. Kevin? Andy. I wish I knew who my birth mother was so she could just tell me who to choose. Maybe neither. I'm not attracted to Kevin. Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this at all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful, and you are fun, and you are smart. And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. Hey. And you know what? You don't need a mom, because you have my number and you can call me anytime. Extension 147. - N - I know. Okay. Okay. Did you want the 2726 or the 2730? Phyllis? Phyllis, are my mittens done? - No. No. I'm on a sale-- Okay, listen, it's 2:00 P.M. From now until 4:00, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind. Okay. Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. Yes? So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation. This is gonna be good. Ahem. "To whom it may concern." Good, real personal. Thanks, Michael. "The dictionary defines 'superlative' "as 'of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else or others; Supreme.'" that's great. If I wanted the dictionary definition, I'd buy a dictionary. "I define it as Dwight Shrute. "As a sales executive, as a leader, "as a man, and as a friend, "he is of the highest kind, quality, and order; Supreme." Lots more like that. Really repetitive. What's this? "2:45 behind the building, paintball." Come on, come on! Give it up! Yaah! I would like to start by just saying that I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard here for very long. But I can say that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you that he's gonna be a success. Uh, I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. But I can say this. He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say, "go big or go home." You go with this guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life. Or the biggest good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher, who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it for the agreed-upon price, Andy's not your guy. You ever play Russian roulette? Time to spin the chamber, Boris By signing up for another year. Uh, what happened to you? You should see the other guy. Jim, where is Pam? Uh, she's still pricing the whatevers The shredders. But it is already 3:00. Right. Whether you're scared of dying or dying alone or dying drunk in a ditch, don't be. It's going to be okay. Yeah, I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody. And you, why are you still here? I'm either gonna quit today or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed. No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day at the office. Everybody gets dumped, Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, which will make you look less like a transvestite. That is cold, sir. Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time. Uh, Deangelo, I'm, uh I forgot my bag, so I'm gonna I'll meet you in the car. Okay, whatever. Sir. I'd just like to apologize for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is, I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call. Keep talkin'. Yes. Okay. All right. No. Well, thank you. Thank you. All right. Take care. You'll never guess. We did it. Hey! Ohh! All right. All right. Good job, boss. We did it. Yeah. Okay, everybody, come on. Conference room, five seconds! Here we go! Hurry up! Let's do this! Yes. What is this about? - What is this meeting about? - Mm-hmm. All right. Well Okay. Here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here together because I have something important Well, there's two things, actually. Okay, first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam, and, secondly, Phyllis, how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them, and I am leaving for the day at 4:00. They're almost done, but my knuckles are swelling a little, and I can't-- Well, power through the arthritis, Phyllis. You can do it. Is that it? Is that it? No. No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye, so here he comes. He's coming right in. Hi, everybody! It's ping! And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people. Thank you, everybody! You've been so wonderful. We were such a good-- I "rove" you all. I "rove" you very much. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. See you later! So I've been meaning to tell you. I want to take you out for lunch. For your last day. What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch? You and me? Okay. You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today, right? Maybe. Wow, so that's it, huh? Just 4:00 and you are gone for good. Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing? Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes goodbyes are a bitch. T-shirt idea. "Goodbyes stink." Okay. All right. So James Halpert You started with this company As a fine young man. You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch. Oh. Okay. And then tomorrow I can tell you What a great boss you turned out to be. Best boss I ever had. Oh, shoot. That's my cab. - All right. - All right. Listen, Michael, I really-- I did text Pam, but I know. It's okay. Just give her a hug, all right? I will see you tomorrow at lunch. I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am. You got it. Okay. Okay. Phyllis. Mm-hmm. Oh, they're still not done. Oh, no, no, no. Let me see. Oh, Phyllis. Nice try. I love 'em. See ya tomorrow, boss. Later, guys. Well, got almost everybody, so Holly's my family now. She's my family. And the babies that I make with her will be my children. The people that you work with are just, when you get down to it, your very best friends. They say on your deathbed you never wish you spent more time at the office, but I will. Got to be a lot better than a deathbed. I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that? Well, I guess this is it. Hey, will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. All right. Oh. This is gonna feel so good getting this thing off my chest. No, he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado. And he was hoping to get an upgrade as an awards member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly. Well, if he's not gonna make it, at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. Yeah. I, for one, love the corners. Why did I just do that? This is not even that good. I don't even-- I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. What am I doing? Come on, Deangelo. Hey No! No! The Office is all new for the rest of the season, so let's see what's new next week.
So, coasting time. It's officially over. Big changes are coming, and they're coming fast. And if you don't like them, this is called a door, you can walk right through it, all right? I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5:00. Change number one: Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride, deal with it. Seriously? Stone cold seriously. They are trying to figure me out, and I don't like it. Once they figure me out they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker, and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I wanna hear, I'm not gonna care. Toby. You're getting a new chair. - Nice. - Don't thank me. Hey, don't thank me, guy. Okay? And I don't care if you like it. These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them? I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream, you either like it or you don't. That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on ice cream Thursdays. All right? Clear? Any questions? This all sounds great to me. But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think. That is a-- An astute observation, Kevin. Kev's got me pegged. It blows away Vermont in the fall. Snap, for real? - Not even-- - Good morning, Deangelo. - Hold on, Pam. - Okay. And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring. - 'Cause of the flowers. - No. Because the entire state smells like earth. Dogwoods, or just the earth? Yes, Pam. Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. She's got great experience, we even considered making her Cece's godmother. But she had this boyfriend at the time. But here's her resume. Put it with the rest. Okay. Hey, dudes. Hey. Hey. - Oh, my God, he hates me. - No, he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him. I know. Every time there's a silence, you're brain's, like Is that what he tells you at your little inner-circle meetings? Careful, there is no inner circle. Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh, yeah. There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things to a few guys. Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that, because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is in the inner circle. Which doesn't exist. There he is. Got you a coffee. Oh, wow, thank you, that was so kind of you. Not a coffee guy I take it, huh? It's just that I own the coffee shop. So once you've seen sausage being made, all you wanna do is make sausage. 'Cause it's so much fun. Listen, I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the people," on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown, come on. Pick up some sausage if you want. I think you'll find what you're looking for over there. No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight. Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh, what do you guys say? - Yes. - Yeah. - Huh, right? - Let's do it. Or my other idea, Yeah, I say that we just go for it. Whoa, is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knock-off? That's "toys r' us" I think. No, that's definitely a knock-off. You can feel the center of gravity is off. Feel that, what do you think? Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time. Deangelo! See what I did there? Oh, that's what you need to do. Just add a little English. The British are coming. - Yes. - Deangelo's open! Hey, Ry. Your department's killing it, baby. Hey! My pleasure, my treasure. Keep it up. The problem with having "it," or, "the x-factor," or whatever it is you wanna call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say. What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why should I pretend that you are my boss? Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you. Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie. I'd die for you too. You really would? Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company. - Sure thing, Mr. Howard. - Whoo. Glad he's not my boss. Ooh, you're the best, thank you. You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's. Congratulations on your one cousin. I have 70-- Each one better than the last. You know what? Straight up, why don't you like me? I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here, okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone, and let me do it. Okay? Oh, no. - Wha--? - Okay? I'm gonna win you over. No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No. - Oh, yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - No. - Yes! - Yes! - No! - No. - Yes. - Yes, yes, yes, yes! - No, no! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Uh-oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative," and "assistant." The winner. Under "special skills," Mr. Don finer put "juggling." What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine. - Seriously? - Oh, yeah. I'd do it for you here but, uh, what would you say this room is? It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? Oh, I think it's 18 hundo. Give or take. Sorry, gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car, but it's not. Oh, no, do you think it was stolen? I got you covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. Got some extra balls. Hey! Whoa! Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued. Why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls. Prepare to go into the danger zone. Oh, wow, you weren't kidding. No, never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare. Incoming! And we're on. Remember, nothing's impossible. - Phyllis, where's Phyllis? - Here. Do you believe in me, Phyllis? - Yes. - 'Cause I believe in you. Oh, okay. Feel that connection? Don't move your head, please, thank you. Aah! Big hand for Phyllis. That took a lot of guts. I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much. Hope you learned something. - Whoo! - Whoo! He didn't drop a single ball. Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands. What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine? What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him? He's good at his job, and I like working for him. Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was a sexist I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the vagina monologues called the penis apologies. So I know a thing or two. Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the accounting department, but he only ever talks to Kevin. What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads, but has he ever met with you? Or even asked you to do anything? Huh, how could I not see it? You're so right. Why don't you talk to him about it? And say what? Hey, Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist? Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office. And if he doesn't listen then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls? Hey, do you have a second? Yeah, I got tons of time, this job's a joke. So what's up? Um, really, it's nothing. I was just talking to Angela. - Mm-hmm. - And she was-- - Hey. Saw Jim come in, are we meeting? Yeah, sure, let's make it a meeting. If it's all right, can I just have, like, one minute alone, just to go over-- What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys. I know, just the guys. Well, maybe that's part of the problem, I think. So what happened was, I was talking to some of the department heads. Right. Uh, some of the female department heads. - Uh-oh. - Yeah. - Right? - Hot. Maybe there's a vibe out there with certain members of the office that you are a little sexist, or-- - Damn! - Whoa. Whoa, wait. Are you serious? Who feels this way? - Oh, like, nobody, it was-- - Uh, Pam? Was it Pam? Oh, my gosh. That sounds like Pam. Yeah. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. Kevin, wah-wah. - Guys. - Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention. Because honestly, I had no idea. - That's awesome. - Thank you. Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not gonna stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again. So I am the new customer service supervisor. When deangelo's around. - And I'm also a very dutiful boyfriend when-- - All the time. - All the time. Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand-new executive assistant? Absolutely. Hey, who'd you end up hiring? I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I'm a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I'm not. I'm not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a vagina. Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina. Yeah, yeah, okay. Just about everyone. What about deangelo's hand? Oh, wow. He's got 'em both up. Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah. So it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens. I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't. Dwight. What's your take? What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all. Man, your smart. Oh, hey, hi. Hello. Hi. Welcome. Uh, everyone. I'd like you to please welcome Jordan garfield. This is everyone. Hello. So Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office? No, anthropologie. "We don't have this and that size." Pretty--pretty lame. - Hm. Lame? You worked at anthropologie? - Yes. - That's, like, my dream job. How did you even get that job? Well, I, um-- You chose this job over that job? Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly. We have a lot to get done today. So, um, is this your first office job then? - Yeah. - Yup. Wow. No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits. Jim, you coming? Oh, yeah, did he text us? Yeah. No! Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand, at least he likes one of us. He didn't text me. Yes! I'm in. Andy, what are you doing? Uh, I'm going in to the belly of the beast. I'm gonna infiltrate and change from within. What's up, man cave! - Just go in. - Hm? Just go in, he probably just forgot to text you. Internally for office use. Where do we get our paper from? Do we go and--do we have that system? Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest. Yeah. - Hey, Jim. - Yeah. Can I help you? Nope, just Okay. So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh? No, there is no inner circle. Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I could help you with? Really? Anything? Do you need anything? Deangelo? Tell your whore to leave me alone! Okay, I do not wanna waste your time, so I will keep this brrrrrrrrief! Now, word on the street is mercy hospital. Back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the barnacle project, which is a non-profit organization based in mystic, Connecticut, that assists in the scraping of barnacles-- So this is my life. Until I win the lottery. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books. So one afternoon while walking home from school, quirky tenth grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes "the horse flyer." Hey, Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck, okay? We pay you a fair salary here and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all. No one likes a money-grubber. I'm sorry, Mr. Howard. I apologize for grubbing for money-- I can't do this, I can't do this. I--I'm sorry, I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss, okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years. Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly. No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically, just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding. Is this true, Ryan? I did not see Rango. Okay, I don't have time for this "he said, she said." He's not saying anything! It's too murky. I like Ryan, you seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way. But it's not fair, I've been working here for such a long ti-- Close call. Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2:00 A.M., huh? Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Oh, angry, angry dunk. Hey. It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud and some of us are trying to work, so Okay. Do you think you could do it a little more quietly? Well, that's gonna be tough because we're getting a dunking clinic from magic Jordan himself. Oh, you mean, uh, Michael Jordan? Total brain-burp. I'm no MJ. Please. I can do his dunk, from the free-throw line though. Damn! Mad respect from a brother! The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say. And soon, I will say it in Chinese. Okay, well, it's just really loud. Okay. We'll keep that in mind. All right, ladies. Back to the game. Do it! And Jim. Come on in. You're back in. You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? Love to see that dunk of yours. Yeah, we'll set that up one day. Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs. And a real ball, so you don't have to mime it. Yeah, I don't know. Why not? Only because no one has called NASA to request a lift-off. - Let's go downstairs, okay? - Let's definitely do that. - Let's do it. - Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest I'd lock Mose in the chicken Coop. Damn it, Dwight, enough! Get your ass downstairs, or find a new place to sell paper! Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership. - All right, there you go. - Seems a little close. You're sure that's the real foul line? So you need me to move it in? Nah, that's 15. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket? - Seriously? - Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you, best seat in the house. - I don't--I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry. Right, yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it. - Yes, okay. - Why don't you? Here? Someone wanna sit in Kevin's lap? - Angela? - No. - Oscar? - No, thank you. Okay, Jimmy, this is for you, to show you that anything is possible. - Fantastic. - All right? - Yup. - This is also for the troops. Doctor is in! Now what? - Deangelo? - Tablab. Oh, my God, are you all right? Erin, would you call 911 please? Who should I say is calling? Erin. Chea three thead twa to bar. Scoince? Paunch and loud. Paunch says to barter how's gonna tha. Barte sayce four tha pa. Everybody tine, everybody tha. Everybody tha. Dra tweb. Yeah. Dra sweb. Treasure, yeah, I get it. Okay, we're gonna work on treasure.
We can get Deangelo flowers. No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up. - Yeah, that's true. - Good point. All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, Teddy bears, and balloons. Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse Nope. Baskets have it. So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that-- People like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high. Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. That was Jo asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus. People are happy. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan. Gather my things from my desk. Wait [Door slams] What have you done? Mose You'll never guess where I am right now. Aaaaahhhhh! [Cheerful music] [Knocking at glass] Can't stay there all day. I'm coming. Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy? You'd slow me down. Dwight has been acting manager forThree months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see We all have to punch into a time clock which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition. Which is how I learned that our titles are all now junior employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30. And I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours. Stop stalling. Come on. All: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. - Amen. - Excellent. Morning announcements. There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you and you only, okay? Don't share it. Jo Bennett, our ceo, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. Ooh. About what? That's on a need-to-know basis. I thought I needed to know for your calendar. General meet and greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate nor will you foment insurrection. Question. If we've already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in? - Define foment. - You define foment. [Ahem] Please take note of the new color-coding system. Aha! Oh, my God! What is wrong with you? Gotcha! Why are you late? It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal. All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so Oh! Darryl's funny. - I know, right. - Hey, Andy? - Yeah. - Can I talk to you a second about these client memos? Sure. What's going on? Are you still in love with Erin? What? Because I am. I need to get her back. [Crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now? No. This is horrifying. No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? [Crying] I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her? We're just friends, okay? Do you promise that? Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now? No. Just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the fist? Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French revolution or the black panthers or communism. It's just a club. Guys talkin'. You know. You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion? Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. Okay, you know what? I would love to join the fist. And we would love to have you-- But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with operation overthrow and everything. But I have noted it. [Beep] One [Beep beep] [Beep beep] [Beep beep] Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling With a fart mixed in. [Buzzer] I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also be never less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life, because I am manager of the Scranton branch of Dunder-Mifflin. Acting manager. No food now! Someone has to do something about Dwight. He put some snacks in the freezer for us. You mean the frozen mice for the piranha? No. The blueberry slurpee pouch. Hmm. He means the ice pack. be okay. I can either take your number or-- I'm sorry. This can't wait. He's just gonna call back. Erin. I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Quietly] What? Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what-- What God is. But for all of the disbelief [Telephone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. [Ringing] You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [Ringing] OutThere Uh, do we not have voice mail? Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages. [Ringing] Well It's just [Ringing] It messes up my rhythm. But I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him. Wow. You've really embraced the whole bond villain aesthetic. Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue. And the desk. The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business. - Okay. - Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior. I promised other people that I'd be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so Don't make me fire you. You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers. Don't make me pre-fire you. You wouldn't dare. Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired. [Quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then. What? If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "well, that's pretty premature to think," but I always say it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared. - How you doing, Jordan? - I'm good. Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly. Why are you telling me this? Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-- Ohh It's a holster. Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [Grunts] Ohh Oh, what a day. What a day. Dwight, are you carrying a gun? The holster was a gift from my great-uncle honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me. Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable. The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster. Why do you need to wear the holster at all? Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time? Thank you. You could put your cell phone in it instead. UhHello! You could put a banana in it. Why would I put a banana in my holster? In case you weren't hungry now but you got hungry later. Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo. Okay, all right, fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. - Sorry I freaked you guys out-- - Aah! Andy! Aah! God! It's so loud! Oh my God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that? Eeeeeee There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't-- Eeeeeeee.  Eeee  I can't find perfect c. Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, painting-- Hey, what happened? Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head. No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun. - [Off-key scatting] [Stammering] Something's definitely wrong. I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms? Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. [Buzzer] Firewall. I can't reach Jo-- She must already be on the plane. Why are you calling Jo? I think I should go to the hospital. - I'll go with you. - No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever. I'll take him. Thank you, Darryl. What's wrong with you? - It's my ear. - Yeah. Yes, sir. Oh. I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before. I'm gonna keep trying Jo. Okay, everyone-- Conference room. Right now! Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [Imitating gunfire] Howdy, partners. It's me, gun-safety Dwight. And I'm the rootin'est-- I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation. We all saw you do it. Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like? Navy blue. Little red anchors. I have no way of knowing if that's true. I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? Okay, really? Would you consider this a terrorist incident? - I felt terrorized. - Come on. Oh, there's a whole nother terrorism booklet for that. I just really, really think that we should handle this internally. Dwight, why is it on us to protect you? Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so So important to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best. - Hey. - [Gasps] - We're back. - There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here. Tell us your war stories. Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal. Did they say what caused it? 'Cause I know you like putting q-tips deep into your ear canal. Yeah. How's your hearing? Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying when we were in the waiting room. I was talking like this: [Mouthing words] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim, and it got to me. Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American idol audition. American idol? What? No. Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo? No.  Why did my temporary boss   go on a shooting spree?  Okay. Fine. You can go on your singing audition. Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. Pet day. I want pet day back-- No dogs. Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit. I put everything back in the vending machine. Put everything back in the vending machine exceptThe fruit. You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish. Okay. Oh, it's my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um You know what? I think I'm good. - Thank God. - Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough, can you do jazz hands? What's jazz hands? Fine. [Toilet flushes] What the fuck is that? Oh, my Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers. Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin? Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert-- The only man that ever turned me down. Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right? Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Coughs] Well, what can you do? Life. - We have to clean this up now! - She had so much-- - Hey, guys. - Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. [Both laughing] No! Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again? I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that. Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying - No, I was not. - And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is Between me and my diary. Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements? - Sure. - Hey, Dwight. Gimme a back massage. No, Kevin, come on. My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it. Kevin, not now. - Hey, Jo - Okay, okay. Shh! No. Under the jacket. You're kidding me. Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist. - I don't feel anything. - Oh, it's so wet. - Push harder, Dwight. - I can't. I can't push harder! - Go a little higher. - I-- [Grunts] There. There you go. Nope. Higher. I c-- Higher. - Oh, my God! - There we go. Okay. How's that? Knead it. Knead it like a pizza. - I'm kneading it! - But don't eat it. Okay Dwight. Walk me out. Oop. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it-- It's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel? Jo I accidentally fired a gun in the office today. - What? - I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted is to be manager here. And if you feel like you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse-- Shooting is worse! Are you kiddin' me? It's not even in the same-- You shot a gun? What is wrong with you? It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps. Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid. I take full responsibility. Who else would be responsible? Pam made me put a banana in my holster. You shot a gun off-- Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes. Stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. - Got it. - I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job. Jo, please - No. - I will-- No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement. You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty? - Yep. - Yep. Till then, we need a new actin' manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office? Uh, well, we probably don't wanna go just on seniority. Who is it? Hey, Dwight. What's up? Shut up. Okay. Well You do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But I will say In your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time, [slurps liquid] And I think that is shagadelic, baby. Four. One. Seven. One. Another one? - Yes! - Yes! Seven. - Two, six, - Could you turn down the beeping? nine, shut up Oscar, eight Nine first, put the nine. - Nine, eight, five, - Thank you. Three, zero, zero - Again, zero. - Okay. - Four, six - Nice. - Two, one. - I hit three, I head three instead of God!
It's a beautiful morning at Dunder Mifflin--  Or as I like to call it Great Bratton.  Keep it running.  Do I love being manager?  I love my kids. I love real estate.  I love ceramics. I love my job.  I-I love wrestling.  Find out what language this is.  Okay. Team building.  On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim,  Ted, Elroy.  On this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed  He never called a meeting.  BoBody. BoBody.  What does the first "b" stand for?  What are we doing?  We're making acronyms. Okay!  What does the first "b" stand for?  Business!  I like it!  Business.  Good, Kevin!  All right, the "o"  We need a new manager.   Your paper experience is very interesting.  Do you think you could use that experience  to inform decisions here?  Absolutely, I-- Yes.  In fact, I actually have a three-step plan  that I believe could effectively double your profits.  - Really? - Yeah.  What is it?  Nice try.  Uh I'm sorry.  W-what is your three-step plan?  Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan.  I mean, if you guys give me the job,  then-- Then you'll get the plan.  Welllt's an interview,  and we don't know that you really have the plan.  I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan.  I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it.  You're in paper, right?  How do we know that if you don't  You could just be saying it to get the job.  I guess I could be if I was  Who would do that?  How about this.  Why don't you give us a part of the plan,  and that way we know you have it.  Tell you what.  I'll give you part three of part two.  Not gonna give you a whole part.  Okay.  Color-code said document. TM.  - Did you just trademark that? - W-what?  That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.  We are the search committee  Hand-picked by our CEO  and tasked to find this branch's new manager.  Not everyone we meet will be good,  but someone's bound to be, right?  And to be honest,  I think a lot of the decent candidates  are right here in house.  So I'm not too worried.  But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time  with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis?  I had no idea.  Good morning.  - Morning. - Good morning.  Good morning.  Did you have a nice drive in?  I did.  I have a solid relationship with Jo,  the company's owner.  I have management experience.  I have a good friendship with Jim,  the head of the search committee.  And it doesn't hurt that I'm   Black!   It's good. I really hope you get it.  The manager job? Naw, I'm barely interested.  I just can't not go for it, you know.  It's not the Bernard way.  We give it the old college try,  and then in defeat, we show grace.  StillI'd really like to see this office  with you in the boss's chair.  Don't even  - You in the boss's chair! - Eeehhh! No.  In my family, you don't really go out and get things.  If you want something, you write it on a list  and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it  on wednesdays and Fridays.  SoI don't know.  I guess you could say this job is on my list and  We'll see what rosa comes back with.  Did you hear anything?  OhI'm sure they'll let us know  when they get the results.  It turns out that Erin was born  in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.  So Phyllis might be my mom.  I mean, the chances are tiny, but  Yeah. But probably not.  I mean, it was a big year for babies.  Porky's had come out. Yeah.  I'm sure I was just another porky's baby.  But why not find out? Yeah.  Should you really be so blatant about that?  They won't make me manager,  and I won't settle for anything less.  I've gone about as far as I can here.  That's obvious.  Time to take my talents elsewhere.  Are you really gonna apply for work  at Scranton Breadworks?  Bread is the paper of the food industry.  You write your sandwich on it.  Can you do any better on salary?  Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.  What about mileage when I use my car?  I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.  We think that  How 'bout 27 and, uh  When I make long-distance calls  will they be monitored, or is it on the honor system?  Okay.  How odd!  A very unusual phone call from the senator's office.  The senator wants me to have lunch with him  at the botanical gardens.  The botanical gardens  Scranton's hidden gem.  Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.  How will your experience selling refinery equipment  translate to our smaller scale here?  You don't work in sales, do you?  UhHuman resources.  You see, I sit across from a man  I see his face. I see his eyes.  Now, does it matter if he wants $100 of paper  or $100 million of deep-sea drilling equipment?  Don't be a fool.  He wants respect.  He wants love.  He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive.  There is no such thing  as a product.  Don't ever think there is.  Ere is only sex.  Everything is sex.  You understand that what I'm telling you  is a universal truth, Toby.  Yes.  Okay, I-I--  I amI'm almost a little concerned  that you might be overqualified for the position.  Do you, um Do you think that you are?  Do I look like someone who--  Who'd waste my own time?  No.  Can y--  You are a man of great confidence.  Could you speak a little more to that  and what the role of confidence  would be in a dialogue  with a subordinate?  Will you be heard?  Will you have a voice?  Will I steamroll over you?  Do you feel heard right now, Jim?  Do you have a voice right now?  You can answer me. Yes.  That was your choice, not mine.  The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller.  It is up to the object  Whether it will be flattened or not.  And I can tell just from the small interaction  we've had already,  you won't be flattened by anybody.  Do you agree with me, Jim?  - Yes. - Yes, you do.  He creeps me out.  But I think he might be a genius.  Good luck, Darryl.  Thank you.  Think about it.  What other mammal, besides humans,  drinks the milk of another mammal?  I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.  So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.  Oh. Uh, we haven't started the interview yet.  Were you-- Were you joking?  UhYes. I was.  Little joke.  So how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts  within the office?  I thought that was your job.  Well, it's one of my strengths,  but it's the manager's job.  Well, for instance, how did you deal with it  when two warehouse guys got into a fight?  I'll answer that, Jim.  I would use it as an opportunity to teach  Uh, about actions and consequences  of actions.  Who's that?  So I think all we need is a resume,  and we'll be good, right?  I-I just thought you knew me.  Yeah, it's no big deal.  Just something that looks like that.  Cool.  Let me  Cool.  Did, uh, you just interview?  Oh. Unfortunately, yes.  W-what do you mean?  That business can't attract anyone.  It's awful up there.  Those people seem like they're in prison  waiting out life sentences  in a Dying industry.  Place must be horrible.  I don't know if I want this job.  Well, if I get this job offer,  then I know that I'm gonna take it.  And if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit.  And then 25 years are gonna go by, and  I'm gonna die here.  What makes you feel qualified to judge a place  after a mere interview?  What are you doing?  Stop trying to figure me out.  - I just did. - You can't.  - It's done. - No, it's not.  I know you now. I know your nature.  You don't know me-- You don't know anything about me.  - I'm done. - Get out of my head.  - Not worth continuing. - Stop trying to figure me out.  Do you even know anything about paper?  How it's made?  I saw an episode on how they make paper  on sesame street.  Get out.  I'm gonna prevent inferior men  from sullying my place of work  with their weak, passionless leadership.  Do you see my hat? No?  That's because I just threw it in the ring.  You guys pay for relocation, though, right?  Well, why would you need relocation  if you already live in Scranton?  Well, I'd wanna move further away, you know?  JustDon't want any chance  of running into my coworkers outside the office.  Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?  I'm leaving my other job  because they were all Jerks.  Really. You know, all of them.  You had your jerk wads and your jerk offs, so  Just between the wads and the offs,  I just-- I had to get outta there.  Is this a bad time to be doing this?  I'm having a bad time.  I'm sorry.  I-if we did something to upset you,  I-I'm sure it was inadvertent.  Wait.  Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby?  These are the nicest people I ever met.  Thank you.  It's gorgeous, Angela.  Yeah, I actually know about nice rings,  and it is gorgeous. OhWow.  It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I  Naomi judd?  - Tell us the freaking story! - Yeah, tell us the story.  Okay. He took me to the replica  of Monet's Japanese bridge.  And then he put this flower behind my ear,  which normally I would hate,  'cause it's so civil rightsy.  Then he got down on one knee and he said,  "will you be a senator's wife?"  Oh! He talked about himself in the third person?  Yes, Pam.  Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim.  "Oh, hey, Pam, dude, whatever.  Wanna marry me?"  That's not accurate.  Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there.  They always find us. And everyone was crying.  Even his aide.  Angela's engaged to a gay man.  As a gay man, I'm horrified.  As a friend of Angela's, horrified.  As a lover of elegant weddings,  I'm a little excited.  But overall, horrified.  Andy?  You all set?  Okay, guys. It's time.  It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.  Are you sure this is a good idea?  I hate to see you disappointed.  I think Andy should be the boss.  He's just so great.  If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.  So Andy, what improvements would you make  as office manager? For starters, I really think  we can streamline communication around here.  Whoa. That's a very heavy accusation  to level against Toby.  - I wasn't a-accusing-- - Well, Toby's in charge  of human resources.  That would include communication.  I think that Toby's done a fine job.  Right. I-I-I really wasn't trying to insult a-anyone.  I didn't think you were.  I have two relationships with Andy.  I have a personal relationship,  and I have a professional relationship.  Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat  and I think he's responsible  for the demise of my relationship with Erin.  Professionally  He broke up the happiest couple in this office.  How many windows are there in New York City?  - What? - Critical thinking.  Common on-the-spot question asked in an interview.  Okay. UhLet me think. Are you counting car windows?  No. How far away is the sun?  Uh, 93 million Miles.  - Is it? - Yeah.  And the diameter of the sun is 870,000 miles,  which makes it 109 times wider than the earth  and 333,000 times heavier than the earth.  Shut up about the sun.  Shut up about the sun!  I am unhappy with the confusing  and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting.  I wanted it to go better.  I wanted it to go better!  Yes, there used to be a paper clip  that would pop up and say,  "looks like you are writing a letter or resume.  Would you like help?"  I believe his name was Clippy.  First of all, I wanna thank you  for your years of patronizing our company.  I've got some bad news.  We're going out of business.  Saving face.  Yep, yep.  I understand that.  Basically everything's falling apart here.  How is this on me?  Hang up.  Corporate needs you to find the differences  between this picture and this picture.  Intel has told us there are at least seven.  Okay. I already see one. Gimme.  Okay.  They're the same picture.  Well, I manage my department,  and I've been doing that for several years now.  And, God, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.  Your department's just you, right?  Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.  Great. Um, can we just  - What was that? - We just have  a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so  Am I not a serious candidate?  What do you want me to say?  I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there.  We have a video CV from England.  Are we all just gonna pretend to--  okay. Um  What are your weaknesses?  I don't have any, asshole.  I want an interview.  How's the family? Good.  - Good? Are they good? - Yeah.  What's your daughter's name again?  Peepee?  - Peepa. - Peepa. How is she?  - Great. - Great!  Oh, that's great.  We never were very good at smalltalk, were we, Jim?  - No. - Now, listen--  You're not getting an interview, Dwight.  The whole point of this search committee process  is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.  Okay. I know why you're saying that, Jim.  I really do. But think of it this way.  The hand that reaches from the grave  to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel.  - Okay. That's vivid. - Now, I'm gonna make you  an offer, okay?  You even do so little as grant me an interview,  I will guarantee you your dream work life, okay?  You roll in at 10:00 AM  to your own private reserved parking spot,  pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's caffeine corner,  unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam.  - Yikes. - Erin will eat garbage  for your entertainment.  Wow. You know how I like taking bribes.  - Ha ha! - But unfortunately,  jo also took the job away from you  because she doesn't trust your judgment.  So how would that look for me  if I recommended you?  Fine.  I'll do it without you. You'll regret this.  Okay.  Let me get that for you.  - Thank you. - Okay.  Pam, I think Robert is gay.  The senator?  He was married before, and he has a kid.  - So-- - And don't say that thing  about how lots of gay guys have kids.  I have a very strong suspicion.  Did you see him at a bathhouse?  What bathhouse?  The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.  What?  Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.  My friend at the Scranton blade  is totally plugged into these matters.  You're in the gay mafia.  You're thinking of another group--  Much wealthier, much older. You sound ignorant.  You guys, um Talking senator?  - No. - No.  Why would we be talking about the senator?  'Cause he's totally gay.  How do I know that Robert is gay?  He "liked" my Facebook photos  at 3:00 in the morning.  Name-- David Brent. Occupation-- Inspirer.  Status-- None of your business.  Young, free, and single, though.  Thanks for asking.  Hey, you're looking for a new boss, yeah?  Someone to tell a bunch of discontented,  under-encouraged drones what to do every day.  Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be.  Want me to fire them? They don't see things your way?  Then I am that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.  Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law.  What? You've changed your mind?  You're now looking for a leader of men?  Ipso factoWomen too.  When do I start?  Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me?  I waited in his office every morning  wearing nothing but kitty cat ears.  I did that every day for two weeks.  And on the tenth day, he walked in.  He was naked too, except a dog nose.  - Guess what we did then? - I don't think I can do that--  - Bestiality. - Yeah.  That's not my personality.  If my daughter were asking me  Yes?  I would say if you want someone--  If you really want them--  Go get them.  I do really want him.  So, uh Here you go.  - Great. - Hope it's all right.  I'm sure it's fine.  The guy who was in here earlier,  interviewed after me How'd he do?  Howard cline?  That's not who I'm talking about.  Oh. Deshaun Williams.  Yes. How did he do?  He's an amazing man. He's a rhodes scholar.  He invented an app that invents apps.  Fantastic kisser.  Common, man. I'm being serious.  It's no joke. Darryl, we all know you.  Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guy's.  First I'll take down  - the cubicle walls. - But there aren't--  Symbol of transparency.  There'd be no titles.  Everyone has the same job.  Same goes for me.  I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.  A little unspecific.  Everyone would be known  for their accomplishments.  That's very interesting.  UmI feel like there might be a conflict there,  and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?  Oh! Yeah.  Scratch everything from before.  I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way.  More cubicles.  More division.  Everyone is somebody's boss,  and that person can fire the person below them.  And once a month the lowest-performing person--  Bye-bye.  How would you compare like an accountant and HR?  Well, I'll tell you how, shall I?  I'll tell you how. Okay.  By splitting the difference.  Just--just somewhere in the middle.  I think that's probably all  We need to hear from--  Zen office.  Thought of that? That's what I'd do.  Everyone takes their shoes off before they come in, okay?  There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.  - That's very-- - You've got a thai woman  out in the back-- Sockee.  - Okay. - Sockee.  - That's not-- - Sockee is her name, okay?  She's administering massage, all right, if you need it.  If you don't, whatever. Just talk to her.  She's a person.  Either way, 50 minutes of that,  and you  You are cracking to go.  - Is there a frontrunner? - You know what?  They all just sort of blend together after a while.  Well, there must be someone who stands out.  No, not at all.  In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously.  I think at the end of the day,  I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.  The hell you will!  I worked for the last boss for 15 years.  According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years  if I wanna keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle,  which I intend to.  Oh, no, Stanley. You'll live forever.  My next boss will be my last boss.  He'll be at my funeral.  So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously.  You pick a crappy boss,  you're responsible for my crappy life.  Okay, everybody. I was just making a joke.  I am taking it seriously. I promise.  Are you?  Little advice?  Take a day off from the whole Jim shtick.  Try caring about something.  You might like how it feels, James.  Hey, honey. Oh, lord. Take all this.  - All right. - Here.  - Oh. - Jim.  Did you hear stern this morning?  - No. Was he good? - AhRobin was good.  She's always good. Keeps him on his toes.  It's Howard's show, though.  Whose is this?  Darryl Philbin.  Oh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top.  Ah, a little long, aren't we? Four pages?  Is this the same Darryl Philbin  who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?  Yes, thanks to you who promoted me  after we, uhlnterfaced.  "Coordinated and implemented receipt, storage,  and delivery of over    Paper material, ma'am.  Paper material?  Pieces of paper.  Jo. May I speak to you for a second?  Or what? You gonna shoot me?  Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha  Oh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes.  Because I've learned so much from them.  I'd like to be interviewed for the position.  I'll interview you right now.  - Okay. - Question one.  Ever shot a gun in the office?  It's complicated  Yeah, but seelt's not.  I don't think we should tell her.  Angela went a whole day without telling me  I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.  I'm a woman. I would want to know.  Yeah. You gotta know.  Okay. But if Angela can get a gay man to marry her,  maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me. Huh?  Huh? Huh? That's hot.  You have met a lesbian in real life, right?  You know, this probably is her last chance at a family.  She does seem happy.  You're right. You're right.  She seems happy. We don't tell her.  - We don't tell her. - Okay.  Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?  Okay.  UhCan it be in private?  Don't worry. It's not about you.  As minority executive,  I think it's my responsibility to let you know  that Gabe is gross.  I don't think it's professional  that he was sleeping with the receptionist,  and then when Erin dumped him so that she could be with Andy,  he became a total crazy stalker psycho.  Welcome to Scranton, Jo,  land of a thousand problems only you can fix.  Oh, for God's sake.  He's texting me his resume one line at a time.  These are costing me  I'm roaming!  Get me our biggest client on the phone  right this instant.  Who is our biggest client?  Uh, just put him through to me.  Okay.  Hello, this is The client.  It's Creed.  Fyi. I'm starting my own paper company.  Looking to poach some chumps. You in?  - Yes. - Cool!  Let's keep this on the qt, okay?  I, uh, don't want you to be a dead mammajamma.  - Great. - All right, thank you.  - Thank you. Bye-bye.  Jo, you have one more candidate.  He's a burn victim.  He's all messed up.  I can tell him to get lost if you want.  No. Send him in.  Who is this?  - I have no idea. - Oh, I know this guy.  Hello, Mr. Souvenier.  Mr. Jacques Souvenier?  Nice to meet you. It says here you're French?  So you worked at your last job for 15 years  as assistant to the regional manager.  Assistant regional manager.  Assistant to the regional manager.  - Assistant regional manager. - What is it?  Assistant regional manager.  Oh. That's my mistake. Sorry about that.  The last paper company you worked for  burned to the ground?  "All because they wouldn't hire a manager  who lived and breathed paper."  That's a travesty.  I wanna talk to Dwight Schrute for a second.  I wanna ask him a question.  Get Dwight.  If he isn't here in 60 seconds  Wait, wait! No. Stop, stop.  Jo  It's me. I'm Dwight.  No.  No. Wait. But--  I mean, you're Dwight and then  He's the--  Yeah.  Very unprofessional, Jacques.  Or should I say Dwight?  Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenier.  Then what?  I would have dressed this way every day,  legally changed my name, learned French sign language,  shown up, and been the best damn branch manager  you'd ever seen.  All that for this job.  Yes.  That's [Bleep] Crazy.  Get outta here.  What a nut job.  This guy was good, although he did keep saying  that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning  for a trip to the Finger Lakes.  Seriously, every five minutes he was like,  "hey, just making sure the Finger Lakes thing is clear."  Okay. It's fun to talk about the rejects,  but, uh Who's got ya excited?  Finger Lakes guy is good.  Darryl is also very good.  Who's this fellow? Went to Cornell.  What's wrong with him? How much time do you have?  Sales ability--none.  See sales ability.  And that's your unbiased opinion.  - Yes, it is. - So it's not relevant  that he took the receptionist away from ya.  Aw, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you.  Some people let personal things into the work--  is she with him? Because I-I thought that--  - Gabe! Ohh!  You got all close to these people,  got involved in their lives.  Let's get ya back to Florida.  We'll figure out something for ya.  That sounds like a promotion.  It's not.  Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.  UmWhy Kelly?  'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong.  I'm doing an opposites thing.  Okay.  How'd my girl Nelly do?  Oh. I didn't know you knew her.  - She didn't mention it? - No.  Integrity move. I like it.  Yeah, uh, she also gave me reason to think  that maybe she wasn't a good fit.  Well, I'm not saying you must hire her.  If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine.  Just make sure they fit real good.  No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim.  And give Dwight an interview.  I like a little bit of crazy.  - Ah! - Erin, what are you doing?  I've been turned into a puppet.  Okay.  Look at the puppet. Hi, puppet.  Who are you?  I went to drop off the FedEx forms,  and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!  Yeah.  Low blow, puppet.  And there's only one thing that can change me back  into a real girl.  It's good.  It's just that I wish the puppet  would talk more about the alphabet.  Not for me, but  If any kids are watching.  A, b, and so forth.  You know.  M, N, L, O. P.  F.  I need the most special thing in the office.  Silence?  A date with the best salesman  Andy Bernard!  Hey, Erin. Oh.  Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?  - I've done it all my life-- - Listen, I'm really flattered,  but I don't think we should.  Erin's my best friend in this office,  hands down.  But  When she asked me out,  I just didn't have that feeling, you know?  Aren't there some things that you really want to like  but you just can't seem to like it?  Like madmen or football.  Let's not forget. Erin chose Gabe over me.  That happened.  I'm not gonna apologize for getting over herOkay?  I'm sorry.  I would go for someone who's more  She's great, though.  Stanley, I won't be able to invite  everyone to the wedding,  because we wanna keep it to 350.  - I'll get over it. - I mean,  we just have to see how many senators  and members of congress want to attend  before we can open it up to regular people.  Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding?  Do you still have the plans  for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?  That was our dream wedding.  Niagara falls?  Pregnant? That was your dream?  Pork medallions?  I hope  You have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.  All right.  Name. Dwight Schrute.  Thank you, Mr. Scnoot. We will let you know.  - You have to interview me. - I just did.  The answer to that one question  told me everything I need to know.  I demand more questions!  All right, guys. Good day.  A lot of candidates. Let's discuss.  Okay. If you're not gonna interview me,  then I'll do it. Yes.  What will be your first priority?  I will have seven first priorities.  Safety, profits,  fostering a community of self-reliance  and entrepreneurship,  listening,  respect for human life,  bolstering our public image,  and Getting everyone home on time.  Dwight, let me be Frank.  In an accident that no one can blame you for,  an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager.  How are we ever to trust you again?  That's a great question.  I am going to institute  a strict no firearms policy for this office  that extends to myself as well.  Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.  - Thank you, Dwight. - Thank you.  You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute,  and I think you're going to like the call  you're going to receive.  Oh, come on.  I'm just happy that I got this meeting.  Well, that was quick.  Very, very interesting.  And you know what? I'm impressed.  - He's not a real candidate. - I don't know, Jim,  'cause it makes me think about something  that my grandfather used to say, which is that  sometimes the hand that jumps out of the grave  and grabs you around the throat,  that is the hand that you want on the wheel.  - You took the deal. - Yeah. It was a great deal.  - That's not okay. - I don't know.  Dwight seems like a great leader to me,  and I look forward to the personal perks  that he promised me privately.  What do you think, Toby?  Well, we could try him out for a little while.  If it doesn't work out, you know,  maybe one of us could, you know, step in  What is happening right now?  Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?  No. Why would you think that?  Well, he and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.  Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know,  no decision has been made.  And Dwight is definitely not the boss.  That is correct.  Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.  No, no, no, not-- Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.  Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it?  Seems to me like someone is getting a little power mad.  Am I the only one who remembers  what he did when he was in charge?  I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.  Tuna You're completely sane.  - Thank you. - Who do you like for the job?  Is there anyone who maybe  was a little underwhelming at first  but now seems like a safe  If not slightly unexciting choice?  Okay. It seems like everybody has an opinion, so who else?  Anybody? Do you mean it?  Anybody? Are you sure?  I suppose I am.  Okay. Well, what do I want in a manager?  Let me see.  What do I want?  I don't think he meant--  So now anyone gets to talk at any time?  Go ahead.  What do I want?  I'm looking for someone  who  Everyone is listening to me.  - Can I say-- - Yes.  I think it should be Darryl.  - Okay. - What a surprise.  Minorities sticking together. Kelly's on your side.  I'm sorry, is that all you think of me-- A minority?  I am so much more than that.  I am a dancer. I'm a singer.  I'm a fashion designer.  Whoever it is, I think they should be lame.  Kind of a nonthreatening, moderate personality.  - I want an outsider. - Perfect.  There are several outside candidates that we think--  No, I mean an outsider.  Like someone on the margins of society  who doesn't see things the way we do,  like a homeless person. A homeless person.  Really? A homeless person.  No. You're right, Pam.  Let's just leave them to the welfare system  and let that handle it. No, I want you to say  that you think the best person to be our new manager  is a homeless person.  Let me guess who you want, Pam.  Rachael ray? The ladies of the view?  I got away with everything under the last boss,  and it wasn't good for me at all.  So I want guidance. I want leadership.  But don't just like boss me around, you know?  Like lead me.  Lead me When I'm in the mood  to be led.  I just want for once  a small, professional, decisive,  well-hung man in his 40s.  - Hey, hey, hey! - Okay, fine.  Uh, the guy with a tiny penis.  Are you happy? Let's hire that guy!  She may have a point there.  Would a small penis work?  Small to moderate.  Gotta catch a plane.  Oh, hey, Gabe, I'm sorry.  We didn't get you a cake or anything.  We're gonna miss you.  Oh, well, I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.  You are not leaving without giving me a hug.  Ugh! Okay, you know what?  You don't need to make that sound.  I'm sorry. You were just a lot bonier  than I thought you were gonna be!  There are plenty of people who love touching me.  I'm a terrific hugger.  I've been with a bunch of girls  where that's basically all they wanna do.  I will see you all soon. Later, man.  - Good luck. - We'll miss you.  Good luck at your new job.  Uh, listen up.  Listen up, ladies.  I want the job.  There. I said it.  I'm educated. I'm capable.  I like all of you, and I won't make any changes.  I see it.  I see it like I see a Mountain that I'm standing in front of  and facing and I'm liking.  Yeah.  Andy would be wonderful as boss.  Erin made a good point.  No. We're not related. I got the call.  But I'll tell her some other day.  What about Darryl?  We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?  Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself  and not myself and the senator.  I think we have some wonderful candidates,  and there is a great lively debate here.  But let's think about-- - No. No.  No. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing.  You have to have something to say if you talk.  Exactly.  Jada. No, no, no. Jada, what are you do--  Oh. So sorry, guys.  I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.  Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?  Maybe, sweetheart.  Single dad. Challenges.  I don't know if he'd be a good manager,  but he's a really great dad.  Okay. Shush. This was a mistake.  Let's go.  It seems like we all know enough to vote.  Should just vote now? What? No, no, no.  It's not a vote. Then what was this all about?  I don't know.  This conversation really got away from me.  I don't care. They can just vote.  No, they can't.  That's not how this is gonna work.  We're going in this room.  We're gonna have a meeting.  We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo,  and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday, okay?  What the hell happened out there?  Sometimes you hear people talking about failing upwards.  I think I'm about to do that.  This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it.  Jo's an old friend.  I think M her best friend.  She's not my best friend.  Every day, I have a blueberry muffin.  Today I did not have a blueberry muffin.  Should have had the blueberry muffin.  Especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.  No. I've never been more sure of anything in my life.  I will be the new boss of  Vance refrigeration.  Honestly, I think I-- I sabotaged myself.  It's like I'm afraid of being happy.  Case in point  I was supposed to start another job today.  I will get offered the job.  That's aCall I've received many times.  The slight Hopefulness in their voice,  the pregnant pause while they  Wait to hear my response.  And then My response.  I want the job.  I really do.  It's just the rest of my family's  in the Finger Lakes right now.  I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now.  I told 'em I was on a hike, snuck away to do this interview.  I gotta get back pretty soon. They'll worry.  People disappear in the Finger Lakes.  I will run this branch  or I will destroy this branch.  OrI don't know.  Something always works out.   You remind me so much of my fourth biggest client.  Is that right?  I think you two should meet.  Well, okay  Hey, Jordana, patch my ninth  and my fourth biggest client together.  Hello? Hello!  Hi, how are ya? Oh, I'm good!  Don't you just love paper and things about paper?  Hey! Are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!
Oh, for God's sake. "Planking" is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically you lie like a plank in weird places. That's it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet. Planking is one of those things where, hey, you either get it or you don't. And I don't. But I am so excited to be a part of it. - After you, my good sir. - No, I insist. The search committee finally decided after a lot of deliberation on Robert California for the manager position Who took one look around and left. He drove down to Florida and convinced Jo to make him CEO. CEO Her own job. He talked her out of her own job and I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill and he chose It's unbelievable. True, I might have been the second choice, but I was the first choice's first choice. And, about Dwight, I sense that he might have some resentment about not getting the job. So I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, "I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer." Smart, right? Very smart. - This has got to stop. - I can't get down. Ke Kevin! Yeah, at first I was really disappointed. But I've got a great daily routine going right now. I've upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing, lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week, krav maga four times a week, an hour of meditation every morning at sunrise, and again at sunset. So yeah I'm doing great. Okay, I'm going to need some help. Pam? I don't think I should. Oh, yeah, pregnant. Right here. Little Michael Scott. Nope. I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy We found out early. Much different the second time around. And I have to say, it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office. Look! It's, uh, little pregs and big pregs. Wait, when did we start calling Isn't it amazing, the difference in our sizes? Well, I am a few months ahead of you. I'm having a child with my husband the senator, and Pam is having a child with Jim The great salesman. Hoist him aloft! Come on, Darryl! Lift, lift, Darryl. Yeah, come on, man Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got something much better This soda. This is mine. It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt. I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I'm telling someone how to do something. I go on with a long description and then I say, "and shove it up your butt!" It's stupid, but it's my thing now. No one should be planking at all. Thank you. Yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this? Say no more. Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. Especially with me around.  Trouble   Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble  Are you watching that commercial again? Why do you keep watching it if you know it's just going to make you cry? Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? And this dog He just wants to protect his bone. He's got a bank vault, that's a start. Not enough, though. All right. The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's going to zero in on for these really intense small talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet you hope it is you too. It's strange. Here we go. - Hello. - Robert California. Let's have a conversation. Describe your day so far. Well, I woke up, and Erin, when you recount your day, never say you woke up, it's a waste of your time. That's how every day has begun for everyone since the dawn of man. Very smart. Very smart. Suddenly I was awake. - And I have a new thing - Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30 A.M. Casual chitchat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning. First item on the agenda Can I get everyone an extra long Columbus day weekend? Item number two Connect with the guy. Robert California What does he think of me? Don't know. Super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client. Uh, nope, I actually have that on last month's order. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah on that. Pam! Pam! Psst! Pam! Come here. - Look - Jim! Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. Okay. What is this? The Friday before Columbus day Thoughts? What are your thoughts? Just making chitchat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no? See? I think that What are you looking at? It's it's nothing. - Can't be nothing. - Yeah, it can't be nothing. It's just a list of our names split into two columns. What? Okay, just wait one second, all right? I will copy it. Do you have a pen? - No. - No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone? Nice catch. If he comes out, distract him. We need a warning signal. We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. I can see him right there. We do! - I promise you, we don't need - Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Phyllis! - Oh. - You okay? Here, watch your neck. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. Oh! Thanks, guys. Wow. Okay. What side of the list am I on? - Left. - Yes! Why are you How do you know Really great list of names, guys. Thank you so much. Good work. Uh, no. Actually, that was in Robert's notebook. He left it at reception and we photocopied it. O-oo-kay. I don't want any part of this. Maybe it's a list of people he's going to fire. Okay, it's not that, Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make. This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. And this is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in alive situation. No. That can't be it. I got to say, kind of seems like the left side's the side to be on me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense, Pam. - No, I don't think so. - Excuse me? Shh! Pam, come on. Don't be such a right-sider. - Did you guys figure it out? - We couldn't crack it. Go in there and just ask the man what it means. He'll know that we looked at his private notebook. Come on, just say you saw the list by accident. I'm already working on this Columbus day thing for you guys. And it's starting to stack up feels like a lot. One thing at a time. That's all you had to do today, is ask about Columbus day? Yes for God's sake, Andy yes, come in. What's up? Weird thing Totally awkward But you left your notebook on the reception desk Great. Thank you. And It was open And people saw this, and they're just kind of going nuts, and like - What is this? - Wondering what it is. It's a photocopy from your notebook. You read my notebook, and and photocopied it, and distributed it. No. They did, and they asked me to ask about it. Please. Here's what it is. It's a doodle. What? Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises Funny how the houses are always colonials, and the penises are always circumcised, don't you think? Well, I doodle too. But I'm not an artist, so I draw words and lists. That is fascinating. And by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of Did you just move my name? Might as well have been sketching a cube. Okay. Everybody think, quick. What do these groups have in common? Maybe we're supposed to do it with people in our group. That's not it. - People in the other group? - Mm-mm. Still wrong. Stanley, you do puzzles all day. What do we got? Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add 'em all up, and shove it up your butt! - Thank you. A little much-needed comic relief. But we really need to figure this out, guys. I know! It's alphabetical. No. No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up, and compare the line, see if we learn anything, okay? Left-siders, over here. Right-siders line up over here. Face each other. Match up by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here, and left side of the list Attack! Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Will you stop? Dwight! Dwight! Go for it! Stop, stop. Warning! Warning! Warning! I'd like to invite the following people to join me for lunch Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar. That's great! Let's do this, guys! All right. Well, I will see you in a bit. I love you so much. Hey, it's nothing, all right? Text you when we get there and let you know what's going on. - Okay. - No. No dog video. - Okay. - Okay. See you guys. Well, we should all be really excited about our Very own pizza party. Pizza party!  Pizza party   pizza party  Jim, your daughter Cecilia What does she think of the street? - Uh, the street? - Sesame Street. Oh! I didn't know anybody called She likes it a lot. She, uh, loves elmo. Elmo. God save us The Elmo era. - Right? - Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. The complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn't you agree? Yeah. She does like elmo. "Cultural ghetto"? Totally, totally agree. - Completely. - Apt. Apt analysis, Robert. The thing that I like about elmo is the tickling. I should not be here. I'm in the I was in the wrong I'mI'm sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I-I was never here. - Great group! Pizza party! - How is this a pizza party? Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here? Yeah, well that's just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party. Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza? - What's that? - Fresh tomato, with a dollop of mozzarella cheese. - That's pizza. - That's regular pizza. You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question. What made you pick This group? I just think you guys are winners, and I wanted to have lunch with you. Okay. Aww. Well, what about the other guys? - Losers? Come on. - Oh, come on. - Come on, come on. - No. Well I guess I think they're losers. Ah, I knew it. Yes! Probably shouldn't have said that. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Aha-oo! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched. Oh, text from Jim. "This is getting very weird. Will explain later." Oh, text from Kevin. "Suck it, losers." Okay, now clearing the obvious, but doesn't the fact that I'm in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh, this crust is sharp! I used to be young and cute and sort of funny, and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like "Who's that receptionist? I like her." Now I'm just a fat mom. Yeah. And you take one look at me and you're like, "oh, loser." Come here, Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously. Oh. Oh, God. Oh! Hey, guys, we had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out and got to know each other better. How was your lunch? - It was excellent. - Good times. - Yeah? Yeah? - Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too, Andy. I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me my parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors everyone. Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Just just take the take the casserole out of the - Loser. - Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. Uh, it'll be fine. Just leave it in for 20 minutes. - Loser. - Losers. When I was a salesman, I could just be like, "not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to Polish my knob." Metaphorically, of course. But now It is my job, and my prob. Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please? It's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier, and others would be Second-tier. - I never said that. Thank you. Great. I said "winners" and "losers." Is that what you're talking about? Oh, that might that actually might be What I'm thinking of. - Can you clarify that? - Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, honesty. I'll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues, and then inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you're a winner. If I didn't, I don't. But I just met you all. Life is long. Opinions change. Winners, prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong. Whew! Well, I guess that's that. No. No, no. Andy, don't go in there! I'm going in there. I know that every time I talk to you, things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. SoPlease take this pen and change your list. I'm not going to change my list, Andy, and I don't use ballpoint pens. Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley You may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships? I did not know about the sales figures. Meredith Palmer, supplier relations The word "no," not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair, you had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is Astute. Good call. Pam Easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with. Jim, shut the door. This is just gross. Shh! Erin Hannon The receptionist and my closest confidante a winner if there ever was one. I like my new group. I liked my old group. - Are we done? - Yes. No. The Friday before Columbus day we're going to take a half-day so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend. You want a 3 1/2 day weekend for Columbus day. Yes, I do. And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of native Americans. I don't care. Hey, guys! So Columbus day We got that half-day on Friday. We get that every year. Well, you got it this year too. - Good night, Andy. - Good night. Good-bye. Good night, Andy. - Good night. - Good night. All right, I'm going to go warm up the car. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something! Jim! Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No. It's wonderful. I'm gonna frame it. I can always unframe.
Hey, so this isn't matching up with this. So I'm not sure which one is right. Can you just hand down the original for me. - Yes, me do. - All right. Hey, what were you saying before about the paperwork? Me doing now! Go. Stop worry. Kevin, do you feel okay? Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night. Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital. Yeah, all right, Kevin. Why don't you come with us? - No, no, guys. - No, he's fine. - He's always been like that. - No, he hasn't. I mean, he's gotten worse over the years, but He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin. You keep think that. Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say, "car no go," and we best friends. So me think, why waste time say lot word when few word do trick? Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do. Thank. Here, we have a word code. The same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is basically the speech equivalent to just wearing underpants. Sometimes, words you no need use but need-need for talk-talk. But save time. More success. Does it save time, though? 'Cause we've been here for about an hour. No me fault. Kevin At most, you're saving a microscopic amount of time. Many small time make big time. And what are you gonna do with all this time? See world. Kevin, you can't possibly save enough time to see the world. Kevin, are you saying, "see the world" or "seaworld"? See world. Oceans, fish, jump. China. No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. 'Cause I still don't know if you're saying seaworld or see the world, and it's taking a lot of time to explain it. Fine. Fine. I'll talk normally. When me president, they see. They see. This week, we are rolling out the brand-new sabre tablet The pyramid. Ooh, why is it shaped like that? So you can tell your clients, "unleash the power of the pyramid." It's huge. How much does it weigh? Oh, no, no, no. Without the battery pack and the optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds. How much memory does it have without the booster? - I'm sorry, "L"? - Mm-hmm. How many "L" to a "K"? You're really gonna want the booster. How on Earth are we supposed to sell-- I'll take five. Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing. Oh, no, no, no, no. This is Dwight's meeting. - Thank you, the-- - I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert's gonna like more? What do you think, c-span? C-span? Yeah C-span. Cocker spaniel. Spaniel 'cause of your Spanish bloodline, cocker 'cause Is this really the best use of our collective time? I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax, okay? I'm sorry to hijack your meeting, d-dub-dog. Had to pull rank. Okay. Let's look at some ties. Here's how I'm gonna help out from now on. I'm going to not care. And I'm gonna sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise. Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night. Um, D-dog, you have a message. Erin, you don't need to call him that. Andy wants us to, P-dog. It's okay, E-dog. Just who called? Justine. She said she's coming by later. Your ex-wife? Wait, I thought she was a [Bleep] And you [Bleep] hated her guts. - Kevin - Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. I like her. Well, I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman. No, man. We get along now. Real well. Wow. All right. Can't wait to meet her. I'll introduce you. Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night, we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex-wife last night. I have to sing it.  We took a shower   we were naked   we   scap dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  Hi, dad. Ah--ohh. Oh, boy. Hello, Andy. Excellent tie. Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here? I'd love some coffee. I was looking over your projections, and I think we can to better. Are you factoring in the whole national economy Declining and all that? Andy, do you know why I chose you? I think I can sum up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor. Vanilla. Valla? No, no. You'll never guess in a million, billion years, you'll never guess. You were saying you chose me. There was a reason. Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set? Can I inspire? I don't know! I don't know. Oh, thank you. - Oh, uh-- - Oh, sorry. Here, just put it down. Oh. Mm. Ah. That is very cold. Yeah, it's old. Why would I-- I asked if you wanted a cold beverage, and you said coffee. Why don't we get Robert a nice, hot, fresh cup, and I will have this. Andy, you don't want that. I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. Mmm. Sorry. You like her. I-I do. Yeah. She likes you. You know, we've both been into each other at different times, and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance-- I'm afraid you've lost my interest. Let me call you back. I gotta go. If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here? Yeah. This is where we go. You'd go someplace else. That's not it. That's not the answer. - It's a answer. - It's a wrong answer. - There are no wrong answers. - Take a look at where you are. Where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at its birth. The superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why? WaitThey're terrified? Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want, I go on the Internet and get the best price. Or I don't know what I want, and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them, "you are welcome." Ah, thank you. Ooh! Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it. You got it. - Double. - Done. - I'm not kidding. - Neither am I. It's already done. Ha. I'm just kidding. - It's gonna take some time. - Double. Hey. Hey What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business, see how things are going. Well, you start. If no one else wants to. I was just thinking about Robert. Man, what a boss. JustThrows down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling project going? How are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button. Of course not. There's no magic button. You have to Summon that. If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making sense. He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads, any new territories you want us to look into, maybe have an in with a big client that we could get our foot in the door? Dwight, anything? We could talk about how fast children grow up. And before you know it, they're out of the house. You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like? What would it be? Tuna. New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door. Fart. Good sesh. That leg's asleep. Hello. I'm looking for a Darryl Philbin. Don't-- Oh You must think-- I'm not. I'm using the fax. This isn't-- No, wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company, right? There's usually an Erin here. - Okay. - So Darryl! A girl!  Rub a dub dub   with the apricot scrub  What's up, darling? Hey, everybody, this is justine. - Hello. - Hi, justine. - Hi. - This is Jim and Oscar. Hi. Everybody. Hello. Kevin. Can we go someplace private? Follow me. I got a space. After you. I been thinking about you all morning. I don't know what you did. I can barely walk today. D-bone. There you are. Let me guess. Somebody needs a brownie! Lick the spoon? No, that's okay. I just-- I wanted to ask you about Is this about the profits? Because if it is, I just don't see the point. It's so wall street. - I know, right? - Right? - Yeah. - Ha. Um How is everything? Good. Really, really good. Must be a tough time to be a family farm. Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salad, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back. Oof. What are you gonna do about that? I don't know. What do you mean? Gotta be some way you could double your beet sales. You wanted the job. The job is yours. Just do the job. And I'llDo mine. Walnuts? No! Have you seen this? Parenting? Yeah. This is Cece's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies. She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces-- - Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue? I flipped through it. So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant. - Of course, yeah. - Everyone knows that. I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me? That sounds nice. Great. You have a walking buddy. I do! - Thanks for coming in, guys. - You don't have to thank us for coming in-- It's our job. Well, I never got thanked for coming into a meeting, and I always wanted to be, so I'm gonna thank people. What's under the blanket? This is what's under the blanket. WeDon't get it. These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves, "well, how does this work?" Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points and then we redeem those points for prizes. You're exactly right, and you get a point. - Oh! - Is that a vibrator? - 20 points. - How does one get a point? I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders. But basically You do your job better, you get points. So Collect 15 points, and redeem them for this polar bear. Why is it all kids' stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross. There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works. Or you can pool your points and redeem 55 for this maternity shirt. How about you want us to work harder, pay us more? I can't. This point system is really insulting. Ooh. Well, I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me, because I'm very, very Sari. It's a tablecloth. What if went all the way up to 500 points? That's a crazy amount of points. - But what if? - Well, what do you want? I don't know. For such a crazy number, I'd like something pretty crazy. All right. For 500 points, I will wear a dress to work. Ah! That's pretty good. What about, uh, for I'll run naked through the parking lot with a doughnut on my dingdong. Yeah? You like that? All right, for 5,000 points, I willLet you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard. - Oh! - Here we go! All right, all right, and you are totally serious. Swear to God, hope to die. Now, let's get to work! Wait. But you did say we could pool our points, right? In that case, let's get to work. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Whoo! All right, thank you very much. Uh, Phyllis, brachen auto? Ask for Donald. Karen's bananas. I just want you to benefit from our T-bag-bone. Andrew. Have you noticed just a little bit of a mood shift around here? No, I haven't noticed anything. Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years, and this is naptime. - Yeah? - Open-eye naptime. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him. You've got to unleash the power of the pyramid. I don't know what to tell you, man. You think it has something to do with that incentive program? Oh, 100%. We all want to see you tattoo your ass. Uh I think people thought I was kidding when I said that. No, you definitely weren't kidding. That came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, wanna hand this in? Yeah, big sale. Don't worry about it, though. I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt, though. Hey, yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald. Can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's? Erin. Yes, Mrs. Guffner? Right. And I'm back. How are you, sir? Erin can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right? No, I'm not getting out there anytime soon. Hey, Kevin. What are you doing? Don't talk to me! Hi, Professor Frank. Andy Bernard, class of '95. Hey, there. Um, I'm a huge fan of your management book, management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here. De-incentivizing? What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale. Uh, why? Well, um, I guess you could say I'm in one of those classic ass-tattoo incentive situations. Yes! Took 'em one day. Are you ready? "I'm not as think as you drunk I am." I like it. I like it. "Do not resuscitate." Okay, let's keep in mind, it's not too late to choose another prize. And there are some great new additions. My car-- For 1,000 points. Or best offer. What else you got? Oh, and then this was Phyllis's idea. - Oh, my God! - So nasty, Phyllis. We were hoping you could do something like this. So coming out of his butt is a-- - Baby. - Baby. Yes. Yeah, no problem. You should think about this. Anyone have any better ideas? I like what we have. - Yeah, nice try. - Yeah. For sure what we have. - It's funny. - It's apropos. Just need a second outside. - You getting psyched up? - Yeah. Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this. Tunes What am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? Confession, I don't know what I'm doing. I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun. And you did that. But my ass is only so big. I mean, I can't do this every day. But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea. Which, by the way, I can't wait for. No one expects me to go through with this, right? Absolutely not. Let's ink my stink! - Andy! - Yeah! My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people. Whoa! Good stuff. Do your worst. Uh, you can keep your pants on, actually. If you just drop 'em down a bit, that'd be great. They're already off, my good sir. I'd really prefer they not be down. Well, I think down's better. Sweating pretty heavily down there. Do you think you could work from this? We made some small adjustments. - Okay, you want me to-- - Just these few adjustments. Yeah. All right, let's begin. This is where I grin and-- Ow! Ow! That was just a cotton swab. Invest in softer cotton, sir. Whew. Oh, boy. Oww! Ohhh! Ho, ho! Ohhh! Whoa! Obviously, you can go the ass tattoo route. And obviously, I'm gonna like it. Draw some blood! Ha! Ahhhhh-haaaaa! Great tattoo. Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him. It's a nard dog. That's my nickety-name. - Yeah! - Woo-hoo! I love it. I love it. Pull up your pants. There's something about an underdog that really inspires the unexceptional. Um, what should we talk about? Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I'm having. Oh, yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help. A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don't know if I should call social services about it. Angela, that's pretty transparently me. Maybe. You know, it's just herbal tea. In mugs with trace amounts of coffee. Yeah, I think you should call social services. I already did. You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancy as in not pretend like we are in this together. - Fine. - Fine.
Back orders and you never call them. - Can you believe this? - There's a dog in the car. You can't leave a dog in a parked car! Snowboarder, it figures. Dude, snowboarders ain't animals? I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. Okay, we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous. Oscar, is not that hard out. A car parked in the sun is like a toast oven. Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sun light. So what, Andy? You wanna just let him die, you scumbag? Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. Come on. Dwight, at least aim it. There you go. Here, doggy. You're not even trying. Come here, doggy, come on. We're losing cloud cover. Oh, don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick. Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time. This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. Get back, buddy. Get back. Oscar, what are you-- What-- No, hey! All right. Yeah! Nice job, Oscar. And one for good measure. Oh! Yeah! So, uh-- Who's gonna take the dog? Why would we take the dog? What if he jumps out the window and runs away? Jim, he's not gonna start-- Shh, stay, stay. Nein. Sit. Good. Oscar, what do you wanna do? This is kinda your deal. You want a dog? There we go. That should do it. - Yeah, it's good. - It'll work. Nice job. - Bye, poochie. - Bye. Woof, woof. What's that come to? Like, what did they each win? Oh man, it's gotta be Over $100,000. Yeah, before taxes. That's still a lot of money. The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. $950,000. And then they quit. And, no one else can focus. This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work. I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things. Hello? Justine. Nice surprise. How you doing, baby? No, no, no. I didn't win. When I got promoted, I stopped-- What? Yeah, yeah. Glen won. Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him. Congratulate him. That would be-- What? Oh, this number is in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right-- Whoops. When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won Playing my birthday. What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well, right? Yeah. We're looking at at least one suicide - and one weird sex thing. - At least. I don't even know what I'd do with all that money. I know what you'd do with all that money. "Hey, Pam. Let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug." No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. And either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop. And then on the weekends, would you hackysack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids? Whoa, saucy. I thought you liked Maine. I think we should get a townhouse in Soho. Soho's mostly lofts, but okay. And then, every morning, I'd walk out onto my terrace, and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know, and just gather ideas for my painting. Oh, God. And then my handsome husband-- Which, ideally, would be me. Would bring me a flavored coffee. Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy? Well, in your fantasy, we're Stephen King characters. I don't know about Stephen King. Get a divorce. Get a divorce. I think I would keep working. And for my salary, I guess I would take, like, a dollar a year. Obviously, I wouldn't come in till noon. And I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean, I'm getting paid a dollar a year, okay? You can chill. Are you kidding me? Guys? If I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. To down here, like Mr. T. And this would get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. Darryl. How we doing on the new warehouse guys? I don't know. What-- Wh-Wh- Do we have new guys? No. Are they on their way over? I haven't hired anyone. What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it. I'm not checking email until lunch. 4-hour work week. - This is kind of time-sensitive. I got it. I'm doing it. Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client. All right, well, until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? As long as you guys don't need me up here. I think we'll be fine. Really? Nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead? Are you volunteering? Of courseI would. But my hip-- I would kill to be at 100%. Jim, how about you? Uh, yeah-- I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should-- Okay, no, no. That-- You are so not-- Oh, God. False. Andy, I will volunteer. Great. And Kevin. Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well, guess what? I will not do a good job. - Oh, thank you. - Sure. Wait, wait. What's this? Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess-your-baby's-birth weight pool. It says "lotto pool." Right on top. Yeah. And I said sorry. Oh, come on. You really think I'm gonna have a 14-pound baby? When did I get so fat? You look awesome. I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here. Where are we in the process? I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys, hire some of them. So I say we're in the early stages of the process. Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night? They guys did invite me out to celebrate, but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement. You do have a fantastic basement. I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement. And taco air is heavy. It settles at the lowest point. Right, um, well, how about we take a look at some applications? This guy wrote his in green ink. That's pretty cool. Check it out. Hey. There you go. There he is. That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect, probably, our Darryl is inside of that Darryl. Okay. 300 boxes of 20 pound white. That's 75 boxes per person. So, that's not so bad. Negative. Deal with it. Nice. Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh! Damn. Ah! Yup. Welcome everybody. My name is Andy, and this is my other brother, Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? Okay. Darryl, how do we usually kick things off? You mean, what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery? Your old crew won the lottery? Does anyone have experience shelving, storing, keeping track-- What do we use? The Dewey decimal system? Wait, wait. So, all the old guys quit? - Oh, yeah. - Well-- One of them, Glen, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple of the guys might start a strip club. But on a boat. And Hide is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. Um, could you guys give us a minute? But stay close. You're all doing great. Maybe grab a coffee, or if there's any donuts out, you can split one. You know, they're for everybody so people get fussy. You know what? Just have a donut. Do you want to talk about this - not-winning-the-lottery thing? - I don't. You sure? 'Cause you keep talking about it, so-- Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers. Good, great. Then, can you say things that aren't like, a huge bummer to everybody? 'Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay. We need you, okay? Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. All right. What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player, or her husband. I didn't feel anything. All right, thank you for coming back in. Again. Now we're going to ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor. Why do you want to work here? I need a job. It's not a good reason. Good. Keeping them honest. Don't just take the first job that comes your way. 'Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later, and you're still there. You could write your obituary tomorrow. It's not gonna change. Are we scaring them straight? I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one. I've never been lucky. And I'm not talking about the lottery. I'm talking about stuff like developing a soy allergy at 35. Who gets a soy allergy at 35? And why is soy in everything? Nice. Right back where I like you. Can you make ten copies of this for me? No. Why not? What are you doing? Uh, buying lottery tickets online. Ah, everyone wants to be rich. But nobody wants to work for it. You came in at 10:30 today, right? Okay, just dismiss it. - Is everyone licensed? - Like a driver's license? No. Warehouse license. Master's in warehouse sciences. I feel that Darryl has talked about a license of some kind. - Is this a joke? - No. Not joking. This is real. Painfully real, what is happening, right now. Okay, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back. There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids. Well, they whipped people, which is helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge and Hide. Yeah. Not that they're not smart people. No, no. Very smart-- Theirs is more of a "physical" intelligence. I'd go with that. Like baboons or elephants. Not that, don't-- Guys, when I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up, and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. It really made them laugh. It's a great idea, Kev. I don't think it applies here, though. So, maybe we just-- Yeah, we move stuff and have fun. Kevin, doesn't apply. Right, my mom-- You need to drop it. Okay? They hate it. I like it a lot, but they hate it, so drop it. Does anybody get distracted easily by bubble wrap? You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap. Obviously. Um-- How much longer is this going to take? Did you hire them? No, because they all left. What do you mean, "they left"? I mean, after you bailed, I got confused, and frankly, a little weird. And the stuff that you said certainly didn't help. Then I think you should fire me. What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you. Yeah, just put me out of my misery. Okay, this is weird. I don't-- I don't get the joke. No? Okay. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me. So Darryl says to me, "fire me", but what he really means is, "I'ma say something really weird. Try and figure out what it means." So I say, "no, you're not fired." But what I really mean is, "I've no idea what you're talking about. "But I'm going to go ahead and hire some people "for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better." I really hope that's what he and I mean. Attention. Does anyone know anyone who could work in a warehouse? We can pay. Come on, Oscar. Who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy? Bulk or definition? Definition. Bruce Kenward. He hangs out at planet fitness. Are those just show muscles, or is he really strong? Oh, he's plenty strong. He used to be Reggie Winters out at gold's gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy, Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves, and, uh, and his triceps went to hell. So, I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings Our fake winnings. And we move to the South of France. See-- No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour De France. It is, yeah. I mean, I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Because in my fantasy, it's Maine, and you love it. Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy. Nope, you-- You're doing a great job at it in my fantasy, right now. Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again? A hot chocolate tea. Gideon, you are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar work force? North America. And diminishing is a little reductive, but, uh, sure. That's the headline version. Great. Well, it will bring a fresh, new perspective to the warehouse. FYI, Wednesday through Friday, I have a pretty full teaching schedule. Oh. Cool. We'll figure that out. Also, FYI, ah, I don't technically have a hearing problem. But sometimes, when there's a lot of noises occurring at the same time, I'll hear them as one big jumble. Uh, again, it's not that I can't hear. Because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing. Got it. Duly noted. You. Coolest tank top I've ever seen. Where did you get that? - Made it. - So cool. What a cross section we have here. It's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet, or know, or even talk to. Message in a bottle, the postman-- Kevin Costner. So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea. You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it. So it's not the dumbest idea. It's not the greatest one-- But the fact remains, we gotta move these boxes. And it's clear we're not gonna carry them. So sadly, it's the best idea on the table. Exactly. Hey, I think we're ready to get this-- - Yup. - Is he okay? He'll be fine. Surprise! Your new crew. Would you just fire me, man? Hey, why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy? You wanna make me happy? Huh? - Yeah. - Give me your job. - Ah, what? - I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why. Reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine, Andy. Everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me. I'm not going to give you my job. It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing. You weren't even next in line. I asked about you. I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people, and you hired Glen, your buddy, to replace you in the warehouse. He was underqualified. They saw that. Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but, uh, you should probably know, I technically don't have a hearing problem. It's just when there's a lot of noises-- Nate. Please. Thank you. You have no business education. You were going to take classes under DeAngelo. What happened with that? He died. He didn't die. His brain died. And my brain is very much alive. And I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it? What was-- What was the last-- I'm having a-- No part of this has anything to do with you. I didn't have time because of my daughter. Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic. And a mediterranean cooking class. Hey, I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you're gonna throw it back in my face! Hey, here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you. She gave you a shot, and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. Okay. Okay, what? Okay, don't fire me. Okay. My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do. I'll put some guys on tonight. The best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now, though. It's gonna be mostly my bunch. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, good. All right. Are they here? What is going on? Oh, hey, guys. Why is the forklift in the wall? Why is the truck empty? Uh, it's not totally empty. Is that grease on my floor? Okay. I can see why you're angry. You're coming into this cold. But believe me, a lot of thought went into this. And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease? Okay, Darryl. Listen, and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing. So now, it's cool. 'Cause we found another use for them. Okay, all right. That's-- Look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things. And? - And we did. - I don't know. Jim, tell them what it's called. That's all right. No, Jim, tell them what the name is. Doesn't matter what the name is. SeÃ±or Loadenstein. That's stupid. SeÃ±or Loadenstein. Tell them why it's called that, Jim. That's okay. We're good. Nope, Jim. Tell us why it's called seÃ±or Loadenstein. Porque es muy rÃ¡pido. Okay. You know what? It's been a really busy day. What do you say we put all this away? Let me see it. It's, uh, in beta testing. Let me see it! Get the thing, go! Lube it up. Kevin, start mopping. Uno, dos, tres. Ah! Yeah. I lost my client. I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup, I have a Swiss passport. I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, the Flenderson Files. Dum-bum-ba. Flenderson Files. We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning, prewar brownstone at the top of a mountain. Right, the city and country combined. Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world. And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. We can chat any time we want. Just like now. Just like now. too bad the schools are terrible, but what are you gonna do about that? What are you gonna do?
Hey. So we saw the new billboard. Yeah? Pretty cool, huh? What better way to announce our new, slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager? How'd it look? You've seen it, right? No. Andy, somebody defaced it. What? How? Morning, Stanley. There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a Phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen. And Andy Gave them that opportunity. Erin, how long did we order those billboards for? - Six months. - Oh, God. I need you to call the billboard company. Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it. Loved it. Which one did you see? Washington street. The one with like 20 dongs on it. Okay, don't be gross. What's going on? Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way. Oh, that's funny. Wait. From the photo shoot with you and me? Yeah, Dwight. No. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Schrute farms is very easy to find. It's right in the middle of the root-vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far. Just give us the address, we'll look it up online. - It's simpler this way. - It's really not. Now, stated arrival time is 3:00 P.M. I don't get the reason for this party. Yeah, what's the reason? What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason? It's just a garden party. Sheesh! You don't need a reason to throw a garden party any more than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason. A few other super simple reminders. No burping, no slurping, when eating, take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl? What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time? I get it. I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be under-bearing for a week if you guys just allStep it up. Andy, we understand basic table manners. We're not children. Yeah, it's just a picnic. This is not a picnic, Phyllis. It's a garden party. There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring. Ugh, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules. How is that better than a barbecue? What is the dress code on this? I'm glad you asked. Connecticut casual. Any chance Connecticut casual is Pennsylvania business? I.E., this is what I'm wearing to your party. Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out. There's a video online. Het-warming impromptu father-son duet.. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Oscar, you've shown me this. I've seen this, that's not you. Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage? It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support any other So, check out, that's my brother's boss look how psyched he is. He's having an awesome time. Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party? Yeah, of course. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I think he did. Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California? I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey, Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch? See you all there at remember your manners, and have a wonderful time. And please refer to the map. Stay off of the web. Thank you. So we've typed in the address. Now let's take a look at the street view. They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by. Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea? There's so much more to it than that. I've been wanting Schrute farms to break into the high-end event-hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. Only one copy in the world And some sucker on the Internet sold it to me for $2. I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. I've only sold one copy. Is there anything you wish you'd done differently to avoid cankles? Nope. I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick? Cece was around 22 weeks, but Philip was much earlier. Philip? Oh, oh, my gosh! Yes, but don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather. Philip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat. Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather. It's after my cat. Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade. Oh, that sounds great. Well that-- that is what you want then, the marmalade? Sure. You don't want to hear the other one? You love marmalade? I'll hear the other one. It's a basil plant! You know, the marmalade sounds great. I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested. Then, the basil will be fine. Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. All right.   Hey, where do I park? I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. You know what, I can probably park it myself. You have to give me your car. It's probably okay that I park it myself. No, I think it's probably better that I-- I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. - It's a finicky car. - Get out of your car. Get out. Have a good time at theThing. It's a little tricky. You might want to be careful--   Mr. Ryan Howard! "Chapter two, announcing guests as they enter "is height of decorum. "The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present." Stanley Hudson, and his mistress Cynthia! James, Pamela, and P.P. Halpert! How's it going over here, guys? Andy, stop hovering. You're being really annoying. Didn't mean to bother you, mabel. Mabel, mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table. Mr. and Mrs. Walter and Ellen Bernard! So you all work with Andy? Well Technically for Andy. Technically for Robert California. He's our CEO. I thought you were the CEO. I don't know how you got there. You said you were running the company. This branch. I'm the regional manager. Oh, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers? Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves. Which, as a matter of fact, they did last week. They threw one for my baby brother. And it was totally amazing, but I couldn't care less. Can I introduce you around now? Uh, yeah, we don't have too long. We have theater tickets. What are you going to see? Moneyball. - Walter Jr.'s choice. - Oh, there he is. - What? - Bronard. I didn't know you were going to be here. I wouldn't have missed it. Okay. Ah! I'm Walter. I'm Andy's younger brother. Oh, hey, how you doing? I'm Jim. Tuna! Right? And this must be your lovely wife, Pam. - No. - Hell no. - She wishes. - No, no, no, no, no. No. Sir, I need to be able to feed all of the guests. I understand. Excuse me. "Chapter four, one of the host's most important duties "is as dance master. "A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon." Ladies and gentlemen, may I present R-r-Robert Califor-r-r-rnia! Hello, Andy. - Welcome. - Thank you. Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, mom and dad. Yes, hello. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Pleasure. Andy, where shall I put your basil plant? Oh, I thought you were going to bring the marmalade. No, I'm certain you said, "basil." This is not funny, man. Let me down. I think this thing is broken. It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works. It's so pretty today. It's getting chilly. We really should be leaving. Um, it'd be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so hang on. Everybody! I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff. Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts. The reciprocity. Let's hear from you guys. Who do you want to toast? Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss because none of us would be here without him. Robert California. To Robert! Yay, Robert! I cannot believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel. Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress? I would like to toast someone who isn't here, but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Philip lipton! I also would like to toast Philip Halpert Who's due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather, who I promised as a child, long before tonight, that I would one day name my son after. To Philip Halpert. To Philip. She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again. I'd like to make a toast to the troops. - Here here. - Yes. All the troops. Both sides. I think we should toast-- Ladies and gentlemen, the last supper. "Chapter nine, the tableau vivant is not only welcome, but expected entertainment at any garden party." Andy, I think that we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California! To Robert. I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California-- You can't triple-toast somebody! I mean, at least not until we've hit everyone once. I'll say a few words, if that's all right with you, Andy. Yeah, yeah. You people say I led you. But it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success. But the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, "I want this and that, right now," like petulant children. You know the difference between a crying baby and a manager? One day, the baby will grow up. But without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. - Cheers. - Cheers. To Robert California. From the moment you entered our building and our hearts-- Some of you know that we have an Internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter banes Bernard sr., please report to the stage. I'm eating, Andy-- Aw, come on! Okay. - Yes! - What do you want to do? - Well, how about one of our classic father-son duets? Oh, whoa, you sure? Really? That's-- - That's a little tricky. - Okay.  Saying I love you, is not the words--  - It's too high. - Yeah? Right? It's high, but it's not that high. Right, it feels strange. Just take it down.  Saying I love--  -  saying I love you--  - You know, just give it-- - Just give it to me. - Yeah. Yeah. Okay! Uh, something like  Saying I love you   is not the words--  You don't come in yet.  I want to hear from you   it's not that I want you   not to say but if you only knew   more than words   is all you have to do to make it real  Is anyone filming this? Seriously? Erin! Yeah, it's either taping or calling.  what would you do   if my heart was torn in two  You know what? Walter Jr. is here. Why don't you come up and join us? Nah, come up and do something with me. I don't know, pops. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here. Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Whoo! Come on! Come on. This old thing. Man, I don't even--  may the good lord be with you   down every road you should roam   and may sunshine and happiness   surround you when you're far from home   and may you grow to be proud   dignified and true   and do unto others   as you'd have done to you  Cheers! All right! What are you doing there, buddy? What's going on? Cheers, cheers, cheers. Get your own guitar. If you'd like to make a call - Sorry. - Please hang up and try aga-- I am so cold. That's because you didn't bring a jacket. My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Whoever heard of an old beet farmer? Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I can spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here. Oh, really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The pewter package has the least amount of goats. It's not no goats. Still 10 to 12 goats depending on the availability of the goats. Now, the goat package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking? Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me? I can get you exotic meats. Hippo steaks, giraffe burgers. We'll talk. It'll all be goat. Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call. Hi. What was that display? I don't know. I just thought If I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am, that you'd be proud of me. - Andrew. - I know. I know that you're proud of me. I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky-dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man. Don't act like a little boy who needs-- I think if I had parents like that, I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was too. Guess we found Andy's rosebud. Rosebud? It's a reference to citizen Kane. It's something that explains why a person became the way they are. I know citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was. It just represented what was important to him as a child that he missed. That school of thought-- Let's just agree to disagree. No. You're wrong. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm too hot anyway. My body has somehow become acclimated to Southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there. - Oh! - Yeah. Ah, wellYes. That's nice. Thank you. It was a nice party. Uh, setting was a little strange. The food-- Sandwiches were dry. Bye, tuna! Bye, Pam! Hey, everybody. I'm going to leave. And I just wanted to say I'm really sorry. Cheeseburger or hamburger? Um, cheeseburger? Nard-dog. Thanks, Oscar.   What are they doing? Closing ceremonies. Nice touch. I think I left my wallet in your house. Who cares? Right here. Mr. James Halpert! - Keys, forgot my keys. - Stop forgetting things. I didn't forget them. They're right here. That was stupid. Mr. James Halpert! So sorry. I forgot that thing. Idiot. Whoo. Mis-- Mi-- what are you doing? Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office? That's a stupid question. Obviously Mr. James Halpert!
Approved!  from South park! It's genius!  I'm  I decided to prescreen all the Halloween costumes this year. I've three simple rules. Don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously. The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The one who sacrifices his life. Oh! Wow. Spoiler alert! It's been out for ages, man. Costume vetoed. Yeahlt's, uh Somebody's already called that. Who? Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow. This is ridiculous. Why can't there just be two Kate Middletons? Guys, I know. I mean, I wish there could be too. It's likeI can't choose. They're both amazing, it's just-- look, I stayed up all night, and I watched that GD wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here. Because I was there. "You're the people's princess! Diana was nothing!" I thought you were at your sister's funeral. What I said was, "my sister's funeral is this weekend." Didn't say I'd be there. Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids Doin' it. Um Can I maybe squeeze through the There you go. There we go. Thank you. When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together every single day. Jim, put it on. Put it on, man. I don't know if I can. Come on. The three amigos. - Three kings. - All right. I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this Jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying, so I am Chris Bosh. If you get into season one, then you'll really-- Oh, my God. What the hell is wrong with you? It's called a costume. What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman? Ryan, will you please tell her who I am? Whoopi Goldberg. Has no one here heard of Kerrigan? From Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault. Every Halloween, I tell him the same thing. You can't bring weapons into the office. And every year, he says the same thing. "Soon as I get my weapons back, I'm gonna kill you." But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know? I'm the lucky turkey. Everybody looking good? This is-- this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I I think you guys look great. I justWanna make sure. This is the best we can do? I just got a text from Broccoli Rob--"boo!" It scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California-- "looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high." Scared the [Bleep] out of me. Good day, pamaroo. Could you shoot this off for me? - Yeah. - Australian accent. What are you doing? Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it. If you're doing something I don't. Oh. - Are you-- - That Andy. So hot and cold. One day, he's like, "fax these documents, please." Then the next, he's like, "Pam, you fax them. Who cares what Erin's feeling?" - Right? - Oh, Erin. Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of one to three? UmTwo? That's, like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear. No, I mean, you're doing great. And Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right? - Yeah. - Yeah! Send completed. You are the best in the biz. I can't deny. Bob and I are doing the Scranton Haunted walking tour. I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing. Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the man in black I say hello. What happened, Pam? Okay, when I was 22, I worked there, and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it, until one day, before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black. But when I turn around, there's no one there. - Oh! - So I tell the cook my story-- Wait, they have food there? And he said, "that's what everyone sees. That's the man in black." No. My wife does not believe in ghosts. Hey. Hey. Oh, this "man in black" thing. What do you think that was about? What do you mean? Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was. I saw a ghost. Mm-hmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, - do you ever wonder what it was? - It was a ghost. I told you this on, like, our first date. Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the blue angels. I figured you had to top it. I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost. Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack. Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, areA laborer. Yes. Everyone, this is Bert, my son. Bert, this is A paper company. Hey, Bert. Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane. Here, use this one. Ah, look. "Pin the wart on the witch." How did you know I was bringing my son? Oh, I didn't. It was for us. But he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game? That stuff's for babies. Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us. Wow, who shot our grownup party with a kiddie ray gun? We're still getting it set up. It's gonna be really cool. Extraordinary. Did you plan this? Well, Toby and I did, yeah. And I overheard, and thought, "hey, that'd be fun. Don't mind if I do." If you turn out the lights, we'll do a little dance. A-one, two, three!  Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry bones  Now we're the skeleton crew Delightful. Thank you. Now, then, how are we today? - Fine. - Great. Just fine, Kelly? Everything all right? - Mm-hmm. You feeling fulfilled in your life? - I guess. - You guess? So there is something you want that you do not have. I try not to think about it. Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cookin'. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours? - Never marrying. - Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby? So great. Oh, I put those up. I know. I'm taking them down. I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall-- This is more halloweeny. I don't know about this, guys. Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it? Oh. So can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings? Because I hate all of this. Very low pressure in the Sargasso sea. Warm air from South America. Cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm. Yeah, perfectly mediocre. What are you anyway? I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul. If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft. I am Kerrigan from Starcraft, I've been censored. If you're gonna be a Zerg, at least be a lurker, not some girl. Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg Swarm! Yeah, she also has boobs. Yeah, but no nipples. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month. Oh, yeah. Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know? UmI just thought you could use some help. You know, 'cause Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed. And maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG. - But that's it? - Hmm? There's nothing about me, orI? Uh, can we talk about it at the end of the day? I got a call. Gotta make a call. Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can. Yes. I don't know. Hmm? - Gabe. - Sweetheart. I'm throwing the Halloween party, and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use someExtra pizzazz. Okay, where does Gabe factor in? Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in, and I didn't stop crying? Yes. Lars and Takako's. Okay, well let's say I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just more adult, more scary and sexy. I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine. No, just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff. Oh, that'd be scary. What are you thinking about? All right, let me go get it. Pam Halpert. Hey, it's Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight, 'cause I've read a lot about this really great documentary. Is it called Ghostbusters? - It's called Ghostbusters. - Yeah. It didn't look like that. He didn't have a Buster sign around him? Why don't you draw him? Why don't we see this old man? Okay. Yeah. Fine. I'll draw him. Okay. I ain't afraid of no ghosts. - Whoa. - Mm-hmm. Dwight, are you eating a stick? - It's a root, idiot. - Okay. Everyone hates you. That's really rude. I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true. What do you like, tornados? - Try influenza. - Oh, yeah? What's the vaccine you could take to avoid a hurricane? Open up a newspaper. Oh, look, a hurricane's coming. Suppose you're gonna tell me the scariest animal is a shark. Try a box jellyfish. What are we talking about? I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate, and then Meredith said that she believes in them too. You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don't scare you? I'm only scared of real things, like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don't exist, like ghosts or mummies. Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums. - Ha. Yeah. You-- - Prank. - It's true. They've been preserved for thousands of years, they're all over. Why on earth would a museum put a mummy in it? I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here, little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room. Grown-ups are gonna use it later. Party looks fun, doesn't it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer-- I'm using it. I'm about to play Starcraft with him. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. It's funny. Okay. - Loser. - Yeah. Pam, do you think anyone's gonna notice I've worn this costume before when I wasn't pregnant? You know, I guess nobody would believe it still fits. Hey, guys, I'm an Oscar Liar Weiner. Oh, my God. Party's tight, E. The fog is cool. Thanks. It's on medium. Perfect. It really looks great. You did a great job. Oh, so we don't have to have that talk. We should still have that talk. Maybe you could come by my office at, like, 4:45? Cool. Okay. Ahem. Okay, everybody. Be prepared To be scared. Okay. Okay. The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea. Is that my grandmother? - What's the story? - There is no story. Yeah, seems like there isn't a narrative. Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting. What the hell is going on here? Okay, I think we've seen enough, you--you can turn it off now. Enough. Yeah, kill it. Go ahead and turn it off. Thank you. How'd you get in my car? Where is this from? That is so upsetting. That was awful. Robert, I apologize. I'm sorry. I got confused. I heard that you wanted to make the party more adult, but I think I know what to do now. This game is called pecker poker. It's the game of cards that gets you har-- What we have here is a classic misunderstanding. Why didn't you simply ask Andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. The two of you are obviously very close. Oh, I see. This no longer seems like my business. UmAll I knew is that you wanted to have a talk with me at the end of the day, and I got nervous, so You were gonna talk at the end of-- I'm not here. Did you think I was gonna fire you? No, I wasn't. I'm sorry, this must be really uncomfortable for you. I'm never uncomfortable. Mm-kay. Erin, I think you know I've been dating someone. Sure. And it's getting a little more serious. She's never come by, so Yeah, she's never called here. Unless it's your mom. No, I didn't want her to call 'cause I thought it would be weird, but Now it's weird that she's not calling. Two dates? Three dates? Wow. I'm so happy for you guys. Um, let me know when you get to 40. I'll see you guys. I should go. I just don't give a , I mean, you're a rational person. Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL Jersey during the playoffs, how is this any less logical? Careful. Whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's gonna help the Eagles win. - Really. - No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the eagles will hear about and wanna play better. It's not-- - Exactly. - Thank you. Go. Get up there right now. - Got it. - Dwight. You wanna attack, or let them come to us. Your call, B. - Unleash the hell storm. - Dwight. - Nice. - Dwight! - Got him. Go! - Yes! Is she Asian? I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. - Maybe from the forest. - Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest? I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city. Looks terribly real, doesn't it, creed? - No. - Are you scared of snakes? You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby. Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive. Honestly? Jim gives me the creeps. What am I up to? Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, "mom, there's a ghost in my closet." Now you say one of two things. One-- You're just having a bad dream, or two-- Let's go see what it wants. I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim. Okay. I'm not gonna lie to her, either. Oh, come on! When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. She walked to the nursery, and there in baby's crib was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter. - Oh, my goodness. - The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby - For they were mummies. - No! Amongst them, was a man. - Tall, slim - Jim. Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. "Oh, wait," she thought. "I don't have a husband." For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Every time she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, and threw open the door. "Baby, are you okay?" Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother, and said "I'm fine, bitch. I'm fine." Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us? How dare we let it into our decision-making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships? It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear? - Toby? - Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? - ? Dem bones, dem bones, dem--? - You're fired. What? You heard me. Pack your things. What? You can't Gabe, are you? I'm the CEO's son. Pack your things. You're done.
Hey, everybody! It's closing time! You all gotta go home but you can stay here.  Closing time  Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something that tells you that the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day, it's weird. -  Closing time  - Tell me that you're okay.  One last call   so finish your whiskey and beer  Oh, my boss is singing closing time. Maybe that's what you're hearing. - Come on, Pam! - Okay.  Closing time   time for you to go home to the places you will be from  Let's see. Andy has been manager for 105 days. Which means I've heard closing time Still don't know the words.  Ah wah dah wah home and home and home   I know who I want to take me home   I know who I want to take home   I know who I want to take home   take me home  You know what? Fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't wanna sing, no traditions!  Closing time   every new beginning  I never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it. But that songs means it's time to go home. Now it's my favorite song.  every new beginning   comes from some other beginning's end  Good night. - Who's your favorite iron chef? - This report is atrocious. You go first. The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error-prone office. Well, the monitoring software is a double-edged sword. - Sometimes the infer-- - Sorry. Go ahead. Mm-hmm. Did you need something from us? Yes. Your attention. Uh, because No. That is all. Last night, I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power, athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "we're number 2!" As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants. Last week, an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free. Oof! That's not good. Chalk that one up to tweedle Dee and tweedle dum out there. Who are they? They're both Kevin. Oscar is the sex and the city gang. And Angela, if you can picture-- Sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all. I would agree with that. Simply end the mistakes. End the mistakes. Easy. When I come back next week and this report show me no mistakes, we can talk about names all day. Our favorite names, silly made-up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice? - I would like that. - End the mistakes. That's all I ask. And you can't have a favorite iron chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all. I'm just saying with the NBA lock-out, I think roller derby's in a really good place right now. So my pitch is me, Pam, you, and someone else-- - Maybe justine. - Bah! Nope. Not justine. Never justine. - Is that off again? - Oh, yeah. - Okay. - Hey. Mandatory warehouse safety meeting today. Uh, we don't really do those. We just sign the thing. Are you really this lazy? I'll be there. - Hey. - Hey. Mondays suck. Yep. I'm just trying to-- Thanks. I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time. And today might be the day to use it. What do you got? Allow me. You're gonna love this. Ah, I should've used a shorter string. Never mind. I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work. Sounds controversial. Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two? Do not go there! You're the deuce I never wanna drop. Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. I just need your go-ahead. Go do the voodoo and you do so well. - I will do my voodoo. - Mm-hmm. - Hey. - Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship. - For you? - Yes, for Gabe. Who are you seeing? That's great. Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse. Oh. I'm not technically seeing her, but I've seen her-- with the eyes-- and there was attraction in at least one direction. So You know, I don't have to do paperwork unless you're actually dating. Okay, well, once this starts, it's gonna be moving fast. It's gonna be hot and heavy, and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock, you know? But I mean, have you talked to her? Yeah, we had a whole conversation about mondays. Do you know her last name yet? Toby, I'm gonna tell you her last name tomorrow because she's gonna be screaming it tonight. She's gonna be screaming her own last name? Hey. Watch it. Good luck, Gabe. - Hi, guys. - Hi. I just wanna say that you all - have been doing amazing work, really. - Thank you. And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call-- Dwight? The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office, from a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a homerun. One home run and you're out. If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens, like we block mindsweeper. Or in this case, an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultant's report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shut down? And as a failsafe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him. What emails are you talking about? "Robert's favorite songs, Creep by TLC, Creep by Radiohead." Remember that one, Jim? Uh, "there's no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper." Oscar. "He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappoint him." Kelly. That's not that bad actually. "P.S. We should kill him." Wait, so you installed a doomsday device? No, it's an accountability booster. Which when it goes off, it destroys everything very similar to a doomsday device. Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. The point is is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task. - Um, no, we're not. - No. And you are a psycho who is ruining our lives. We can't do this, Dwight. Look around. Smile. Nod. Smile and nod. They're making me out to be a Bond villain. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop nothing to remake the world Like Not Dr. Moreau. Someone good. Dr. Frankenstein. Dr. Jekyll. Not them. Doctor Are you sure that this is a good idea? I mean, that thing about this office is we make a lot of mistakes. But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve. All right, everybody. Looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful, double check everything. Or the accountability booster will getcha. This doomsday device sounds like a scare tactic to me. There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment. Oh! There's one mistake. Now we only have four strikes left until a homerun. Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device. It's not a doomsday device. Gosh! We can do this, you guys. - First! - Second. It's not a race. Thirrr-- Third. Who knows what the belt is for? It's for protecting my ass when you suckers lift more than you can handle. 'Sup. I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous. Apparently, we have a visitor. - Gabe, everyone. - Hi, Gabe! All right, so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays. Look at this. This is enormous. Oh. I got the sense that Val enjoys a good put-down. Considering that's the only thing I know about her, I will be milking that hard. It's like a hula hoop. Right?  Mele kalikimaka is Hawaii's way  You done? The Michelin man called. He wants his cummerbund back. Remember we have to give Regal Escrow their refund by five. I'm on it. Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project. Good thinking. Apparently a big client for this company needs to know the story of how paper gets made. Oscar, use a calculator. When the stake are this high, there's only one computer that I trust, and it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. All right, everybody, you're doing great! Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible. But I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for 30 minutes, and now look-- She's hard at work. - Dwight, question. - No questions. If this doomsday device goes off-- Accountability booster. If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs, are you gonna feel good about that? I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is gonna work. Try mose 1234. Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like, um, z64$8. Not that exactly, Jim. Something like that. Okay. How about "Scranton strangler 666"? - Nope. - No? Oh. Shoot. You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, okay? But I appreciate your energy and your teamwork. You apply this to your regular work, you won't even notice that the device is there, watching you, ready to strike. What's Dwight's mother's name? Um, Hedda. No. Once you've ready the packet, sign the back. Hey, Darryl, I was thinking, um, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. A $100 bill. Should cover it, I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, okay? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val? Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back. - Yeah. Sure. - Uh Mm-hmm. Caramel soy latte. - No, a decaf frap. - Got it. You sent the late notice to Rinehart and Wolfe, right? Mm-hmm. 670, 620. - Uh-uh. - Yes. Oh, no. What does this mean? What does it mean? Guh. That's five strikes. Well, I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today. Dwight, we got five strikes. Really? Did the email go out, or--? It goes out automatically at 5:00 P.M. There's got to be a way to stop it. Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it. Okay. Dwight, you may now enter your password. - No. - What? You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day? We did our best. No, you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me, you tried to break into the machine. What? You're a real crumb bum, you know that? Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from? UhThe man tree puts his penis-- Okay, all right. Andy, back me up here please. - No. - What? No! Dwight, be human for once. Shut down the machine. Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine! Shut it down! Good luck finding a new job, idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative. Dwight's car is gone. I bet he went home. Some of us should go there and try to talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email. Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you andYour breasts are enormous. That can help us. - Kevin has that lovability. - Guys, come on. I'm right here. Jim, I want you to go find Robert. Just be where he is in case that email goes out at 5:00. You can try to delete it or something. Okay, where is he? He's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash. I'll try both. Oh. Did you come to reason with me? Got you something. And, uh, I just really wanna talk to you. Get lost. Well, now hold on. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse. Um Do you need a hand? Yeah, you need a hand? If you hit another horse, you dug too far. I'll see you next week, Will. Robert? Jim, what are you-- What a surprise! Yeah, well, you know, just had a meeting-- Squash meeting. Yeah? You up for a game? A game or a match? Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it. Are you okay, Kevin? Where you going? In. I'm hungry. Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water? Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you, Kevin. They stay on. Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is. This is the newest addition built by Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009. That's too much doodle and not enough lab. Yeah, when are they gonna do a labradoodle that's just lab? That's what I'm saying. Hey. - You're welcome. - Thanks for the coffee. So tonight I was thinking I'm gonna go to the cemetery, I'm gonna drink a little wine, and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me. Are you asking me on a date? Yes, I am. Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal. It's a matter of policy. I could quit. Problem solved. Don't quit. Good policy. It's sensible, smart. All right, serving. Serving, serving, serving. - In the box. - In the box. Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left. Oh, now you can do math? Where were you two hours ago, beautiful mind? I made a mistake. I'm sorry! I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition. Get everyone's signature, including our clients. March down to Florida And shove it up your butt. It's not that funny. Oh, Pam, you got something on your shirt. Oh! Oh, well. Pobody's nerfect, right? Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's nobody's perfect. Nice stroke, Pam. No, it's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect? Like, I can't even say those words right. I haven't heard that before. That's-- that's funny. Dwight, there's just the small matter of-- You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk. Any specific animal? - I'm thinking cow. - Don't say cow. Ugh. What are you doing? It's five to five. Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own. - I really think he will. - That's insane. Just trust me. Trust you like I trusted Dwight this morning? I got this. Thanks for everything. Sive drafely. Isn't it supposed to be drive safely? Is that my phone? Sounded like mine. No, I think it's mine. Let me just check real quick. All right. Oh, it's mine. You took it out of my bag. Oh. Woop. Yeah. - Can I have it? - Yes. - Right now? - Yes. - Here you go. - Whoa, no, wait, wait, whoa! - Oh, man, I'm sorry. - What the [Bleep]? - Sorry. - Jesus. Did it break? - No, it's good. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - What kinda iPhone is that? It's the standard one. The one everyone has. Oh, yeah, I have the one that nobody has. Anything interesting? It depends, Jim. Do you find one-day only Jetblue sales to Buffalo interesting? No, I don't. NoIDon't. All right. WellI am sore, and obviously horrible at this. My serve! Dwight stopped the device. He stopped it! Oh, we still have our jobs. They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I? Just take it easy. Nice and easy. Ah! Classic, right? - Ooh. - I'm all right. - You all right? - Yep. - Skinned knee. - Yep. Agh. Oh. Put a little ice on that maybe. Yeah. - That does not feel good. - Okay, my serve.
- Erin, hey. - Yeah. In two minutes, I want you to come in to this meeting and tell me that I have a really important phone call. I'm not gonna take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me. Who's calling? Nobody. Just say that Just make it up that I have a phone call and I'm gonna refuse to take it. - You're not gonna take it? - Just make up a phone call. - It's not real. - Oh. - Make it up. - Okay. And you come it and tell me. It doesn't matter what it is. You're not gonna get it though? I'm not gonna take it. And then he's gonna be like, "wow, this is a really important meeting." Copy that. Okay. Okay, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting right now, and I'll tell you how we can beat it. Uh, well, we've been going with a-- Andy, you have a very important call. I'm sorry, I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait. Are you sure? It's really, really important. There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting. Really? Because your mother is dead. Oh, my God. I don't think she's dead. She's dead. She was hit by a bus. She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls. This isn't one of those times. It's the police. They said it's the worst they've ever seen. Andy, I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences. Oh, you must take this call. It's Yeah, um, line one? Line two. - Hi. - It's Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died. Oh GoshThank you, officer. Look, man, this is a bad idea. Did she have any last words or-- Really? That is messed up, man. Oh, make sure that your client gets the best deal possible. You're a bad man, Andrew Bernard. That is so mom. You know, this stuff can come back to get you. It's called karma. Let me tell you something. - You do not wanna-- - All right, well, thank you, officer. Erin, please hold all my other calls. Where were we? - Hey, Cathy. - Hi. How's it going? Everything make sense? I think everything is under control. - Great. - You should sit down. Oh, no, I'm fine. No, I should go fill out my paperwork. Okay. Oh, that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this. Oh, we know. I'm training a temp to be my replacement while I'm on maternity leave. Oh, I should have mentioned I'm pregnant. You probably didn't notice, because it's impossible to tell because I'm so small. But, yeah, I'm pregnant. Oh, come on. Hey, asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single? Hmm, doubt it. Yeah, me too. - You doubt it? - What's that? Why do you doubt that she's single? Honestly, I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan. Right? What are you doing with my lunch? I'm delivering it from the fridge. It's like a porno-- Hey, did anybody order a pizza? It's not pizza. Yeah, and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd wanna eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes. I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in? Uh, you tell me. So word on the street is she has a boyfriend. Well, he's probably a drug dealer. That's the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just, uh, you get her hooked on blow. It's gonna be nice to have just like a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office. Yeah, aesthetically speaking, strictly. - She adds a nice presence. - Good energy. Yeah, it's gonna be nice to have someone hot at Pam's desk, huh? Oh, no, no, no, no, not even. I'm kidding! Oh, my gosh. You guys, she's obviously super cute, I get it. But I'd like to point out that there's 50 pounds more of me to love If that's your thing. Pam, you look more beautiful - now than ever. - Radiant. Thank you guys, really. Thank you, very sweet. Yeah, you have this sexy glow. You know, it's one of the most common fetishes. Really, well, thank you all. You know, it's not just pregnant women who don't get their due. You know who's gorgeous? Helen Mirren. Yes. Yes, have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing. You know what would be the hottest thing ever - Is a pregnant Helen Mirren. - Oh! Now we're talking! Okay, okay. No, no, no. This is disgusting. Do you realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66-year-old pregnant woman. In this case, yes. No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman. - No, we're not. - No Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironoff. That's right, you're fake salivating over a Soviet-era Russian. - Nice scatting, man. - Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point. Not bad, fellas. You're better than you look. Hey, screw you! Hey, Robert. Are we meeting early? Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here? Well, we're all musicians, and we play together sometimes. You're a band. Thank you. We're called Kevin And The Zits. That was never agreed upon. I miss being in a band. Miss no more! What do you play? Join us. I have a tambourine. Tambourine? You know I'm the CEO, right? CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends. I play a harmonica. I think I have one in the car. - Great! - Nice. Guys, Robert is gonna be a Zit. Again, never agreed upon. I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California, and now he wants to be in our band. And when you're in a rock n' roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life. Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right? Yeah, even cooler. We all got to go sometime. Hey. Hey. Helen Mirren. Hot? Yeah. Super pretty. Huh. What about Cathy? The temp? - Yeah, do you think she's hot? - Nope. I'm not asking if you're into her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive? And I'm telling you I don't. You don't find Cathy attractive? No, I don't. No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody. Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake. Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? That's just absurd. Yes, because she's hot, right? Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry-- Come on. The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth. Dwight, am I hot right now? Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction. What about before? Was I attractive before? MehYou were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drodrop-offoff when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well, now, obviously, you're at an all-time low. Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy. You think Jim's lying? That's so cute. I know he's lying. get him to admit it. Done. I never touch a pregnant woman. Yep, that's the Dwight I need. If we're gonna work together - we need some ground rules. - Okay. Rule one, our only loyalty is to the truth. I think so. Okay. Rule two, we stop at nothing. Well, what does that-- Is that Okay. Rule three, don't fall in love. Yep, good. We're gonna bust this guy. Honesty is very important to me. So important. And then we will destroy the man himself. Let's just see how we feel when we get there. Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life-- No offense, Pam. None taken. What have you got? It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot. Hmm.   Hey, you found us! You guys sound great, man. Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding. Local musician? Local legend. I used to come hear you play every week at The Deerhead. Dude, you're on tv. You're the sportscaster on channel seven. Go eagles! You do that on tv. You guys mind if they join us? - Yeah! - Absolutely! Guys, I've got some instruments right here. Hey, why don't you and me play those? - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, this is awesome. What should we play? Maybe we should warm up with some scales? - Midnight Rambler? - Yeah. Midnigwhat?    have you heard about the midnight rambler?   everybody got to go  Hey, come on in, baby, come on in.   Yeah.   Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single. Oh, I stand corrected. I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas? Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets. - Mike Tibbets, really? - Mm-hmm. Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? - What kind of car does he drive? - Not his mom's car. Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan z. Touche? - Eww! - Kelly, calm down. I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay you should see if he'll get hair plugs. I don't think Jim cares about his hair. Yeah, but I do Pam, okay. It's called being a nice person. I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer. - Jim's on to me. - Hmm? Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it. Just ugly enough to have deniability. Yep. Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then Cathy, he's a really nice guy. Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body. I'm gonna write something mean on his wall. No, Kelly, don't. The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there. With the crotch? With the crotch.   Whoo! Psst, we're not here. - Who said that? - Exactly. How'd I this long triangle? Okay, just shut it. Is he puffing out his chest? I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that? No. Maybe he just said something funny. Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that. I think he's just making her laugh. Time for me to find out. Why's he making her laugh so much? Just gonna walk over here-- Whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! - Dwight! - Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm totally fine. - Dwight! - Yes? - Wha-- Jim. - Sorry about that. Aw, cramp, I'm just-- Dwight! Why? I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. balance. Leave. Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing. Why was he making her laugh so much? Oh, hey. I'll just be a second. - Yeah, take your time. - Okay. Oh, that line from Zoolander? - Mm-hmm? - It was from a deleted scene. So we were both right. Told you. Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-- Oscar, Cathy has a question. Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar. - Yeah? - You okay? Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it. Okay, what can I do to make you believe me? Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now. She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate. Yeah, it's nuts. But I don't know what else to do. And she called it nuts? Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman - had a groove going. - Mm-hmm. Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan? Are you serious? From Star Trek? - Hey, you caught some of that? - I caught it. What, you don't like the blues? I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues. Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. I think the music left without you. - Come on. - Stop shoving me. Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs. Really? This could all go away if you just tell me the truth. Uh, are you all in line? Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? Now I'm gonna ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert? Si. Wait, that's it? That's the question you're gonna ask him? We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is. You have to share the machine with others. Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten. Okay, Dwight, come on. - You can go first. - Thank you. Jim, are you serious? Oh, you know what? This reminds me. Cece needs a new toothbrush. Oh.   Maybe we could switch instruments. Yeah. 'Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised. Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right. We had to leave because of creative differences. Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing. Guys, this mean's they're Kevin And The Zits now. No, man We are. - Well-- - No, no, no. Okay, you're done. I have a new heart, you know. Do you really, tin man? Okay, where were we? No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back Yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. In my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time. Do you find Cathy Simms attractive? No. Yep, he's lying. Ah, see, was that so hard? I am not lying. - Really? - Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test? I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really? - Wait, what? - Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar. Jim, you have high blood pressure. Oh, he is definitely attracted to her. Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure? Yeah, but I don't smoke. When was the last time you went to the doctor? I don't know. It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-- - Okay. - Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you? Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul. It's not really your choice though, is it? Death waits for no man. - Okay. - Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor. Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name? Just go home. It doesn't matter. But-- Hey, Cece's toothbrush. Thank you.  Oh, baby, I love your way   every day   wanna be with you night and day   day   oh, baby, I love your way
The Sabre code of conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with - our employees, clients - Oh, my God. Kill me! Hey! All right, obviously we're all gonna die. But we gotta get through this, so, Gabe Go ahead. It's okay. Is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so "Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, "policies, and contracts governing our business. - "Be honest, fair - I'm gonna do it. "And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships" Oh! I'm going into labor! Okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody! I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary. I'm going into labor. Or should I have corndogs. I mean-- - I'm going into labor! Okay, three reasons you are wrong about true blood. - Number one-- - I'm going into labor. Here we go! Hey, guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it. - Yeah. - It's not fair, you guys. - Pitiful. - It's stupid. Never cry wolf. - Okay. - Okay. Oh. [Liquid splatters] Oh! Oh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God! Okay. I'm really in labor! This is happening. - Okay, guys. - Okay. Here we go. See you. - Oh! - How do you feel? - Drive carefully! - Good luck! - Bye! - Good-bye! Good luck! [Silence] What? They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients-- It's like a war out there. I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten, with a little help from my friend-- America's bloodiest battle. Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that? It's right here in PA. [Gags, coughs] Well, we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-- Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg. That sounds super inspiring. I'm in! Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War. Actually it is the northernmost. Ha! The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [Scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible. Charge! Well, this could be fun. I-- Yeah, well, the bus has free wi-fi, and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone Kosher or Halal? What's the halal option? Dates, tabbouleh, - and a bagel with cream cheese. - Out. You know, it's the same as the Kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But Who's coming with me? - I'm in. - I'm in too. Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction. Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge. Yes. - One for you. - Cool. Thanks. - And one for you. - Cool. Thanks. And-- Oh. You missed your head. [Laughs] There you go. Phyllis, think fast. All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burnjazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War. You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the tv. Ooh. Isn't the the one where the guy becomes Limitless? It's just not appropri-- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it. All: Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! All right, all right, all right. - [Indistinct] - Not food and stuff. Here. Like it? Oh, if you buy the picnic table, then you've got to get the fire pit. I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies. The fire pit is a no-brainer. - Oh, hi there. - Plants and-- Hi, Robert. Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again. Where is everyone? Where is Andy? Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg. Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here Is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office. Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon. So, here's what we can do. Game changers-- Changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! Excited. Okay. [Stapler clicks] You guys. - J-j-j-ju - Get excited. Shh! Movie's almost over. All right! We're here. Limitless can wait. Fun fact-- In France, they call Limitless "The Man With Many Capabilities." Whoo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen, the 1800s await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back. I got us Source Code on the way back. - Ooh. - All right. Whoo! Wait, where are you going? Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right? Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists. No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour. Yeah, sign says "begin tour here." Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard Tour. After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch. Yeah, but I'm confused. Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg, but when you're talking about DPA, - that's deaths per acre - Mm-hmm. Nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms. Oh. DPA sounds way more important than total deaths. Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written. Dwight, what are you telling this girl? The truth. Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better. Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said. No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth. - Interesting. - Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed. Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal. Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna to tell you this-- - He's a historian. - Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the Civil War? - Not by a long shot! - Yes, yes, yes! - No! - No! - No, it was not! - Oh! No, it was not! Was it the second-most northern? - What? - Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle! Was it the northernmost? No. - Get out of here, Oscar. - Get out of here! I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we? - May I go first? - Absolutely. Raw fish-- The disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, Sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first Sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With Origami. It's the Sushi of paper. This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with? Well, I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-- That was bad. If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. "This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me?" Well, now there is. "Papyr." Paper for women. It's pink, scented, and silky soft. Now you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister. The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with. In the African-American community-- No. [Murmurs] Thought it was worth a try. That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the Peach Orchard, though? Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually, some of the most Excuse me, I had a question for you. - Sure. - Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms? Uh, I haven't heard of that one. Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut? I apologize for my friend, and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding. We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddyap! Tallyho! Are you Lincoln? No, no, I'm-- Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools. I don't see it. Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat - so I can take a picture. - Okay. Quick. Hey! Lincoln's starting. [Light applause] Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm actually with a tour group myself, so-- [Laughter] [Laughs] [Raspy voice] Hello, I'm Abraham Lincoln. Some people call me the Great Emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [Laughter] Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us, and as-- You know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it. - I am not. - Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet. Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is. Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A1 spot? They do that 'cause they think a-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So Cookies. Cookie placement. Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a "for instance." Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products, when we should be pushing our top-performers? [Laughs] [Laughs] There you go. Consensus. Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy. I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet Happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits. All: No! 'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies-- Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that [Scoffs] Like, forget it. Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants? How about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top, and they use legal. That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. - Thank you. - [Laughs] By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus? Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought. Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast, and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry. Hunger! Hunger for victory. Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride. Hunger for hamburger. Hunger for chicken chimichangas. - Right, Darryl? - That's good. Exactly. Now do you know what the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now each battalion had it's own flag, and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away. Chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. - Cost me $200. - Only $200? We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. [Southern accent] What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha-- What's going on here? Whoo-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? [Normal voice] Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left. Andy, this in inappropriate. People died here, man. Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, big tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Whoo-hoo! Spangler's Spring is a mile this way. Oh, wow. So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back. [Grunts] It's-- I mean, come on. Ooh, I don't think I should walk anymore. You know, all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yoghurt, um, coffee, orange juice, and toast. Two poached eggs, and then that half a sandwich on the bus. I-- All right, fine. You know what? I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way that I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even gonna look back. I'm just gonna assume that you're with me. Said you weren't gonna look back. And why is Blackrock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared? I don't know. Right? I mean, you're an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane. Yes. I am an accountant. Dwight, this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we can consult him. - Really? - Yeah. Well, anyone employed by the Gettysburg industrial complex is certainly gonna want to keep quiet about the battle of Schrute Farms. Schrute Farms, did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War. You've heard about it? Yes! Ha! Prepare to be refuted. Go on. Come on. There you go. [Violin plays] Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front. "Dearest mother, "I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. "It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms, and I fear I may never leave this place alive." Melvyn Fifer Garris. Hallowed ground. But the battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all. It was a code used by pacifists from both north and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war. You have to understand, poets, artists, dancers, these kinds of men preferred peace to war. These delicate, lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farm. Amidst the macho brutality of war, this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays, sing tender ballads, and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farm as, uh, the underground railroad for the sensitive and, well, fabulous. Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up. - I've seen enough. - You're right. There should be a monument to this. Never trust a cookie with a woman's name. Pecan Sandie. Lorna Doone. Madeleine. Oh, they'll just break your heart. Kevin, you are-- Robert, I hate to interrupt, but I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac Idea. What? No. Big Mac Idea. It sounds encouraging. It's really, really good, Robert. Let me explain it. No, this is not fair. This is my idea. He's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me. Well, what is the idea? Every time you buy a Big Mac, yet set one ingredient aside. Then, at the end of the week, you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more, because you made it with your own hands. You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. That is 100% your idea. [Door closes] Oh-ho, my. It was just actually cookies the whole time. [Scraping] Damn it. Hey. You guys came. Where's everyone else? Back at the bus. We were locked out. Phyllis is sitting on the ground, eating a dirty sandwich. Yeah, I asked the bus driver to lock it, 'cause our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders. Yeah, sorry everybody else didn't come. I think they're just tired. With holes in their shoes, and they have dysentery. Even without an audience you're still at it. What are you talking about? Our office has a disease, and it goes by many names-- Sarcasm, snark, wisecracks. You take things that people care about, and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That's what you did with this trip. Andy, this whole idea of our situation being just like war, it's just not true. We just work at a paper company, and you're our regional manager. And guess what, man? You don't have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy, if you don't believe me, take a look at what's on my head. I'm wearing a very pink hat. I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure "DM does GB" means something kind of sexual. But guess who's wearing them? All of us. Just for you, man. That's huge. You don't like the hats? - They're terrible. - I hate myself. They just didn't turn out how I wanted. In my head, they were cooler, but they do look weird. The world will little note nor long remember the fight that Jim and I had here at Gettysburg. And that's good, because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army, and I was their general, but I guess it's really just more like they're people who work in an office, and I'm their manager. Yeah, that's really probably a better analogy, now that I think about it. Abe and Mary are seated, watching the show. [Raspy voice] Oh, Mary, this is wonderful! Okay, Mary. Stop your scolding. I'll be quiet. I need her like I need a hole in the head. [Laughter] [Laughs] Mm. Oh Bang!
Oh, a little help. Wow, your hair is really thinning. Standing as proven to be healthier increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now, was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR. Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in suicide cult. No, no, no. You're way off on that one. Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those, and I just couldn't find the sweet spot. Hey, guys, let's just all admit it, okay? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting, and he's never, ever gonna go back on it, right? That's right, Jim. - Hey, man. - Hey. Taking a load off, huh? No. Putting a load on, more like. Good luck with that. Last thing I need is luck. Thank you so much. What are you up to? Oh, look out. - Just-- What are you doing? - Too fast. Ha ha! - Give that back. Come on. - Prank! Oh, that's real creative. You know what, you're right. It's not my best. 'Cause you could easily just bend over and pick that up, right? I could, I just don't feel like a loser. - Because you're sitting? - Standing. - Okay. - Don't! - Because you're sitting? - Standing. You know I have to do this. I know. Whoaaa! AndrewBainesBernard. I think you can just do it with "Andy Bernard." Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out 'cause it's like, oh, I'm taking a test, but I know the answers. In four seconds, my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. There you are. Honey How on earth did you miss the elevator? What was that? I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you, I wouldn't hire his wife. That's why my foundation, the Dream For A Wish Foundation, is gonna put them out of business. They're not gonna know what hit 'em. Everyone I'd like to introduce my wife, Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California, this is everyone. - Hello. - Hi. - Welcome. - Call me Susan, please. Last night at dinner, Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she's here today to see if there's a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard, the regional manager. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hey there. It's a pleasure. Welcome. Thank you. Andy, would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office, introduce her to various departments, find a place where she'll shine? I would love to, but I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100% staffed up. Andy, let's see if there's a good fit first, then we'll talk. All right.  Knock knock knock knock knock knock  You don't have to say it if you're doing it. Remember how you said that you were looking for a place in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics? Uh, weight lifting, yeah. Well, today's your lucky day. I have opened, in this very office building, Dwight Schrute's gym for muscles. - Wanna take a look? - I'll take a look. Your path from obesity begins right here. I've been meaning to join a gymFor my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black president. I never realized how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay president or a supermodel president. I want to see all the different kinds of presidents. Obese people in my office building are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster. It takes more freon to keep them cool. They flush the toilets more often. Plus, their massive BMS bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash. All right, the DM express is pulling out. All right, well, it's really nice to meet you, Brian. Uh, it's actually Ryan. - Oh, Ryan. - Yeah. Bitch. We will start here at Erinville. - Hi. - Reception. You're classic one-man operation. Although, I was watching a movie, and Meryl Streep had two secretaries. I was watching a movie, and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just sayin'. Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring. Wouldn't you agree, Andy? - I'll explore exploring it. - Good. Seems like you have this under control, so I'll just duck out and run the company for a while. Okay, next stop on the tour, sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh, boy, our resident truth teller. All right, have at it. Let her rip. What do you hate about this place? Well, it's sales, so you have to be able to live in the world of rejection. Maybe you do. Hi, I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard, okay-- It's paper. We have it, and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it. Jim? Well, it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult. It's the second-easiest job in the world. - Being a mom. - I love shopping. And sales is just the other side of that. That's true. You know, if you joined our sales department, you would be working very closely with our department head, Mr. Dwight Schrute. That's me. Dwight, why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. - Oh. - Survival skills. - Mm-hmm. - Ranking of animals. Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale. Well, make that a red wine and I'll tell you my animal rankings. How am I supposed to pull this off? The entire office is being nicer to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room-clearing farts right now. Ready? What do you think? Huh? Um, no, no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw V. You haven't even looked around yet. Look.. Gravel bucket squat yoke. Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station. - You ever cut tin before? - No. Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus, I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now, let's go over membership. I'm gonna need the first month's and the last month's up front for $49 a month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month. Obviously, you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not gonna pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym. Darryl Make a real gym. I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar, and I do have some experience with bookkeeping. But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is. I would work in customer service, and, um, HR, even. Those are fully staffed as well. Are you telling me that there's no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands? Yes. I am the CEO, and I am telling an employee of mine what to do. Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings-- - Robert, it's all right. This is very uncomfortable. Obviously, there's no place for me here, so thank you for trying. - Why don't we just let it go? - No. Absolutely not. Andrew, there must be something you can do. There must be. Think. Well, there are a lot of considerations. I would be eternally grateful. It's not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one. All right! Well, then, welcome aboard. So what happens next? We get you over to HR and then get you set up with accounting. Hang on. - Hello? - Say "hello, grandma." Hi, gam gam. Hold one finger up to Susan. You'll just be a second. You numbskull! You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, "are you taking your medicine?" Are you taking your med-meds? Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. You didn't say good-bye to your grandmother. We promised we'd never say good-bye. Attention! I am now accepting memberships for the Dwight Schrute gym for muscles. First 20 members can take advantage of our "pay what you weigh" promotion. All I need is another gym. As if I don't have enough drama. We have a gym at home. It's called the bedroom. Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner, that's Bruce's. Jeremy says-- Enough. Oscar, enough. - Kelly? - I have these sneakers, which are basically just like a gym for your feet, so That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta bet the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time. Did you bring your passport with you? Who walks around with their passport? Well, I do. Always ready for adventure. - Have you had any? - No. Hey, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away. Andy, if he didn't want her working here, then why did you hire her? Oscar, it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her. How can we do that? She's simply wonderful. This is all pathetic. I am not asking, I am ordering. How mean are we talking about? It would he great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable. Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her. Here you go. Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped, and I don't have a computer. Well, that's a sales desk. Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. IDon'tKnow. No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing. That's Gerald. Oh, wow. So cute. Oh, that is so cute. Aw He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle? Yeah, he's in a ladle. That's adorable. How on earth - did you get him in a ladle? - He did it himself. Is that ladle stainless or Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma. Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. It's not that kind of ladle. - Very cute. - Aw, let me see. Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've gotta recharge this. I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert. Your employees don't seem to be taking to me. Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this. What is going on? Please. Andrew, my wife Has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night. Okey-dokey, artichokey. - You hate it, don't you? - Do you not want me here? - Why would you say that? - It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either. - It's not thatExactly. - But it is something. Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that. Why would you not want me working here? I don't know. I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he? Yes! - The dude is an enigma. - Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he? Got it. What do you think you're doing? Getting my sweat on. I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds? I just did, like, I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was? - No. - Eight minutes! Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week. I figure I'll start slow. Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James! It's Lejon Brames. That's what I said. You know, get it right. I know. - Cameras - Ooh, still here. Terrific. Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here. - Well, that's a shame. - It just was one of those thi-- Is it? Because we talked about it, and it seems like that might be what you want. - Which is fine. - Where did this come from? Did Andy say that? No, he did not. But I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him. What's the struggle. He made a great call, hired a great person. You sure about that? - Absolutely. - No games? No games. Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me. Enough of this. I mean, real-- Enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest. - Andy - Yes. Why do you keep looking at my husband? Andy, just answer the question. - No games? - No games. Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in, and he says, "in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. "I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen." You lying son of a bitch! Tell my wife you're lying. I am lying. I am a compulsive liar. - That's not true, is it? - No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time, and I was just telling the truth about your husband. - Jim knows. He was there. - This is preposterous. - Robert - Let's get Jim in here. Where's Jim? He just rolled out and crawled out. Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open-- Okay. That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere. Oh-- OwOwOw Creed, I was never here, all right? Okay. What about your friend? Oh, boy. This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked. Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions, and I might not do what you say. First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor. Okay, I'm not doing that. Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well, how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl. I didn't know Darryl joined. Looks that way. Nice pelvic bowl. Deep. - Hello, Jim. - No, no. No, no, no! Don't. Damn it, tuna! So I think you know what we want to know. - Do I? - Yes. I know. I do. Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness. I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can. For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here? That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something. I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse. I think we've got ourselves an answer. - No - That makes complete sense, right? Thank you all for a wonderful day. - Perfect! - Jim - Yes? - Answer the question, please. I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking. All right. Thanks. Yes. All right. - Uh - Yeah. Yep. Thank you. Andy. Hey, Mrs. California. Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today. You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me. Yes, I thought we really hit it off. Yeah. Well, different circumstances. Yeah. - Who knows? - Who knows? Maybe after all this settles down Totally. It's a date. Hmm? You're nothing! You're so weak! You call yourself a man? Huh? This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy. Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own, and never come back to my gym again! Dwight, come back and spot me. All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. - What do you want? - To push this bar up. No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. - What is your goal? - Help me! - What do you want?!?!?!?! - To look good for Val! Val Kilmer? I don't buy it, it doesn't make any sense. Wow. I figured out your goal. I'm gonna make you the buffest guy Val Kilmer has ever seen.
Christmas time is here! Wow! Thanks, guys. That sounded amazing. Hi, I'm  Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true. Who's excited to get their holiday wishes? Holiday wishes What's that, Stanley? We know exactly what holiday you're referring to. It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party. I've been here 18 years and I've suffered through some weird, thematic christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, a Pulp Fiction Christmas, a Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas, Mo Rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas. I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. Might not have been the best idea. I don't want no kwanzaa wreath. I don't need a dreidel in my face-- That's its own thing. And who's that black Santa for? I don't care. I know Santa ain't black. I could care less. I want Christmas. Just give me plain baby Jesus lying in a manger Christmas. What is the status on my wish? Fulfilled. Brought my bicycle so I can be your designated driver later in the event that you drink too much, which is by no means required. What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood? That, I cannot do. But I did get you an acre of property on the moon. Where, dark side or light side? Light side. Is it by the sea of tranquility? As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent. - Beachfront. - Thank you, Andy. So whose wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica. Come on, guys, Jessica. Jim, tell them who Jessica is. She's not your grandmother, is she? Ugh, gam gam's name is Ruth, Jim. You should know. I introduced you on speaker phone that time. Jessica is my super serious girlfriend who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way, our repartee. That's great. When you know, you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man? Totally out of your league. So, in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica, and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault. And don't go near gam gam. I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like, we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home. I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica, if you want me to be. Oh, no, no, it's fine, Kelly. It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her. That's okay, I don't want you to do that. Hello. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, happy Pancha Ganapati. Ew, what is that? The five day hindu celebration in December, honoring the God Ganesh, patron of the arts. Cool. - Hey, man. - Hey, oh! How you holding up? Because of your wife leaving you. Kevin. I actually appreciate the human intimacy. I feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla. Yeah. It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse. Well, you came to the right place. Ah. It-- This party will cheer you right up. I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black-Eyed Peas. It's rock and roll for people who don't like rock and roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop. Ah, heartbreaking. Oh, thank you. Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off and put on my hard ass hat, butThis is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless wants to switch desk clumps. Fine with me. Jim can leave any time he wants. - Good-bye. - Wasn't me. It wasn't either of you. Kathy wants to leave our clump? Don't look. Who it was is not important. But she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he. I just want to say this is not my fault. Okay, the weak always bully the strong, contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. - Ow, what are you doing? - Hey! Hey! Respect the hat. Pam never seemed to have a problem with us. All right. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand, Monet. - What? - What is? Money. You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person. - Can't do that. - No, absolutely not. You need consequences. Okay, I want you both walking on eggshells. Hi, I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy. Jessica, yes. We don't say hi. We hug. I'm Erin. - I-- Oof. - Sorry. I hope you feel really welcome. - We all want you here. - Oh. My ex is meeting my sex. Which is always scary. You know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis. That's just part of it. Hey! Jess, Erin. I hope you're not talking about my penis. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, everyone, I want you to meet Jessica. She is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr. Wow. Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist. Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office. Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess. - What? - Oh. Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years, but I never did. Oh, no. Oh, no, it's kicking in. - SpontaneousScoliosis. - Spontaneous scoliosis. Oh. This thing could take your arm off, your head off. You know, just exercise caution. - Thank you. - All right. All right. Oh, yeah, and, um There's a Christmas party upstairs tonight I wanted to tell you about. Isn't that just for popsicles? Popsicles? Yeah, like, upstairs people. 'Cause you got a stick up your butt. See, I thought it was because they're all so rich they could eat popsicles all the time. What? I-- In my-- Well, you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know, cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid. You had me at "clookies." I can't wait to find out what they are. What should I wear? Oh, it's nice. It's real nice. People get dressed up. I will look so handsome for you, Darryl. Ah I'm gonna s-- Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh, God, now I can't drink at this thing. I get really pranky when I drink. Erin, what can I get for you? Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland, if you have it. Why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots. - Oh. - Yes. Will do. The fifth one is for you, Erin. You can take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine, too. - One, two, three. - Yes. - Mm. - Whoa. - Hey, hey, nice. - Whoo! Jiminy Christmas! Jiminy Christmas, indeed. - Hit 'er up. - Oh, yes. - Whoo! - Yeah. Yeah, I just got my replacement credit card. Do you want the number-- Oh, it's 4-7-9-3 The security code is 927. Okay, great, thank you very much. Bye. So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a $200 bouquet of flowers To my wife. From me. Boom! Look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed-- Whoa, hello.   I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghostbuster. Okay. I thought you'd wear a sweater. Since when does a sweater mean "dressed up"? Am I your grandson? Come on, stay, all right? It's good for people to get to know you. As a contestant on dancing with the stars, maybe. I want my sugar-free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. And then I want my nap. That's right. Thank you. She is remarkable. - Edgy impressions. - Thank you. How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home. - A thousand. - Whoa! Maybe you should take a break. Maybe you should mind your own business. Just kidding. Ah, I've been attacked! Oh, my God. Oh, someone put a porcupine in my drawer. Oh, my God. Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk, and I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder, and-- and all of a sudden, I was attacked by this bloodthirsty rabid creature. I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine? Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up? Hm, you know, this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flenderman novel, a murder for framing. Chad Flenderman. Just an easy-going black guy who knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh, and he's also the world's leading egyptologist. Toby, nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective. No, no, no, no, no, women chase him. H-he misses his wife. Hello, lacerated hand here, folks. Nice try. This is ridiculous. Oh, is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe that I was being recruited by the CIA. - Three times, actually. - You see? Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it. Andy, you've got to be kidding me. Fingerprints can be planted. You know, with a severed hand-- Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand? Okay, you know what, why don't we just call Animal Control? You might want to run that by Angela. 'Cause it's so cute. No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs. Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office. Someone should come pick it up. Come down right away. Uh, I don't know, let me ask. Uh, were you quilled? Yes, I was quilled. - And what's its name? - Henrietta. - Oops. - What? All right. Get her out of here, Dwight.   Guys, I just wanted to say-- Come here. I am so happy you guys are together. Okay? And you both have such beautiful hair. Thank you. I hope you guys get married. And who knows? Maybe at the wedding I meet someone. Okay. And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. Yay. Okay, well, I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say "get a drink." That's, uh, that's the girl you dated. Um, yeah, she's not really like that. It's No, she-- she seems fun. - Yeah, uh, excuse me. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes? - Every Martini has an olive. - Okay. Maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something. I don't want to put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take an apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk. Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish. - Okay. - It's about you. That's not what it should be. It should just be like a trinket or something. I'd said I wish Jessica was dead. You-- you mean you wish she wasn't here or something. I wish she was in a graveyard under the ground with worms coming out of her mouth. Hey, you know, you can't say that, okay? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it. Take your wish back. Too late. It's already been wished. And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So which one are you, a murderer or a liar?   - Hey - Hey. So there was talk of oatmeal. You know? Don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a A princess. - Yeah. - Thanks. I was too embarrassed. Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt. I, uh, just found this on my desk and need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that? - Is that Cece? - Yes, it is. - Oh, man. - That's awful. - Cece is Jim's daughter. - Oh, my God. How could somebody do that? I know. I mean, the way I see it is, you can deface any picture of me. Any one. Pick one. Not my kid, though. Who did this? Who did this? - Do you know who did this? - I don't I know who did this. Dwight. - Dwight? - Yeah, he did. - What? No. - He should pay. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able. - Okay. - It's-- I mean-- Let me just see it one more time. You know what? I know who my friends are now. But I shouldn't have got you involved. Because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture. It's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like That's no accident. Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it. By accident. - What? - I'll figure it out. Get to the bottom of it. Merry merry. Enough of this garbage. This is Christmas.   Hiya!   Christmas! You all right, Santa? You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends? Yes. Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends? Two friends who are not sleeping together? Can they remain friends? Yes, yeah. No. I-- Mm, I don't know. - Okay. - By the way, I'm not gonna mess with your and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work. All right. I will definitely do that. All right. I'll tell Dwight. You know what? You're sitting and thinking. And it's probably better if it comes from me anyway. Christmas miracles do happen. Yes, they totally do. You can't click on these Kardashian links. That's why you have so many viruses. Well, help me, okay? I'm trying, but-- - You need to-- - Kelly. - Yo. - Game on. On it. I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful. Jessica, did you just fart? And that is how it's done. I would like another alcohol. Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar. What? I haven't bartended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist. Oh, this is daunting. Uh, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler. Does anyone have any chocolate shavings? Your heart is broken. So's mine. And? And what? And do you have any advice or anything Oh, my God. To help me feel better? I've been married thrice, and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce. I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice. Oh. I was hoping you were going to make me feel better. - When you do your make-up - Uh-huh? How long does it take usually? 'Cause Um, it-- it depends. Chad Flenderman's kryptonite-- Whoa, we got a real Clarence Thomas here. - I'll see you at home. - Okay, great. - Perfect. - Bye. I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it. I would, it just-- That wasn't the holiday wish. Either he drives or I drive, and now I'm drunk and mad. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. All right, come on, Meredith. Bye. Thank you, Santa. You bet. Thank God Erin's getting a ride home with Robert, 'cause she is trashed. And who better to drive her home than Robert? I mean, what a standup guy, you know? I mean, he's going through a lot-- Separating from his wife, showing up at the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer. - Let's go, let's go. - I'm coming, I'm coming. - I'm coming, I'm coming. - Hang on. All right. - Whoa! My stuff! - What? What is all that? - It's my valuables! - It's junk. This is my treasures-- No, they're my treasures! You're a hoarder. My God! No, I'm not! I'm gonna sell it on eBay! No, no, no, you be careful. - Be careful! - Ah! My Santa suit's stuck. What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta, huh? Where are we? This ain't my street. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Mmm, this is the posh part of town, huh? Oh, my God. Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood. Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now. Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin, drink a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning. Thank you. Good night. What are you smiling for? You thinking what I'm thinking? I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home. Ow! Take it easy! Whoo. Oh, man! Ah, fell asleep. Took a nap. Hey, guys. I feel refreshed now. - How's it going? - Dwight. Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at? Oh, man! I was supposed to tell Dwight something. Come on, Jim I got nothing.
Oh, yeah. - Aw! - Knew it! Knew it! As soon as I heard that wrapper. You really have to say "oh yeah," every time you eat a candy bar? I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. Oh, yeah. All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat So let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to. It was a raccoon eating a hamburger like a person! You need to stop banging your pen on your desk, or it's going to drive me insane. Okay, got it. Does anyone have a first aid kit? Check out this song I wrote,  I'ma love you downstairs tonight  I find it hard to believe that no one here - All right, here we go. -  Love you downstairs  Everybody get ready in three Two, good luck, one Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper? You can write a book about chairs. Books! Excellent, Jim. Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-- So we Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? Yeah! Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is. I'm talking about you guys! Who, in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply! Andy, you want us to buy our own paper? Yes! Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to 8% by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we are $830 short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So, today, we need to sell $830 of paper, and, the next quarter, I need to sell the $2,200 of paper that's in my garage. Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed, is people. I saw in an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it, and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine. Dwight Schrute for Robert California! Hello, Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all? I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine. Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please, have a seat. Dwight? What are you doing here? Gabe? You don't know? Course I know. Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office. Corporate says to me, "Gabe, we need you in Scranton." Scranton says, "Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there." So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, wednesdays, and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying. - Dwight. - Robert. - You made it. - Yes. Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. Well, uh Let me settle in, and I'll be with you shortly. Very good. - Hey, C-SPAN. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to "play ball." Those were his words. Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. $800 is, uh, a rounding error. So make that error! - Andy, no-- - Hey! I can make that error. Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that. - No, I-- - I just, I really need a real accountant on this. What do you say? I'm leaving early today because tonight, I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia. Oh. Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you, so you can save face in front of your ceo, but tonight is Triviocalypse! What? It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a $1,000 prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me. You know what? Go. Have fun. There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia. - Stop right there. I love it. - I'm in. I didn't even say what it is. - It's trivia. - In Philadelphia. But here's the best part. The prize is $1,000, and, if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our 8% profit increase - That's a good idea. - That's a great plan. - Yeah? You like it? - Yeah. - All right. - All right, good stuff. I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought, I was like, "this sounds really stupid." You just made a good idea a great idea. There is one problem with this plan. What? We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this. You can reduce your prices by 10%, or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. Gabe, I always wondered what it is you do around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy. Yeah, but not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question, what's the most important appliance in your house? - Meat grinder. - Too slow. It's the toilet. And, I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean, and, just like a toilet, I am essential. You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator, or eraser, and instead, you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic. Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid, I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO. But I can give you this pitch in one minute. No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I, I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight. CEO to COO, what a difference a letter makes. Still an important position. Still a chief. You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking. Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait 20 minutes, and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued, make him feel heard. - Your wish is my command. - It's a command. I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy? You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you. What? No! I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it. And you guys thought this was a good idea? I thought it was a fun idea. There were times on the 2 1/2 hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to-- this is a gay bar. Wait, what? - Everyone in here is gay? - Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now? Nah. What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? It says that I believe in my staff's intelligence, and that I'm willing to try anything. Not anything. Good luck. Uh, all right we need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all, so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team, and a just-have-fun team. So, you guys all know yourselves. Good-timers follow me. Backups. Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here. A-team. - Okay. - All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except - Okay. - There's a table over here. All right, first question everyone, Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital? Oh, we got this! Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer, where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. - Alaska? - Atlanta. Oh, I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held. My cousins were actually at those Olympics. Keep talking all you want. How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Oh, what do blind people think about? Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness. Okay, time's up. Let's get the boards up. "Atlanta, Georgia" is the correct answer. Hey, man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so, your appointment got There're no fires within eight miles of here. Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf. What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant! This must be very frustrating. I can see you in the jungle now. Hey now, you're not an All-Star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA's sixth man of the year award in 2011. Who are you? Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine. - Shawn Marion. - Yes, Shawn Marion. That doesn't sound right. I want to say, Ladameon Washington. Wrong, for so many reasons. Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful? That's it, I'm going to go watch the boats on the river. - Ron Artest, Kelly. - No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing With The Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning sixth man was a big storyline on Chloe And Lamar. All right, boards up. Let's see who got it. "Lamar Odom" is what we were looking for. "Lamar Odom." Thank you. Lamar Odom, yes. You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN classic. Ryan is MSNBC.I'm E!, TLC, and Oxygen. Chill, man. This plan is airtight. So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it! Well, you got my vote. - Oh, my God. - I know. Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that-- Wait, why are you smiling? - What? - What's with the smile? You're doing great. You know, so good. And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us. Dwight? That was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! Ow! Take me to Robert. - Ow! He went home. - Take me to his house. Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing. You know where it is. Lead me there. Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help! Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go. Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir? I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account. But, you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules. Okay, I'm turning it off. Okay, you're not turning it off. I, I won't look at it. - Sir? - I can't-- I can't not touch it. Okay, then we're going to have to take it away. Thank you. Look I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. All right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. Dunder-Mifflin A-team has four points. - All right. - D.M. Backup team has 3 points. The Einsteins have eight points. Ladies Gaga have five points. So, the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin, and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no. - Which one is it? - I don't know! All I know is the building. Robert! Robert California! Robert! Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102. All right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh, wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. The top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round so, let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins. - Oh, yeah! - What?! In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears. Whoo! Let's go! And, in first place, is Aesop's Foibles. Whoo! We're going to get clobbered. Ring it in when you know it. First question, this man had a fatwa declared on him, when-- Einsteins? - What? - What is it? - What? - I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. Aesop's? Salman Rushdie. Salman Rushdie is correct. Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sail set furthest forward is called what? Princess ding-dong, do not hit - that bell unless-- - Flying jib. Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins. Shalom. Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. I could go to this gym three times a week, or I can wrestle Stu once a month. Grab my knee! Yay, Robert! Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge. According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents. - Boom! ADHD. - No. Wrong. The answer is dyslexia! That's correct for the Einsteins. Whoo! Yeah! Go Einsteins! Dial it back, this isn't tail feathers, okay? They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they? No, thank you. Sit down, Dwight. Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle A manager, a salesman, a leader, and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, "table for one?" How is this possible? You were dining alone? All those people are you? Yes, exactly. Riddle number two - Who is going-- - Your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job, and Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right? N it's complicated. This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? It's a job interview, not a flea market. Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place. Yes. Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you're ready to play doctor. Our question is about the health and the human body. Oh, come on! The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight? Point for the Einsteins! Here's your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory berets This 2001 masterpiece, from Gilles Paquet-Brenner, explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray. It's the film Le Scaphandre Et Le Papillon. I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins. Les Jolies Choses. - Are you sure? - Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film. The Einsteins win it. No! Come on! Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia A fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So, if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one. Welcome to Stonewall Alliance trivia championships! First prize is $4,500 dollars! Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home. - Riboflavin. - Riboflavin? Michigan. The President of the United States is POTUS. John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes Of Wrath.
Oh What is this? A A meatball? Really? It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam. So, now that she's out, I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I found out what he likes. And it's really weird. Jim, come on. So juvenile. What the You've been meatballed. Ugh. Are you ready for some meatball? Oh, man. This is not very clever, Jim. I know. Look for your stapler. Really, Jim? Really? Very funny. What's our haul? Good day. That idiot's been feeding us for a week. We'll never have to buy meatballs again. Dunder Mifflin. Jessica. Hi, how are you? Oh, yay, that's so great to hear. I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life, and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far, I have learned tortellini, spaghettini, linguini-- Well, it's not so much a class as a restaurant. But I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 7:00 to 9:00. I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay. Jessica, I love you. That's a message from my mom. My parents met Jessica, and they completely flipped for her, so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa, pump the brakes, Bernard, too early, I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years. Mom took the main diamond out. She thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but Ooh. Looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of The Shining vibe, though. Oh, who needs a house that size? Big, stupid, pure chump bait. I'm selling the house, actually. You know, there's a glare from over here. Oh, wow. That's magnificent. It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state, and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The 1% are suffering too, people. I bought it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue. This was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife. She moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult-- They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim? I'm sorry. I thought you were making a joke. What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard? I guess I thought that you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain. - Sad clown thing. - Oh, yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it. Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here. A beautiful monster cost me my 40s and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day. Well, please tell Susan we all say hi. Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight - and check out your indoor pool? - Kevin, no. What, as some sort of last hoorah? Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it. You know? I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this. Everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food. Hey, Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air, or was it me? That was you, Kevin. It was me. You going tonight, kiddo? 'Cause I can give you a lift. Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever. It's no problem. You live right near me. How do you know where I live? Andy followed you home after the Christmas party. Why? He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you. Oh. Come on. Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. Oh, it's warm. It's almost too warm. I'm feeling 82, 82 1/2. Oh, so close. Well, we'll say it's 82, and it'll be our secret. - Hey, late guy. - Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party. - Oh. - DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight. You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. The key is you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but, new year's eve, I was home by 9:00. Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way. You should see the whole thing. I bet I should. That's beautiful. I'm gonna email that to you. I'm just about to give the tour. - All right. - Join us. - Well - You must see what you were laughing about. I must. Wow. Yeah. It's pretty serious poolage. - What are you doing? - Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. Gross. I'm getting a drink. - Do you want anything? - No, I'm good. Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. - Hi. - Hi. How is everything? How's your car? It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage. Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain? Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. You know, a couple of dopes on the slopes. Oh, like a good-bye trip. No. What? - Hey. - Hi. I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But if he was jealous once before, then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him. Val. You made it. - Yup, yup. - Uh-oh. Look at this. Red plastic cup Red plastic cup. How about that? You know, you are just as dumb at night. Mm. All right, there's-- This would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath. No. Show me. - Okay. - Dive in right here. In a minute. In a minute. You don't know what you're doing. A minute would be cool. Hey, Dwight snoot. - What-- - What you doing? I'm relaxing. Scram. Hey, Stanley. What happened to my pants? I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them. Where Come on. Don't you want to play? - Oh, really? - Yeah. Yeah, you want to play, you little hick? - Whoa. - Dwight! - Oh, my gosh. - Dwight! Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a pilates studio. Holy cow. Wine collection. How many bottles? About 1,200. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers. Toby. Chateau Margaux '95. You know your wine. Well, and you have a Yes, a-- Another Chateau. - Robert, you are too kind. - Oh. "Too kind" doesn't begin to cover it. With ammunition like this, we are in for quite a night, you and me. And Gabey makes three. Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical. Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it. Really? Why? I don't know. Maybe not. Just come. Oh! You regret attacking me now, hick, huh? Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous. I'm not gonna help you. And why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? 'Cause I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. Oh, Dwight. - Stop. - You stop. - No, you stop. - No, you stop. Is he looking? Oh. You can stop. - Okay, you can stop. - No, no, no, he's not looking. - No, you can stop. - You can actually stop. Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this? The main stone's missing. I don't know. It looks pretty great to me. I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan. - Good night. - To the kitchen. To the kitchen. To the kitchen. Onward. Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. - Right? - Note? It's a symphony. Okay, you have to join my wine tasting club. I would love that. Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. I guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right? You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it. You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice. You in? Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in. I've been working out. But the problem is I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, and rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh, that's so good. Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end. Damn it. What is the most romantic possible thing? We can get some chicken fights going in the pool. Dwight, that's just-- That's really perfect. Thank you. Yes! You're in my way! Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all. - Chicken fight! - No, thanks. Dang it. What the heck already? Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight! Okay, yeah. Who's gonna be my partner? Where's Jim? I'm right here. Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath. - Yea-- Oh! - Yes! Whoo-hoo! Yes! Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together. I know. I could just bang you right now. He's not looking. Hey! I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears. - To both these bears. - To both these bears. - Bears. - To both these bears. When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies-- Caligula, Last Tango In Paris, and Emmanuelle II. Mwah. Last two movies I actually watched in here were Marley & Me and On Golden [Bleep] Pond. I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema. Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just-- If you have the cables. Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found. Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad that I found it. I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all? Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about? The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly? Oh, I don't think you're being silly. Oh, God. You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund. Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. - We have to destroy it. - Come on. Let's chicken fight those two. Okay. - How was that? - Okay. Watch my toes. Val. You want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking. No, I'm good. Thank you. - Cool. - Cool. Does Darryl not swim? That's racist. I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim. - Yes! - Yeah! Maybe we should take a little break. Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what. Okay. - One more? - Yeah. Great. Mush, mush, mush. - Come on. - Go. - Go. - Okay. Yeah. Here we go. - Yes! - Yay! - Yes! - Whoa! Wow. I cannot believe you're still up. - I can't believe it either. - I've got this. Charge! Go! Go! Dwight, are you okay? Are you okay? Hey, damn it-- Erin, did we win? Sure. Sure, we did. You're lying. We didn't win. Hey. Hey, Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest. You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. We're in the pool. - Shut it, Angela. - Shh. Ugh, same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday. Do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday. I know. But, boy, that Erin, she sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rraaaw! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar - Angela kind of situation. - Mm. So I just want to make sure that you are completely, Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog in me. - Not what I asked. - We're done. Erin and I are over. So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex. Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out. You're an idiot. Kelly That is mine-- - This is mine. - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. - No. - Oh, I've got him. Cannonball! Let's do this. - Wow. - So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours. Yeah. Oh, wow. How did you know it was mine? The Bernard family seal. Duh. Duh. Sorry if your special night was ruined. Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night. Oh, you weren't going to do that? Honestly, Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I I just I don't know. Thank you. Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused. And of course the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness. To madness. - To madness. - To madness. To madness. To madness! Hey, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van? I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl. - Are you serious? - Robert, I want you to know I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man. And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like. Toby! I am Bacchus, God of wine. And I am Bacchus' friend. Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. Bravo! Yes! Whoo-hoo! Oh, yes. And there's my talking point. - Whoo-hoo! Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need to breathe air. You two keep going. Hey, he is asleep. We can just leave. So leave.
Val, I need this space. All right, guys, clear out. Everybody out. Promise me you're going to clean up. I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do. Promise me that-- Obviously I'm going to clean up. Stress is like the uptight mayor of a town who's saying, "hey, we're uptight, you can't dance." And then you have to be like, "oh, yeah, mayor stress? Well, watch this." And thenWe dance. Oh, how we dance.   I've been working so hard   I'm punching my card   eight hours for what   oh tell me what I got   I've got this feeling   that time's just holding me down  Sex also works. Hey, Jim's back from jury duty. Hey! Tuna! He's back. - Hey. - Oh, look at this. - Tuna wrap. - Okay. Hand roll. Yeah. How was jury duty? It was pretty uneventful, actually. I can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system. What was the case? Uh, hit and run. Ooh, "the case of the hit and run," that's exciting. Did you send him to the slammer? Nope, not guilty. Of course you found him not guilty. "Oh, he apologized, and I just really want him to like me, mm." We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come. Not coming, have plans. Okay. I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning, Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids, so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened. Ah! Angela had the baby! Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious. Why? You know. Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby? A little bit, yeah. Right, guys? Back me up. Eh, a little bit. Oh, did I win the pool? Ah, no. Right month, wrong year. Well, no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month. We should all go to the hospital and visit her. Oh, I'd love to, but, um-- Aw, man, I would, but I can't miss any more work. Well, Kevin and I have to go, because accounting is its own little family. Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad, and Angela's my mom. Everyone, our very own Angela-- We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit. Oh, I am so in. I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right. Come on, "Judge Judy," tell us your case. What were the deets? Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-- How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us. Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until 6:00 twice to cover for you. My wife got to the tv first, had to sit through damn "Rizzoli" and damn "Isles." Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients, and I had to have it detailed, and they took my meter change. - Wow, I'm really sorry. - Yeah. I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story. So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did-- He was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually. You know, when I was on j-duty-- Uh, strangler case-- We used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from-- At Ernesto's. Oh, man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too. You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck. Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas. I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them "restaurants." Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen-- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive. Got that, bimbo? Got it, bimbo. Yes? Knock, knock. Hi. I don't-- I don't want any-- What are you guys doing here? We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite. Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton. Philip is so fat. Kevin. You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby. - Hey. - Yes, he's substantial. He's more than substantial. He's a monster. So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop Mm-hm. And the victim rode his bicycle into the left-hand turn lane, but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane? Mm-hm. See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. - Busted, Halpert! - Okay, wait, wait. - Yes! Andy, get out here. - No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you. I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights. What's up, gangstas? Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him! Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory. I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-- No, Dwight! I have me on the record saying to you, "take a chill pill." I don't-- I don't need to take a chill pill. Here, right there. Down the hatch. I really don't want to take the chill pill. Attaboy. Good, now, "chill." Okay, okay. But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right? Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. That's good enough for me. And Pam was just going crazy trying to take care of Philip, because Cece has been out of control recently, and-- Look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you. I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before. Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth. No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No, here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up? No. Do you know why you never heard of it? - No. - Covered it up. Are you sure you can keep this under wraps? They used to call me "King Tut" because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps. My nickname was actually "King Butt," because I had a king-size butt. Where do you want I park? Okay, everybody, gather around. Got a real special surprise for you. Ernesto. Hola, Toby. - Yeah, hey. - Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡? Recuerdo muy bien al seÃ±or Toby, el fue un cliente muy bueno. Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of, "he says, 'blah blah blah, '" I'm going to say, "I say, 'blah blah blah, '" but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "he remembers Toby." "I remember Toby." Okay-- Oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar? It's the empanada guy. - The empanada guy. - No, Toby! Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. Ask him if he remembers Jim. Â¿Conoce el Jaime? No. - He says, "no." - He says, "no"! Boom! Yeah, but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name, like, three of our clients. Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. Yo no quiero problemas, yo veo a mucha gente. Vienen de todas partes a comer mis empanadas. Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people. They come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets. Uh, you guys are going to love these. So empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them. Usually I'm a "burrito guy," but if you won't tell, I won't, "wink, wink." Great, and while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again? Why? Everybody's heard it. Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning? Hey, murder, she wrote. How about we drop the whole murder, she wrote thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there. Why? Why? Why? Because my car broke down. His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse. Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse? And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning, and that was that. I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food? We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down? Well, I think you handled it pretty well. I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [Bleep]. Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth. I don't even know what the truth is anymore. Wow, it's so healthy. I'm going to call him "Little Kevin." No, you will not. - Is he really five pounds? - Mm-hmm. Because I squat with five pounds. This-- Yeah, this feels like more than that. No, no, no. He's nine pounds, seven ounces. Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So what did you bring? Oh, yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-- Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park. Oh, "preemie pajamas." Again, it may not be the right size. - I can return-- - No. I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you. I got Little Kevin Call Of Duty. This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow. Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off. What? Funny? No? Nobody laughing? You're screwed. Oh, it's happening. It's really happening. What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt. Pam really needed some help with the kids, so-- I promise my intentions were good. Your clients. They're all mine. Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse. Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die. All right, well Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim. No, no, no, no. You said-- You said you were-- I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. That's it? This is crap! You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message, ciao. Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me immediately. That means A-S-A-P. I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did, and let the little stickler do what he does best, stickle. Shh. Honestly, I can return this for a larger size. It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio. The only premature baby in this room, is the baby this baby ate. Ah. Little Kevin. - Really? - Angela. Fine. God. Philip was conceived nine months ago. I knew that, I knew it. The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor, and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata. Chicken marsala. Right. Um, point is Philip was conceived out of wedlock. Mm-hm. And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious. Dwight. Hey. Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe? He went to the car or something, but he'll back. Okay. Don't you want to see the baby? Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now. I promised I wouldn't tell. So don't. Angela got pregnant before the wedding what? She got pregnant before the wedding. How long before? A month. You didn't hear it from me. Yes, I did.. - Dwight? - Dwight. I want to see the baby. Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it. Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions Willingly or as slaves. That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine. He's hungry. Oh, that's my cue to leave. No, you don't have to, I'm going to wear this cover. Still. Still. You won't see-- You want a giraffe? Yes, I am bringing my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam. Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here. Whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face. Oh, right, okay. "Hey, Stanley, it's great to see you"! Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think. "Oh, hi, Stanley." Split the difference? - Jim-- - Okay, let's go. - Hey. - Hi. Hi, everybody! What? Hey, how about a little visit? Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers. Hey, Angela's back with her baby. Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip. You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does. Let me have a turn. No, it's the pacifier's turn. All right. Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people? Yes. Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat. Cookies? No, but that would've been a really good idea. That was a great idea. No, she brought you drawings. Oh, my goodness. Let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. - Uncle Andy. - Oh. Oh, aunt Phyllis. Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these? No. She says "no" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is "no." Cece, do you want some broccoli? Yes. No. It's crazy. Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to? - There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a 2-year-old. Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture? No. So then this means nothing to you. Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style? You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. - Right? - Mama. Shh. I don't know what else we can do here. Mama, mama, mama. - Oh, it's okay, sweetie. - All right, all right. It's okay, honey. It's okay. It's okay. All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this. - Shh. - Mama! Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me. Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby. Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding? That is completely untrue. Completely true. - Remember? - No. You said that Robert was not fulfilling you - I did not. Unh-uh. - And I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls. That didn't happen. And then I inserted my penis - No! Stop it. - Into your Dwight. Vagina, and-- And even if it did, it's just a coincidence. - Admit that there is a chance. - I will not. - Admit it, admit it. - I will not, it's not--. All done? - Yes, yes. - Yeah. - Mm. - He's sleeping. Before I go, may I? Sure. Watch the head, watch the head. Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision. Who are you? I just might be his father. I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him. I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out? - No. - Oh, bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything? I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier. Cece. - Okay, we're going. - Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home. We're going home. - I know, I know, bud. - Shh, shh, shh. I know. I know. - You want to grab her? - I'm gonna grab her, okay. - Here we go, here we go. - Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car, and I'm going to put her in her seat, and I'll be right back up. We'll see you tomorrow. No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back. No, just go home. It's all good, we got this. I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation. Jim, just go. Hey, we'll be just fine. Thanks, guys. All right, here we go, let's go. Oh, whew. Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here. Oh, right. The office looks different now. Hm, smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello, Gabe. You had something important to tell me? Oh, you know, I did, but now it seems infinitely insignificant. Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
Oh, look who's back reporting for duty. Hey, guys. Hey. Hey, Pam, ah! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. Bam, bam, bam, bam. Are you glad to be back? Yeah-- Yeah, I mean I could have used another week or three. You still had eight weeks more than we did. Well, it's not exactly a vacation. - Hello, everyone. - Hey. Remember? Little old me, hi. What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective, Dunder Mifflin family baby. Four days ago. I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long, luxurious, - Parisian maternity leave. - What? Damn, girl, your body. Angela, you look amazing. Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me, so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars. Nice. Oh, Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right, Kevin? Extremely, but I'm going to fight through it. Aw, it's okay, Angela. I have mommy-brain too. I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you, Kevin. - It's right here. - Ooh. When did you find time to do all this? Babies sleep a lot, Pam. If you feed them enough. Brownie, Pam? Thank you. Oh, my gosh, it's really good. - is cash, so-- - Nope, it's over. - We wanted to say thank you-- - Nope. Okay. Dwight, I have exciting news for you. What? I think you're going to like it. You can't tantalize me. Oh, maybe I can. I got an e-mail from corporate - okay. - That told me that you got a promotion. Right? I mean, that's not the kind of thing you want to read quietly at your desk. If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear. No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The Schrutes have a word for when everything in a man's life comes together perfectly. Perfectenschlag. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate. I am assembling a competent team. I am likely a father. I am so deep inside of perfectenschlag right now. And, just to be clear, there is a second definition, "perfect pork anus," which I don't mean. And here's the fax for you. And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes. Love to learn. Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one. So Uh, yeah, look at that. - We're pin twins. - Pin twins. This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift, really. Real gifts come later. Yeah, that's cute. When I saw it in CVS, it made me gag too. For awhile there, I thought something would change, but, nope, Andy's still with Jessica. They even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy. But I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica. What do we have here? Val knit me a beanie. But I can't tell if it's a "we're just friends" beanie or a "I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it popping" beanie. So I'm going to up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift. And we'll get to the meaning of the beanie. Pam, pack up your postnatal swimwear, make it a one-piece, or this offer is rescinded, and join me for a fantastic barbecue, one week from today, in Tallahassee, Florida, where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I'll fly anywhere for some good barbecue. Ooh, me three. No plus-ones. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill. Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about? God, you're such a spy. Notice anything different about me? You're wearing the beanie. You like it? Super comfortable, like sweatpants for my head. I love it too, Val. It's really itchy, but to be fair, my head is constantly itching. So I can't really peg it on the hat. Wow, it's like the nation of islam down here. I like to knit. Don't hate. And who's that for? Oh, this is a gift for my man, Nate, here. - What? - Yeah. Darryl, you shouldn't have. - Can I open it? - No, no, no, maybe just-- Ah, I can't wait, I'm sorry, I'm too excited. Darryl. Wow, those are really nice. - They're so elegant. - Cashmere. How'd you know? Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way. Can't wait. I'm glad you're in my life, happy Valentine's day. Oh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Your card is more beautiful than the gloves. My first task as Special Project Manager, Dwight Schrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who will help me get an inroad with the gay-hispanic community. People who won't be missed. - We don't need idiots. - This hurts. Good for nothings. Meth-heads. Or-- What's your name? Kathy. Kathy. I just got a text from Robert California that says, "bring your clubs to Florida." Why? Does he think you're going to Florida? I hope not, because I am not going. Two question marks. No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know, it's like, "wh-- what?" Just do one. You want to take Darryl, Phyllis, - Toby, Angela, and Oscar? - Yes. Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like a-- A Creed or a Meredith perhaps? - Oh, my God. - They're not expendable, exactly, I just can't-- I can't think of the word I'm trying to find. Are you kidding me? I'm supposed to get on an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never make it off the runway. All right, look, I got to keep this office functioning somehow, so-- I have put together a list. Here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis, you can have. But you're also taking Kathy, Kelly, and Kevin. Oh, God. You have your team. Kevin? Kelly? Kathy? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have, and now I no longer own an arctic wolf. Well, let's hear it. "Robert, hey!" Exclamation point. I like it so far. "Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links the next time you're in PA." Dash, JH. It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida. Yeah, it's a golf text. Total golf text, send it. Done-- Wait, I just feel weird. I should just call him. You want to call someone that texted you? Do you want to drive them away? I mean--? This is Darryl. Oh, sorry, I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse. I want to send my girlfriend some flowers. Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val? Yeah, do you know her? We're friends, we're friends. Cool. Uh, so can I get that address or--? Yeah, yeah, sorry, I'm just looking for a pen. Why do you need a pen? Back off. I got my reasons. May I have your attention, please? Could Kathy, Phyllis, Darryl, Kevin, and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately. - Why? - Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three-week, all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida. Hell, yeah. What? Oh, I'm sorry, Stanley. I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you. Wait, Kathy gets to go? Why does she even still work here? Pam is back. It just feels like a slap in the face. I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons. We're not questioning his reasons. I just want to know what they are. I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kind of random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime. Well, he nailed it. Because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's got to take off his cape. Good point, but we're going to be working pretty hard until 5:00 P.M. After that, it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea-kayaking with Gloria Estefan. What were the criteria for going? It might be innate goodness versus innate badness. But there's an easy way to find out. Oh, Andy, got a few questions for you. Moshi moshi. Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked, and maybe you could just clarify. Uh, well, the deliberations were confidential, so I feel like we should respect that. Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson? Hey. Okay, it's obvious that Andy picked the people that are least important to the office. Important? Oh, because you and your enormous monster-baby are so important to the branch. My baby is not a monster. Hey, be proud of your enormous monster-baby. I was once an enormous monster-baby. Guys, guys, guys, come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys. Stop calling us "guys." I use the word "guys" a lot when I'm nervous. Guys. - Guys, guys, guys. - Andy, please. Stop it, Andy. - Dudes-- - Andy. The dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me. Okay, hey, I specifically remember that there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered. If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt that I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice. Okay, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly. So if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out. Great idea. So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida, and Andy and I will listen to it. No, that is a ridiculous waste of time. For you, maybe. - Five to six hours? - Three to four hours. - No, no, no, no. - Just two to three hours-- come up with a statement over the next hour. I'm out. Okay, read it back to me. "Robert, great offer." Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida, but a father of a newborn really should be helping out "his wife any chance he gets." Good, doesn't sound pushy. You're just stating a fact. Absolutely. Works for me. - Okay, sending. - Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning. We really did. He responded "LOL." I have a new swimsuit I need to break in. I already picked my team. Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis, and Toby. And that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Glattfielder had, and now no one eats owls for Thanksgiving. You have two young, dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor. You need one of us there. Or both. Not both. Just one. Me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally, me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your Special Project Team. Or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks. Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat. Because I feel like that I'm at a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport. Maybe putting down a few dollars, if there's, like, a crazy mismatch or something. Okay, thank you, Kevin. We'll let you know. - Thank you. - When do we leave? Thank you. It has been a long, lonely winter. Wow, seasonal affective disorder, aka, "SAD." That sounds like a very real thing, Toby. It is real. Thank you for saying that. Yeah, wow, it's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter. "Florida Stanley" smiles. "Florida Stanley" is happy to go to work. "Florida Stanley" is who you want on your Florida team. It's still, well-- Hey, guys, any spots left? Erin, you want to go to Tallahassee? I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head. You know, I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head anymore than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality. Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go. Well, it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in. Really? Oh, great, good. Now, is it too dark to say that Cece's having an operation? I think you need to go to Florida. I think you're right. It's only for three weeks. You know, with my mom and sister at the house it'll be-- - A total nightmare. - I was going to say, "good, because I'll have all the help I need." Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful. You're lucky to have them. I mean, with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone. Exactly. Well-- No, no, absolutely not. You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Tunes, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here. I can't let you go. I wouldn't say that. That's a bit much. You know, Dwight, if you didn't want me to go, the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go. Jim is essential to-- Hold on, just want to get it on camera. Andy, Jim is just too ess-- Essential. This is stupid. Cut. All right, I'm going to pack my trunks. He doesn't even want to go. Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down, so I think that's going to make us roommates. Oh, my God. Hey, quick question. Do you shower at night or do you shower in the morning? Because I want to shower when you're showering to save some water. Okay, listen up, everyone. Here's who's going to Florida. - Kathy. - What? - Stanley. - No. - Ryan. - No. - Erin. - Fuck. And Jim. You got to be fucking kidding me. Okay, okay. Florida group, welcome to the team. Aah! Let's go. Step it up, you runts. Infants, let's move. Why is it so hot in here? Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice, temperate, Florida morning. This is the exact environment that you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to Special Projects Orientation. The next three weeks of your life are going to be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're going to be hard, they're going to be dirty. You're going to wish you were dead. But. But? There's no buts. That's it, you'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, do you want to stay here? No, no, I want to go. Because if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. Is that the buzzer from Taboo? - Shut up, maggot! - It is. You don't want to go, ring the bell. Ring it, ring it. How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance? How did a mosquito get in here? I released 300 mosquitoes into the conference room. Just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. Yes, then he brushes your soft, supple cheeks with his worn, leathery hands and says, "I'm going to make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt." Unless you ring the bell, ring it. - No. - Ring the bell. You want to spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh, do you? Ring it. Ah. What was that? Mosquito. Orientation's over. Oh, Darryl, hey. Hey, what's up? You called? Yeah, you know, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything. It's cool, really. No, it's anything but cool. Now, I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but here goes. - "This coupon entitles you to one free tickle-monster attack." Yeah, they're Nate coupons, or "Na-pons," and they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum. Any time, any place. I'll find you. Thanks. Nice flowers. Thanks, they're from my mom. - Your mom? - Yeah. Oh, so I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep-voiced woman. Yeah, that's her. She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon? Yeah, Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon. I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie. Okay, Florida Team, let's reconvene. I'm going to Florida and I'm not coming back. So Sabre has setup a conference room for our use while we're at corporate. So what is this Special Project? Basically, Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to setup their own version of an Apple Store. That sounds awesome. It did, it did. You know what might be great is if instead of a genius bar, we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it. Yeah, and they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. Oh, don't write it down unless you like it. Oh, I like it. It seems to me that the Apple Store is kind of like a party, so I think our question is, "how do we make this a better party?" No, we sell business tools, and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store. Right, think different from Apple. Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us? Yes. What are my expectations for the group? I had been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player. Ryan, who is capable of surprises. Erin, an excellent follower. And Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectenschlag. I don't know how I'm going to live here without you. Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there. Yes, I will take your coat and I will keep it with me. And I will sleep with it, because it smells like you. No, no, no, no, just put it on my chair. - All right. - Bye. Bye. - Call me when you land. - I will. Safe travels. Goodbye. For a very, very long time. Hmm? Okay. It's only three weeks. All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's going to be there. That marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee. What else is there to do?
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project: Develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram. Head of Special Projects. Work starts at 9:00. Sabre HQ is 30 minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone 20 minutes to shower, plus 50 for Jim to style his hair, between her room and the lobby, We're already 20 minutes late. Wake up! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Ah! Why are you sleeping that way? Oh. I was reading the mattress tag, and I fell asleep. Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on fire! Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! Mmm! Good morning. Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now. Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. I am on the two kid sleep schedule, so I'm up and at 'em at 4:15, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-- He-e-ere's Dwi-- What the--? - Oh, man. - What do you think happened? Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. Oh, no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at the Alcohol Club. Oh. - Puppet. - Cool, for your kids? Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before. Attention, Dunder Mifflin Group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan. I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam, and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her. I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel. - What does he like? - Power. Okay, and this one is, "Huh, don't see too many museums around here." Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car. Hey, are you okay? I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly, the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming. Who says none of us are diarrheal? Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you. Very funny, Jim. Oh, no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" And then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper, or put a cricket in my cereal, or something? I'm gonna set your face on fire. That's a good one. Whoa, Stanley. Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub? Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod. Yes. Ah. You're a nice guy, Jim, but have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins. Loggins and Messina. Did I say "Messina?" Ahh! Sorry, I couldn't resist. It's so quiet. I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written, like, It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin I thought that would be cooler. I loved it. Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet. Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it. Can we see that? Did you really find it? Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. In the trash. Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail. Oh, great. We're screwed. There. Oh! There we go. Pam? Yeah? Can you get the phone? Well, I'm not the receptionist. Mm, well, you used to be. I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a lot of work to do. Phone's ringing. Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out. I know it's for me. Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone! Answer the phone. - Andy, pick up the phone! - Get the damn phone! You're the closest one to it. Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service? Man. - How was the drive? - Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast. Life is short. "Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse." That's one of my mottos. I would love to hear the other mottos. - Quick query, Halpert. - No way. - Still queer? - Packer. You can't put me down. Too strong. Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-- Psst. Say, "So who's leading this thing, anyway?" So who's leading this thing, anyway? Psst. Say, "I can't wait to meet him." I can't wait to meet him. Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader? I-- You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful, huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. I'm Nellie Bertram, president of Special Projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window, and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch, after you decided I wasn't "a good fit." - It was-- - Ah. Mm-mmm. It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive, I bought 13 pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her, and she grabbed me by the shoulders, and she said, "Yes!" So let's talk about this Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like? Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one. No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic. Well, that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter. Oh, no, it does. It does, it has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? - Just so you could laugh at it. - Yeah. Let me just get the projector working. You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote. You didn't poison me, it's just stress. Okay. What is the antidote? True love's kiss. Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon. I'll do it. I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. Ah. - I can do it. - Mmm! There we go. Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know. Hold on. What kind of poison did you use? Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding. Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? - There's no name listed. - Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance? Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot. I tell you what. Since I moved down to Florida, I've really gotten back into hunting big time. Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual. Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense. You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter. Did you say, "masturbator?" I'm a decent baiter. My cousin, Mose, that's a master baiter. Why are you sitting down like that? Why is everyone else standing up? Okay, team, let's get back to work! Break's over! Wow. Are you that bored? It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate. Is that another motto? It's whatever you want. Mmm. Or do you only drink with your kids? Ah, let's do it. Oh, that's healthy. I've spent so much of my life telling myself, "Please, don't end up like Stanley," and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes. We have the Sabre pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans, you guys, humans pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm? - Yup. - Yeah. Tallahassee, let's go. Jim, are you in? Oh, I don't know. Sounds like a hoot. I'm in. All right, what the heck? Let's do it. This is great. This is gonna be great. I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt. I'll be on top. It's the most important position. Dude, I think you have appendicitis. Ahh! - Dwight? - Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while? Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit! Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen. Stop moving! No one's moving. Ohh! Oh, oh! Arrest Jim. He poisoned me. Wha--no. No, it was not a poisoning. The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty. You need an operation. You have appendicitis. Oh! Who called it? Nothing but net. How long will he be gone? Two or three days. Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen. Drama queen, am I right? Philip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Shrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up. That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting? Whoa, are those mini pizzas? Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck. Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? Hey, guys, look at me, I'm huge. Hey, Darryl, good news, your fax went through. Oh, Fuck yeah. - Up high. - Yes, sir. Thanks. Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. I put out some new magazines. Check it out. A dwell. I'm acting like I like reception, and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but I mean, seriously, reception sucks. Oh, there's the phone. I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in. Well, we broke into groups, and the groups are giving presentations later. Who's doing the presentations? Packer's giving one. Jim will probably give ours, I guess. Damn it! Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like, if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dick, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-- Features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty. Yes, that is a very good point. Yeah, Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting. Dwight, are you all right? I'm great. How are you? Mmm. Uh. What's our presentation about? Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours. I got the surgery, what else is there to do? Do 100 jumping Jacks. No, I don't feel like it. You do 100 jumping Jacks. I don't feel like it, either. I want that vice presidency. You haven't done any of the research. "You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. - I'm going to do it. - Aw, let him do it. Stanley, are you listening to music? Yup. All right, who's ready for the next presentation? Ah, what is your topic? What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is. Retail consumer habits. Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast-forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super-smart. Super-smart. Okay. Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean? - I can field this one. - No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer, it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed, and how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just-- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna Take a brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God. Next slide. Mail call!  His name is Oscar, and he got some mail   and he better open it, or go to jail   'cause it's your taxes  his name is Kevin  and no mail for him  but he got a coupon for some frozen  Yogurt. Are those the lyrics? "Anderson's Three Pillars of Retail." Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions? What are the three pillars of retail? Convenience. Ingredients. Service. Burgers. Building loyalty. Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room, I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters. Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight. Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim. You are bleeding through your shirt. Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. Ah. Hey, having fun? Yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Well, I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here? I found my calling. Andy, when I was 12 years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her, but when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly, and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog. Guys, I don't like this analogy. Ohh! Fine. Did you see this? - It's nice. - I mean - How are you feeling? - Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle. Can I see the wound? - Oh, God. - Oh! That's disgusting! That's barely healed. You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass. A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet. - That's right. - That is amazing. - Todd, look at that. - Oh, yikes. - Incom-- - Ah! Not so fast. Would you come in early tomorrow, so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you have a lot to offer. It would be an honor, ma'am. I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now. I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix. Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew. Hi, Andrew. What happened to Erin? Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida - for a couple of weeks. - Oh, good for her. She's such a sweetheart. You tell her Donna Muraski misses her. I miss her too. Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of famous Amos Cookies. Yeah! Ah. Aloha, aloha, aloha. So I hear you're all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game? Well, back when I was - a regular Amos - What's under the cloth? We'll get to that. Can I guess. I bet you anything it's cookies. It's cookies. Let me Let me finish my speech first. Oh we get jest. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just don't be coy! Make with the cookies. Okay, yes. Famous. Hi. I'm sure you get ideas for your cookies all the time. - But - Is it oatmeal with no rasins? I'm sorry, I was wasting your time.
Hey, Angela. Do you wanna see a picture of Philip wearing those little booties you got us? So cute. Hey, you guys wanna see a picture of Gerald wearing ? He refused to go is all he wants to do. Oscar thinks having a dog is just like having a baby. News flash, if you didn't carry it around in your belly for nine months, it isn't your kid. Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course. That is where we disagree. Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet? No, three-month-old humans don't do that. My Philip is crawling. - Angela is such a liar. - It's maddening. Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long. All night long. Well, count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide. I mean, you'll never sleep again. No one said, "you must have two." Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam-Jim DNA. - Thank you, no. - No, thank you. Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has no idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat. Am I right? Unbelievable! Un-be-lie-va-ble. It is the end of the day. It is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it? - Pretty good. - That's great. Well, thank you. This is very helpful feedback. Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like, "oh, what's more important? "Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP? Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP." Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more. Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking and sorting, or-- Catching butterflies. That's a hobby unless it's for food. - Theater. - Waste of time. - Dragging. - That's just a verb. Dragging sticks. Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks-- All right, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just-- You three, no. Not good enough. English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. You're crap. You're wonderful. They're-- they're mean, but they're incisive. Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it "compulsory." I'll be there at 6:00. Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real "Talla-nasty" we've been hearing so much about. - "Talla-nasty," very clever. - Thank you. Wait, wait, you think she invented "Talla-nasty"? No, no, no, no Uh-uh. Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. I thought I was gonna be hanging out with Stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon. My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no? Okay, everybody. Put your pencils down. And Bring 'em back up because now the late-night work jam begins. Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard. - We are good to go! - Say what? We are good to go! - Say what? - We're good to go! - Stop it. Stop it. - Stop. - Say-- - Andy. Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip. Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but someone dropped the ball. Ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor. Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass. Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him. Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children. What? It's true. He-- He would-- He would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips. That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king, whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback. What happens if you're the hunchback? - Oh, you get kicked. - How many buttons do you have? - Can I see? - Sure. So I get to kick you now. No, they're not transferable just 'cause I handed 'em to you. Well, that's how I played it in college. - College rules. - Aah! And he lost at his own lame game. Ooh, double meaning. The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit. Thank you. I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please. And I will have a waffle with your mapliest syrup. Sorry, no waffles. Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it. A waffle? A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. - Is that crazy? - No. I'm moving down here, you know. Oh. No, I didn't know. I'm young, and I can. And if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young. You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle. Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some sort of last-ditch, nothing-to-lose, Kelly ka-who run at her? - Hey. - Hey. - Watson Carpet And Tile. - One order. Order reference number 00983-126. Eight cases, bright white inkjet. - Paid. - I'm dying! - Processed. - And delivered. Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sort of feel out what the situation calls for. - I will be right back. - I will be here. Hey, I see what you're doing. It's futile. The VP position is mine. Oh, please. You're through. She's going to give it to me, as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. Well, saddles Sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth. What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me. If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off. Who is ready for dinner? "Oh, I bet it's pizza or tacos or something stupid." No. I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves A Jamaican feast, man. - Ooh. - Ugh. If I wanted Jamaican food, I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there. Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her "boyf." - Hey. - How you doing, Val? - Hey, babe. - Hey, babe. Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff. Oh, no, I'm not actually Jamaican. - Terrific. - What's up, man? I'm Darryl. Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good? - Oh, yeah. - Must be doing real good since you're fucking my girlfriend. - Whoa. - Whoa. Dude, you didn't tell me you were fucking Val. High five. I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend. Brandon, what the hell are you talking about? Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up. Honey, I am not sleeping with-- Hey! Hey Let's get back to the food. Brandon tell us about these delicious-looking goops. Hope you all like goat. Goat. - Blow in my ear. - All right. Like I'm on the beach. Oh. Seagull. And-- and a wave crashing. A wave crashing. Oh, that is lovely. All right. That's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening. - Hey, how's it going? - Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's, like, Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out in here? UhYeah, I'm just watching basketball. - Okay, yeah. - Okay. Cool. Is this March Madness? I love March Madness. Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually. So-- - Lebron James. - Yes, nice. Good word association. Impressive. Oh, please, anyone can tie a knot. The real skill is in untying it. Mm - Thornwood Wholesalers. - One order. I read the text you sent to Val, man. That's messed up. - Is this spicy? - No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so-- I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something. At midnight? - Yeah. - It happens. Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery-- Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here. Thank you. I think we're gonna need to hear those texts. Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before? No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life. I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts. Yup. Coming. All right. My mini bar is oddly out of rum. - We have plenty. - Oh, hello. Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game. Got it. Good night. Careful, Jim. It gets easier and easier. - No, no, no, Stanley. - Mm-hmm. - Stanley. - Uh-huh. Stanley. All right, hey. You know what? Just bring back those bottles! Whoa. The lights are still on. Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off. I like how guys just know stuff all the time. Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me. Hello, waffle iron. Hello. What do we have here? Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl - Right. - A measuring cup Got that. Get down. It's the fuzz. Shh! Do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please. "I got too much ice cream. You want some?" - "Gettin' my fry on." - Boring. Uh, "the moon is huge tonight." Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry. - That's regular text talk. - You forgot one. "You're such a great friend." With the dots. "You're such a great friend," dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. - Oh, ooh. - Five dots, Darryl? Are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means "to be continued," four dots is a typo, but five dots means, "whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind." Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. - Oh - See? Yes. Thank you, sister. Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right? Yeah. Totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on Shutter Island over here. You look like Ed Harris. If they stretched him a little bit. You want to see a picture of me trapped under a tree? Ah Excuse me. What? Not now. I'm busy. I'm sorry. I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But never mind. Sorry to interrupt. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Bedbugs? Oh, no. Freak, I need a favor. Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis. I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does not sleep with Nellie. What's in it for GSL? You really want Packer as your boss? Got it. If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200-year-old mattresses. - Where did you see it? - In the bed. I haven't seen anything. We gotta find it before it eggs. - Argh! - Jeez! Describe it. Brown, shiny, painful bite. Could be a bat weevil. Describe its mood. Did it seem sleepy? Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation. Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured? So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this. - Pssh. That's a bedbug. - Yeah. - Everything's a joke. - I know. - Check your hair. - Ow. God, oh. So greasy. You should just shave all this. - Just check it. - You are clean. Okay One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide. I am gonna generate myself into a human trap. When I jump into the bed, you are gonna cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. All right. Yeah. Cover me! - Is this really necessary? - He knows what he's doing. Let the bedbugs bite! Ugh, God, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower. All right, then I will catch you later. - What do we do now? - We wait. Come to papa. Oh. Mm-hmm. I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again. Nope, I wasn't bitten. Okay, well, maybe it's not warm enough in here. Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect. - Come on. - If there were any in here, they would've embedded themselves in me. You know what? Maybe they just ate. No, you're good. Clean bill of health. Besides, I got to get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long. Okay, well, they're fine. They're adults. No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first. Is that really how you want to get this job? Such a chorus girl. Okay, Dwight Dwight Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Uh Is crazy gone? Oh. They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore. Oh. Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present. Hey. Yeah, dot by chocolate, one banana . Okay, cool. Thanks. - I know, I'm a pig, right? - Hmm? No. Wait, this is why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. - Seriously. - Okay, all right. I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-- I'm married. I'm very happily married. Oh, my God! What are you thinking? Um I mean-- I know that you're married. I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me? I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-- I'm-- I misread things. Okay. Let's just go back to watching. Can you without running to the other side of the room all night? Yes, I can. Uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just-- We'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower. I don't care. Okay. I am so cold. Hey, Darryl. You okay? She's got a boyfriend. Play it cool, man. She'll come around. No, you should go for it. I mean, nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there. Yeah, but My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool. My husband would tell you to go for it. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, this is fun. - Hey. - A lot of fun. - I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day. You should move down here with me. - Yeah? - We could be roommates. - Really? - We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-- - Yeah. - Maybe in six months-- Six months? Um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly. Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts. Okay. Seven, one, one, nine No, no, no. Not numbers, no. - No, okay. - No. Try again. Ugh, I'm still getting numbers. Seven, one, one-- Is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven, one, one? 'Cause please stop, okay? Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time. Wait, the numbers! Mm-hmm. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. There you go. I will see you in seven-- Seven minutes. Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. Win at all costs. Don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America. They were farmers. And before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past. It has been processed. It has been delivered. That's it. Last one. Whoo! Andy, this has been an amazing night. Epic. Cool-down fiesta begins right now. - I got decaf coffee. - No way. I got Romy And Michele's High School Reunion. Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again? - Sure. - Okay, thanks. Hey, just so you know, me and you-- I don't think that's ridiculous. Dot, dot, dot Dot, dot. All right. Now I think it's time for you to go. What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right? Cathy, go. - Where's the bug? - Awesome. Stand back! Aah! Stop it, oh, my God! That burns! What is that? It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off of the maid's cart. Oh, my God. Dwight, there! Oh, God, stop it! Stop it! - Oh, big one! - Big one! Really big one! - I can't breathe! - I think I saw it! Stop it! Nice job. I think you got 'em. You can't stay here. This place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy. Second best bananas foster I've ever had. Oh, yeah? What's the first best? Dwight? Hello? Dwight - Is that Nellie? - Don't let-- Shh. Are you in there? I can see the lights under your door. Hello? Look, the light went off. Just as I said the light went on. Hello? Dwight? Oh Dwight!
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. And I, Dwight Truth I'm in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine. Hey are you holding this chair? 'Cause I feel like - Yes. Yes. Yes. - I'm gonna fall off. I'm not wearing the right shoes for this. We went over this, okay? Your tiny fingers make the best knots. Hey, strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening. Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new pyramid. Psst. It's me, Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me. Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt-- No, lower than What's lower than dirt? Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core. - Yeah, thank you. - Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom. When I auditioned for the Spice Girls, I didn't even get a callback. I never stood a chance. Okay. Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey. Okay. Nellie, thank you. - Thank you so much. - Yep. Today is press day, and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing-- Bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross, bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love 'em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty, yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this? When people see this presentation, they're gonna in their pants. - Okay. - Come on, man. Seriously disgusting. Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers. Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea. Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the pyramid. - Uh - Uh That is excellent. I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player. Perfect casting, right? Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator. I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of ET, candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples. Speaking of pimples, let's release the bloggers! Morning, everyone. Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning? Don't care. Tell me later. Listen, it's important. You've gotta hear this. What do you got? - Oh, my God. - Do you have a black eye? Yes, I do, Phyllis. I woke up at 4:00 A.M. by accident, in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what. It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car. Andy, who punched you? Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office? Black eye, Meredith. Will someone please explain what's going on here? Since the interesting thing happened till now, so much time has passed, it's like my life is buffering. Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day, and there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on-- on motorcycles. And they just were hassling Pam - That's true. - They had, uh - Weapons. - Weapons. I just stepped in to talk some sense into them. But these were not the kind of people who use their words. Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like-- like, senseless crime. - Thank goodness he was there. - Good job, Andy. Yeah! I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done. Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. - There's plenty for everyone! - Quit it! There's plenty! Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir. - I was ahead of you! - Okay, okay, hey, hey! It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of pyramids. Come on. I was in line before you. So you're a blogger, right? Yeah. Blogger. God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I'm trying to be a good girl for once. Uh, yeah, I already bought my pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing Zoo-ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla Music Festival. So fun. How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now! - No! - Yes! No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam? Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street. And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area. Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood? Because I have neighborhood pride. - 1-8-5-0-5. - Guys, guys. That's so vague. You gotta do the zip plus 4. Dash 7-4-2-7! Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police. Exactly. We need to feel safe. Which is why Toby is teaching us self-defense. Me? Toby, will you teach us self-defense? Yeah. Um I can't believe you remembered I do self-defense. Um, I'll go put on my cup. Great. - Yes! - Okay. I wasn't sure which one of you was Chuck! Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl? Look at that guy. He's got his Sabre phone on, and he's not even using it. This is a perfect photo for my "Daily Fail" blog. Uh, I-I gotta go. Okay. Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad. Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really-- on the Internet, it's a really-- That's a really good, good thing. Are you trying to sabotage this entire event? I'm very sorry. We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmm? "Hello. Hi, sweetie. It's Jim. "I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, "which is why my voice is crystal clear "and my hand won't ever get tired because of the ergonomic shape." I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck? You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do. Point it towards the store, idiot! You know what I mean? One of these buttons is-- Damn it. Take over. Oh, hey, hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here! We are closed! Come on. Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So Strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it. Ow. That may have been my fault. What the hell, Toby? Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have time to think, okay? So just remember, I-a-a-t-g. "It's all about the groin." What if you're being attacked by a Smallish man who happens to not have a groin? I don't think that's very common. What if you're being attacked by a 4'11" man - who's penisless? - Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker? Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like a fifth-grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man. Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female. So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself? It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker. You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel Based from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu. Can I please leave? I have a rape flute. All right, well, let's try one simple technique together. Why doesn't everyone stand? Okay, so You're being attacked. You got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two. One, two. - One, two. - Take that, kid. Cathy, I would like to introduce you to fatty gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired Magazine. Patty Grossman. I'm a woman. But you still work for Wired, right? Yes. Good! Okay. Flirt away. Sabre. It's time to come home. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think It seemed like you were a little nervous. - Yeah, no , Sherlock! - Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it? I know, I know, champ, just calm down, because listen When you're out in front of all those people - Yeah, what? - You just need to realize so much rides on this. - You have no idea. - Dwight. I'm trying to make him feel important. God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say. Um Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. - Hee hee hee. - You're so ignorant, you barely know what you're talking about. That's so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple of books. What's a book? Oh, my God. You're so embarrassing. My mom would say the best stuff, though. You can You can do it, Ryan. And you know that I'm capable of this. - You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie. What did you think of the presentation? I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one-- Oh, "fix" means you hate it! I knew it! - I need something to drink! - Jim, get him a water. No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red-- Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red! Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink! Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you're alive. Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice? I think you guys might have the wrong office. That's him The guy I hit. - What? - You've gotta be kidding me. Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, - and now she kicks your ass? - No, Kevin-- What about the lady you hit with a pine cone? There. That chubby one. I just had a baby. - Yesterday? - Wow. Apologize. Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your "thin" girlfriend. How 'bout we wait till next year after you have your kid? You know what? Tiffy's going to college. Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day. God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. - Bye-bye. - Bye. So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar-- "How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls." There's no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me. No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere. Oh, my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop. Oh Have you seen Erin? I'm on break. Oh, God! No, hey, bloggers, where do you think you're going? No, no, no, you gotta stay for the big presentation. We got this young whiz kid-- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates. When's the presentation? It's moments away. Just stay here! Hey, Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew, Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife? Well, that doesn't make any sense to me. - How you doing? - Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry, I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is why Your little man is unraveling. Now, go and fix it. Sorry about kicking you out. It's just we don't want our brand associated with death. It's okay. I'll go to the Costco and search for handsome men. You're not married yet? Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away. My best friend was my boss Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we're not really friends. Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him! Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband. Well How long has he been in the bathroom? - About ten minutes. - Jeez! What's he doing in there? Oop, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it, - or are you gonna freak out? - Are there bloggers around? It's Ryan. "I'm sorry. I lied. "I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home." What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here? I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing - Compared to this guy! - Uh - What? - That's right. Will you just give us a second? You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good - half-ass cockeyed - Okay. - That's-- - Jim-- - I'm not doing the presentation. Look at me. Look at me! Look At This Face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you If you don't do this, I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim. Okay. I'll do it. Oh, my God. Okay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes. - A costume? - Of course there's a costume! Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minute changes to really energize a presentation. Huh? Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long? I've been in here for 20 seconds. Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? I'm not wearing eyeliner. You are wearing eyeliner, Jim. Time. Space. Gender. There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that-- The only thing that remain-- The only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time-- Love, values, and of course, the pyramids-- The strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. No, that-- It's true. This is the future, because this is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction, unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. Yep. When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney World. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. I just wanted To go home. This is what the pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a USB port. Wireless Will be available in 2013. You can play anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the pyramid, you have the connection to everything, in time and space. Oh! Psst! Oh. Sabre. It's time to come home. All right. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay? We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but little things can be dangerous. Whether it's a Gremlin or Chucky The Doll-- The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace or a tub of electricity. Okay, good point. Um Good point? What is a tub of electricity? - I don't-- I don't-- - With all due respect, we know what we're defending against. It's a 12-year-old female bully. - I was a 12-year-old bully. - Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby. Yeah. Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent-up aggression. - Thanks. - Good. Go. - I don't know if this is gonna help-- Let's go, Kelly. We should stay to maybe some more traditional models-- You think you're so pretty! Well, you're not gonna be so pretty come prom time! Okay, this is what's called pre-violent posturing. Take that! Not so pre-violent anymore! Okay, I'm at what's called "the decision point." - Hey, hey, hey, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly-- Ow! God! My good eye! Oh, boy! Oh, no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um something that Cece did on the playground earlier-- Yesterday. This morning. You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others Pam and Toby. I stepped in, and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, "where were you when the girls came?" Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. I just feel good! Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. We could have integrated more Chuck into the presentation. Dwight. You're the Vice President. Ha ha ha ha! Yeah! Okay! - Come on! - Aah! Right on! Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Boom!
Okay. Bye. Everyone stop what you're doing. I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us. What? He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre retail, and he's staying in Florida forever. So He's alive. Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful. Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead. How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke of good fortune and he is now in a better place. If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure? Uh You guys, we've gone over this. There is no treasure. When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. Don't touch my treasure. Okay? You understand? Obviously, he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure! Oh, God, I'm Wallace Shawn The Princess Bride! I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. That's not Dwight. No. I am dying to know what's in there. Yeah, I know, Oscar. We all are. But nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. Hi, hello. Now carefully open the box. It's a photo of all of us. Oh, that's so sweet. Well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's okay though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow! Well, Mr. Ball, it's been a pleasure. Now give my regards to hell! Dah! All right! Well swung, my VIP VP. I am loving the chemistry between you two. I am so happy. Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George. I bet. I'm excited. Trick! There's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo. Ahh! I just made you look like the Goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either. You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. Boing! Oh, that reminds me. Little something from all of us. Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Jim. That's so thoughtful. Fore! - Oh, yeah! - He doesn't even care. Don't even care! This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling. It's, um What's the word? It's not bittersweet. It's, uh Sweet. Yeah. Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year? Would if I could and I can, so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice. I'll put you down for shortbreads. Damn it! Knock, knock. Hey, it's Sasha's first year in the troupe, so I'm selling cookies for her. - Anyway, would you like some? - No! - No. - What? I've been selling here for five years. This is my spot. You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at Your church or barbershop? Or Chess club? You know what? It's your first time. Let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, creed. And I don't know, I'll just take, uh - Accounting. - That's it? Yeah, well, okay. Thanks, Darryl. Okay. Great. All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined, and then some. When I first started selling cookies, he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin. Hey, Lucy, I'm home! Bobaloo! - Oh, here, let me help. - I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred. Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place. And it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. I run errands, I do chores around the house, I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me. When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all. Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss Andy and tell him I'm staying in Florida. Oh, what kind of tea is this? Oh, I boiled some Gatorade. - Oh. - Ah! In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see? We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias. If I may Try holding the putter Here. With your wrists here, your thumbs here. - Oh. - That's right. Your little finger. Would you like to buy some cookies? - Cookies, eh? - Mm-hmm.  Oh, the springtime thinks   that it's the best   fall time thinks that it's the best   cold time has kind of a strut   and Valentine's thinks that it's the best   but gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth   nothing beats the cookie season   that's the truth  It's not a scratch and sniff, Kev. I know. But sometimes you still get a little something. Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin. You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. - See you next year, sport. - No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me? - I do. - See? That doesn't mean anything. Kevin, do you wanna buy cookies from me? Oh, I definitely do. Huh. Hit the road, Jack. No, you hit the road, Jack. Hey, guys, come on. Don't fight over me. Why don't we split the order? It's only fair. No, wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and sixty-nined. Ugh. Metaphorically sixty-nined. Ew! Perverts. No offense, Oscar. Hop in. We have places to be. No rest for the wicked. Ha ha. All right. So I guess this is it. Well, Jim, I just wanna say that we haven't always gotten along. And at times, I've even hated your guts. But Bye-bye. I win. - Good-bye, Dwight. Robert! Race you to the clubhouse. Gentlemen's bet. Whoo-hoo! Well, he's Florida's problem now. Oh, let Dwight have his fun. - Today will not be his day. - What's that? I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board. I thought you liked the store. The store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job! Cheers. Thank you. But there's a reason we sell our products online and over the phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wise to us. Wow, when you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible. I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame, though I did like Dwight. Robert! I'm gonna win! Ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it! Bravo, Dwight. Very good. Shame. The math is simple, folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, - will raise Sabre - To the power of two. How did that look? I'm not just saying this. That was the best thing I've ever seen. Told you. When you guys do that whole "power of two" shebang, how about I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say "power of three." Hmm, actually, you know what? Yeah! That actually works. You'd spin-off right, I'd spin off You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper. All right. There he is. What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you. Can I just talk to you for one quick second? What, your stylist ran out of messy spray? Um, actually it's for your own good. I think we should You wanna do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop till you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go to hell! Nice! Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willie? Silence. I'm just trying I know what you're trying to do. I don't want it. But your face does look like the guy from "Operation." It's the same guy. - That's the joke I made. - That's not - Different guy. - You know what? I just think you should know That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. Well, I tried. You saw it. So it's on the record. I have a plane to catch. Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy. Just open the program and type in his username. Can you just do it? Here, type in your password. Erin123. That's a terrible password. And you don't "make a video chat" You "video chat." All right! Hello! That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. Oh! I fixed it. Oh! Now mine's broken. Hang on. Oh, there we go. Aghh! He said "I did like Dwight"? He's gonna fire him. No, no, I think it was more like, you know, "I liked him, but I don't any more, 'cause he did a bad job. So I'm definitely gonna yell at him." Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this. I tried. He will not listen. Did you actually try your hardest? Yes. My pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in a while, all right? He's like Super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight or som - Stanley, back me up. - Don't talk to me. Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up. If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out, that's all you can do. Okay. All right. What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago. - Yeah. - That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model. Thank you. I'm not gonna comment on my personal life. Look, I need this. Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door to door. You think people are gonna buy cookies from my Chubby daughter? Baby, if you're watching this, you're not chubby. You're beautiful. Daddy's just gotta sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun. Oh, you know what you have to do to decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things. Or have them sing that song that the frog does in Looney Tunes. Make them kiss each other. Make them kiss me! Eww. Yes! This is too tan. This right here. - No! - This is a tan spot. I don't buy it. That is a freckle. That is not a tan. I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally puertoriquena when I see you. Well, Andy, I'm not coming back. - What? - I have a job here. I work for an old lady. Hello! Andy? Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.  Oh, baby, telephone   and tell me I'm your own  This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better. But Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided That you guys are gonna keep doing things for me. No, no, no. It's not worth it. - No. - No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year. Yeah, okay, so what You'll buy 40 boxes? Hungrier. Hungrier. You're not talking Triple digits. Oh, yeah, I'm talking triple digits. Again.  Hello, my baby, hello, my honey   hello, my ragtime gal  Showtime. - Dwight. - You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back. You're like an amish return-stick. Okay, great, listen to me. No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please? Yes, you may tell me one thing. Great! Wait, do you wanna borrow money? Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store. Jim, come on. Dwight, he's gonna kill the store. - Mm-hmm. - And then I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it. Wait, he's gonna kill the store, - and he's gonna fire me. - Yes. - That's two things. - Dwight, please. Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past, and they're not gonna work today. Okay, first of all, they've mostly worked. You know what, you might wanna get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. - Bye! - Dwight, come Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man Unstoppability. Dunder Mifflin the farm, Mose. All those things. Vanish in my rearview mirror. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a Oh! Help! - Help! - Shut up. Oh, gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva? All I had to do was think about pie, and my salivary glands did the rest. - Nah! - What, what, what, what? - Oh, my appendix. - I'm sorry. - My wound hasn't healed yet. - I'm sorry. - Oh, man. - I'm so sorry, I forgot. Are you all right? Are you okay? Dwight! Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him. I don't know. He's not picking up. Oh, look like shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't Vice President material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I've got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man. Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the Vice President of Sabre retail Mr. Todd Packer. 'Sup? What are you doing? Oh, I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back and she didn't bother to tell anyone. We knew. Ryan told us. Ryan, why didn't you tell me? Thought you checked my Tumblr. You never update it. Well, I updated it. Does anyone else think this is weird? And, like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist? We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. Hup, hup, hup! What are you doing? - I was trying to go - Get up, get up. Okay, okay! All right? I'm not gonna let you by. Then you know what? I'm gonna just have to run right through you. Okay. What are you doing? Are you really revving up? You know that doesn't work. Jackie chan! Go. Hi, this is Alex. And this is Sam. Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy With us. Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day. I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens. Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names. Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony? Don't make me be your pony, Kevin. - Forget it, man. - What do you mean? I'm out. So is Toby. This may be wrong, but there's a limit to what I would do for my child. Yeah, I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey. No, guys! Stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything!  Hello, my baby, hello, my honey  I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. That's what That is Hmm. That's so good. What are you doing? No! - No, no, no! - This will end now. - No! This is dangerous. - Thunderslam! - Arrgh! - Oh! Anything else you need to talk about? Nope. That was it. Once again, it's showtime. What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution. If I may speak to that, I have only been Vice President of this project for the last half hour. So the man you want is Dwight Schrute. I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible. Whatever you do Do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents. The society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes. But not the man. You may not cancel his soul. That was never on the table. Are you kidding? She's the queen of the whole friggin' magilla! And yet, Todd, it's you who's fired. What I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? Hey, hey! They're back. Hey! Wait, Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida. Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um Wow, you look great. - Did you lose some weight? - Thank you. For someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight, but I started using my make up to contour my face to look skinnier. Actually put on five pounds. - Hey, good to have you back. - Good to be back. - Hey, stranger! - Hey! - Oh, I missed you. - I missed you. I'm going to Florida to get Erin. I forgot to check my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving I thought You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue? Yes. I am sure. Ahh! Slow computer!
This is Pam. Oh, my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling. Nice. There's this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it's not it doesn't sound cool. You just have to see it. Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal. Wow. It's the end of an era. Did a good job, buddy. Now it's time to come home. I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy. When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel. How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin? I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, "Look, a balloon." My Warcraft clan was still on speaking terms. My kid didn't have a face tattoo. I was still thinking of going back to school. And I was still just a paper salesman. Well, this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. - Who wants it? - Ooh. - Right here, right here. - Yes. Allow me to solve your problem then. - Nellie. - Mmm. Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie? What a nobody. Oh, look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here. What? How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation. Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony. - Mm. - What? I-I said, I'm Tony. Okay, I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But, uh, I'm Toby. You messed up saying your name? It happens, okay? So let's just find an empty desk for you, and I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in. - That one looks empty. - No, it's Andy's office. Oh, is it? I have one simple philosophy in business: If the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded. Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo. Good morning, Erin. How are you? How's your family doing? Bye. Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right, I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too, because he ran out of money. Listen to me, bragging away. - Nellie. - Robert. How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far? - So far, so good. - Good. Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous. Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it? Mmhm. Now let's find you something fun to do here, shall we? Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove. We have a manager. Do you really? Because it is 10:00, I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap. Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning? Huh, yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right, guys? Hello? Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work? Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come into work today, but I'm super sick. I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately. Okay, I'll try to come in, even though I'm really sick with the Florida flu. He just hung up on me mid-sentence. I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map, right? Oh, no. Thanks a lot, B.P. Not much we can do about this until he gets here. Can't you do something about this? Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim. Right. What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on? - Erin, you got a package. - I'm in the bathroom. Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label. - Did you wash your hands? - Yes.  Here I am  signed, sealed, delivered   I'm yours Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you. Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton, because I love you and I want to be with you. Where's the ring? - Hm? - Where's the ring, Lancelot? Would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn. Um, Andy I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you. Why won't she go with him? I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome. Hey Don't listen. So, what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? I know. It's a lot. So who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it Chumbo? I think it's a cross between "Dumbo" and "Jumbo," with a hint of "chubby." It's not a name. So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. But why, m'lady? Because I am your new manager. Robert, is Nellie our new manager? This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out. We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch, Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman? I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way. Hot tub party? Performance reviews. How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us? On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me. Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today. Oh, thanks. I've been reusing the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better. So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend? Well, we're not really dating anymore, so Basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few "T"s and dot a few "I" s, you know. So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend. I think you should leave, young man. All right, technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car, and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you. You didn't even stop to pee? Gross. - Any luck? - No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.  Please leave  a message for Andy Bernard   Include your na Oh, you're doing so good. Oh, my God, you're Superman over there. You should take it. It's probably your girlfriend, wondering where you are. Nope, it's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this in my quads. I can tell I'm getting stronger. You really wouldn't feel those kinds of results - after one session. - I don't know. Just let it vibrate. It's fine. - You could put it on silent. - I don't think it does that. Just go to preferences, then click Proctology. Andy? - Jim? - Andy, where are you? I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the I got the serious poops, man. He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down. What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job. What do you mean, take my job? Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager. Okay Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later. Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager. Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work? I like working here. Dwight, should she be our manager? I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm. Those who can't farm farm celery. And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? All right, let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis. Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know. Oh, oh, okay, I understand. Let me show you how these are going to go. Dwight. I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever. Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. - You're getting a raise. - What? Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that, do you not think you deserve a raise? There's no limit to what I think I deserve. - Then you accept it? - 5%, no less. Absolutely not. I know my worth. Raise isn't real. Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard. So, Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it. - Phyllis. - Pam. So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you. Really? Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there All very impressive. Um Are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises? I am not. Huh. Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis. Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown? Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a Well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not sorry. Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet, he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss. - Yes. - Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor? Oh, God, nature, please. When two animals are having sex, one of them Is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua this isn't very helpful. You're going to want to hear the sexual metaphor. Was that not the All life is sex. And all sex is competition. Mmhm. And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it? Was that it? No, that wasn't bad. My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is? No. I would've said no. Let's see. Review. Review. Review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise. Oh, great. I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that. No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. Sorry, too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off. Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Well fought. I accept the outcome. Touch me and I'll sue. I've heard that's amazing when it works. - Yeah, if I had my own - Andy, I care about you and - Sorry, you go. - No, go ahead. Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each ether's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say? Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else? You broke my heart too. You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think, at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be. I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other - at the same time. - I know. So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want. Really? Okay, well, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy. That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two. Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim? Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for What is it? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night? Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle. You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap? No. Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breath underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money. I think you're a witch. I think you're amazing. You know that, right? "I'm amazing." I'm amazing. Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy. Really? 'Cause you've been kind of a "B" to him all afternoon. I was protecting you, because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you in this economy with Europe on the brink Irene, what would you do without me? We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue home depot. Why? He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture. Jim, time for your review. No, it's not, because you don't really work here. Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise? Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises. Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell? - Yes. - I'm Tinkerbell. - No. - Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises. And we are grateful. But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist. - She dies. - She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell? Let's see it. Show of hands. - I do. - Oh! Come on, everyone. All right, guys, stop. - I already spent the money. - How? Come on, Jim, you're killing her. We believe! We believe! Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe. That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it. Andy, wait! Andy! Andy, wait. Andy, don't go. Andy, I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. - Erin! - I'm sorry. Andy. Let's get out of here. - Okay. - Let's go. Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff. No, I don't have any stuff. Like, your toothbrush and stuff. - I don't have one. - You don't have a toothbrush? No. How do you not have a toothbrush? I just there's always one around. You just use whichever one's sitting there? I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush? Of course. I own my toothbrush. I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard And most of my ideas are either on unoriginal or total crap. And yet I worked right into a job for which I was ill prepared, ill seated, and somebody else already had and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there, anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. - Can you sign his card? - Oh, great. "Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy." Oh, that's not good. Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious. It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache. Stanley doesn't have a moustache. Yeah, he does. Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke I'm-- not sure I think he has one, now that-- I think he has a moustache. Okay. Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not? Ooh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't. Phyllis, what are you talking-- The whole card depends on this! Okay. The man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face? 'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business. Okay. Which one of these looks more right? Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left. Guys, that's the elevator. - What if it's him? - Okay, quick. Who says moustache? Yep. Who says no moustache? Ah! Ha ha ha! - Oh, man! - Hey! - He does have one. - Yes! Welcome back, Stanley. "Good morning, Robert," says no one, Oh! Is this a video conference you're having with "Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz"? Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day. People, you should come to work already warm. is the most productive potential that a human being-- Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you are all here, so no harm done at all by my lateness. Nellie, really, 9:50? Oh, here's what happened. my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze. - Ah. - Nine minutes. Bzzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzzz-- Whack. Bzzz-- Whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes to go. No willpower. That is my curse! I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman. Ah ha! I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason. Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it. No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life. Well, yes, uh There is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. from England, and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move into my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense, but are there a lot of Irish people living around here? - Yes. - Yes. Ugh! I hate that! No offense. - None taken. - Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive. Oh! Ay, caramba! The natives are getting restless! - Who's a native? - Uh, excuse me. The tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. - Oh - Okay. Okay. If you'd let me finish-- or the squash court, or the supreme court. - Hmm? - Nellie. Yes, Robert! You're clearly under a lot of Stress with the moving and the work situation - you've found yourself in. - Yes. Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim, Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place. Why Jim? The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community. I'm sorry. We're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible? I'm sorry. We're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment. I'm still not sure why this woman is even here. Why is she here?  Two crazy kids on the journey of life   Going to Pennsylvania  On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in Southern Pennsylvania. Oh. That must be nice. Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy. Oh, no, no, I mean that must be nice to have parents. Oh. Hmm.  Time to have a little kiss  - No. - Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official. - Yes. - I believe in that. - Yes. So do I. - I think that's important. That is important. Bummer But important. - Important. - Mm-hmm. I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her. - I know, right? - She's always late. She's always rude. It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party. - Yeah. - On purpose. Phyllis! We should do it right here in the break room. Order carrot cake. And Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you. Well, Andy, I'm upset, but You did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover And I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay. That was one minute and ten seconds. Consider it nailed. I think we should try it again. This time, worst-case scenario. Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-- - What? I just need you to know-- What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. Ugh! Ow. Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door. Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is." - The one time-- - I will get the chair in. Watch the great Schrutini work his magic. Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic. Excuse me, one second. - Hi. - Hey, what's up? Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight. Haulin' cube! That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler. So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad. Sounds like every other party. No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card. Oh! Hire a magician. - What? - Trust me. Okay. Oh. Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird. Andy! Hey, what are you doing here? Hey, Lauren. Look at you. Well, I know. Look at me. I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica. Aww! Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car. Oh. God. So I'm Erin. Hi. - Yep. This is Erin. - Nice to meet you. Well, Jess went out for a run, but she'll be back soon. - Mm-hmm. - Hey, ladies. Andy's here. Okay, Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends, an they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go? You know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-- Oh, Jess! Look who stopped by after his business trip. Andy! Hey! I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a tweeter account. Yes, you should. Ooh! "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie." - I have to see these shoes. - I doubt that they're sh-- Whoa. Who's this guy? Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend. Boyfriend. Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend. Like a boyfriend? - You read my mind. - Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out. Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory-- He's a hated Italian politician. Better theory-- This is her ex-boyfriend, and they went through some kind of painful breakup. - Oh, Nellie. - Oh. I'm so sorry. We were just I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry. - Why not call - Shh! God. We owned a flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant. That's awful. What kind of restaurant? Dwight. I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one? I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories. If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candle stick. Thank you. No. Jim, Dwight, please Don't tell anyone about this. No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this, um, Halloween or No. That's the most embarrassing thing of all of this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by a bloody stage magician? Hey, you know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff. What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea-- Everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you. - No, that's not what I-- - Jim, could you give us a hand? Absolutely. Yeah. Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me. Oh. O-okay. Okay, I will. - Pam, we have a great idea. - Listen to this. We're gonna have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick. - Or what if - Okay. We discuss The idea of doing the party totally normal? Like Not mean. Just a regular party. Not mean. I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know. We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point. What are you talking about? Of course we can. What I mean to say is we don't want to. Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks. Suck it! - Andy-- - It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis? No, I'll just have some gummy bears. - These are delicious. - But they're penises. And we come to Matthew, the guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. - Oh! - Eew! Eew! Aw! That seems gross At first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. I don't know. I just-- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one. - No, pop Matthew. - Pop it! Pop it! - Hey. - Hey. Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse. - Aah! - Oh! Ha ha ha! Megan! You are one of the good ones, nard dog. - Aw - No, really. Where's my Andy? - I dunno. - Oh, he's out there. Are you gonna sing for us? Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!  Beyond Bonnie Banks   And beyond Bonnie Brae's  Okay, they're almost here. What? Come on! If you guys are gonna be mean, can you at least be subtle? Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag. Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult. Plus, everyone would know who you meant. - Yeah. - No. That's a great idea. Yes, let's have a code name. How 'bout mondays? I hate mondays? Mondays are the worst? Nobody's named Monday. Hey, how 'bout we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember. 'Cause there's someone already here named Pam. Hey! Welcome to your party. Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, "Have you heard my originals? They're terrible." They said, "Even better." I said, "I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie." Maybe we should just go. No. I gotta do this. Hey, Jessica, can I talk to you? Uh, yeah, sure. What's up? Maybe we could talk in private. Uh yeah. What is it? Well, first let me just say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends. You're breaking up with me? Uh No. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now. Oh, my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material, and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it? Whoa! That-- No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay. What? I am gay, and I prefer men. - I knew it! - You did not, Kenny! You invited me to go shopping with you. I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay. Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were together. And you seemed pretty excitable. Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos. I can't say it doesn't make sense - Well - Look, it's-- I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-- It's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just I'm just upset for now. Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. So we should probably go. This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent. To Nellie Bertram. You are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company. - Cheers. - Why, thank you. Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company. Cheers. Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit Enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up, and probably makes her such a torture to work with. We hate Pam. We hate Pam. We hate Pam! We hate Pam! - We hate pa-- - So we've established - No. No. - That you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just Disappear? Oh! That was a really rough scene. - Right? Rough scene. - Yeah. Oh At least we can kiss now. Oh, yeah. You know, that stuff that I said about you to her I did-- That's just-- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time. Yeah. Yes, of course. - Ah I feel really tired. - Yeah. Probably from seeing that turkey. - Oh, yeah. - When we drove by the farm. Ohh. Always does it. Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh? Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer. - No, Nell-- She-- - I'll do it. Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for birds. All right, let's, uh-- Let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is. It's the 4 of hearts. Oh, no, you-- Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo El cardo, seÃ±or? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now, sir, will you please shuffle the deck? You didn't just do that on Purpose, did ya? Why is Jim treating the magician poorly? Little known fact about me-- Before I was a magician, I used to work - at a rope factory. - Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place. But I never could seem to figure out those knots. That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears. What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look! This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-- - Okay, scram, wizard. - What? - You heard me! - Ho oh! Well, Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-- Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees in their own way. Don't you see what I see? Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party. You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth? What? Why are we-- - I just gotta do one thing. Oh. Hello. Hey, everybody, look who's here. What are you doing here? Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay that I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon, and she's right there. She's sweet, funny, and beautiful, and total relationship material. Why the hell did you come back here? - Go away. - Get lost. - Get out! - Okay. - You're done! - Bye, guys. Get out. You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? Yeah, run away, Andy. - Run away! - You're disgusting! I can't believe you're not gay! - Yeah, get outta here. - Don't come back. Uh-oh. - You don't even know how to drive! - Bye, Andy! - Loser! - Nice car! Have fun! - Hey, Hank. - Yes, ma'am. I thought I was very specific about not letting up a magician? Yes, ma'am. I got my eyes open. Oh, turns out that he actually made it up there. What? That ain't right. Yeah, he came and went. Wait a minute! You said he was a magician, right? You don't think he could have used It couldn't have been Just let's go Night, night.
Woo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moly. Phyllis says the same So I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates. So how's the drive in? Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain. You don't say? Yeah, you know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour? Oh, the plants are gonna love this. I actually sleep better when it's raining. Tell me about it. Time's almost up. How many are left? Just one. "This weather makes me to stay at home, curled up with a good book." Phyllis. This rain Does it make you wanna be doing something? What do you mean? You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain? Hey, come on. Lots of things are cozy in the rain. And that's noon. Exactly. I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here.  My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble   Hey la, hey la  -  My girlfriend's back  -  His girlfriend's back  Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi. - Welcome home. - Thank you. - Hey, Kev! - Yeah. - Nice sweater. - Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. Nellie let me bobblize him. His name is now Captain Mutato. I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man, and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter. Okie doke. Yes? Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about. Oh, yes. I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence. You are most welcome. Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back whenever you get a chance. No. Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all of this stuff out of here. But You know, the sooner the better. - Mm-hmm. - Get back to normalcy. Hmm, no. And then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call. Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much. But seriously, we don't wanna bother you - any more than we already have. - That's it. It's no bother. You guys are our friends. Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls. And I said I know the perfect girl. Yep. Because Kelly is Indian, and Oh, that's it. Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together. Why! Kelly has been a handful in the past. But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. And I just had to get her clean. Get lower. Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby. Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do not shake the baby. Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you gotta-- You can't do that. - Don't shake our baby? - Yeah. Okay. I'd never heard that before. - So, thank you. - Oh, my God. Yeah, I'm glad you said something. Me too. Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome If you're into Indian people. I'm not. Hey, um What's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh? Yeah, they're really great together. Maybe we weren't right together, but it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love? That's about it, yeah. Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager, so if you would just give him his office-- - No. I'm sorry. This is what I was trying to tell you. I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. Oh, Bobby, get accustomed to it, because then it feels good when they finally say yes. You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves. I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to recuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love, and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way. I'm gonna count down from five, and if are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay $100. Okay. Five four You can't dock my pay. Angela! Dock Andy's pay $100! On it! Great! Um, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Angela Please dock Nellie's pay $100. Angela? - Do you want to go again? - Angela? Let's go again. Ooh, she's counting again. - 3 2 1. - Oh, oh! Angela, $200! You got it. Seriously, Angela? I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago. When I see him start to get mad, I just Put my hand on his arm like this. I know what, let's go $10,000. You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless. - 3 - It's literally like One. There you go. Hey, we're gonna have a nice, hot date. Hey. So last night was so not a big deal. Oh, yeah, I was just tired. - We both were. - Yeah. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self. Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night. It's not a big deal. Yeah. I know it's not a big deal. I found this the other day while I was journaling, and they reminded me of you. Oh, those are from our weekend at the Timeshare. Yeah, the fractional ownership property. Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight. I don't even remember what that fight was about. You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But-- All I remember is how pretty you looked taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you wanna order prints of your own, I can send you the link. I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change. When you lost the manager job Yes? Did it affect you outside of the office? How? I don't know what the technical term is. Hmm. Penial softiosis. Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never. - Oh okay. - Okay? Okay. - Washington Monument. - Okay. - Eiffel Tower. - Okay, okay. Hmm. I saw you were getting along with Ryan again. He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, "Kelly, that will be the color of our children." Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though? Which time? I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I-- I feel like that question was coming. One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend. And Meredith said she was interested, and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that. Every day, I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on. Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that. What do you mean? Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant. I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood. Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room. You can't call a meeting. But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting. Okay, if you would like to take a seat, - we can get started. - Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. - So. - No. Wanted to talk to all of you guys about importance and know that each and every one of you is vitally important. Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is impotence. Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy. "Take a man's job, but leave him his balls." Margaret Thatcher said that probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie. This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem. It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male. Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular? Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men. - How old? - How old? Jinx. Buy me some coke. Dwight told me about it earlier. Dwight! You promised. Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie? No, no, no, no. It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. - What are you doing? - What is this? - Stop that! - Dwight! Dwight, stop that. Stop it. Fine, it was me. I couldn't-- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy? I had a lot on my mind last night and I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview. Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna. T-dog! Um Um I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You-- You're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what. It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. - Fascinating. - Fascinating. I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton. Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with little Chumbo? Tip-top shape. Oh Stanley. No. Mm-mm. Creed, you are 1,000 years old. Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did. Okay, so I-I-I-- Actually, Andy, I think maybe we experienced it. What happened? - That a couple of times-- - Couple of times. Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times. - Yeah, Jim. - Get it out there. Um I don't-- Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted. I could barely see. - Okay, stop. - I was very drunk. If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was 42. And then when I did, it lasted till I was 44. I got nothing done. I've read-- And I don't know anything about this personally-- But they say prostate stimulation can help. Ugh. This is just-- This American Life I think I heard it on. No, that's absolutely the case. I know, right? You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only, but I could let you rent it. Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? Wow, what are we talking about? Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff? Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything. The most important thing to remember is do not stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral. I almost didn't come in today. Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet. Erin, on phone memos, you're righting the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional. Shut up! Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here. Take 'em yourself! Oh, and another thing. Our sex life is none of your businesses! And Andy is the manager, not Nellie! Stop protecting me. I'm a man-- I can protect myself. This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry. I don't mean to lash out at you. There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! Dad, go to hell! I'm taller than you! Okay, just calm down. You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit. Andy, why don't you just take a seat? Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels? - And your stupid face! - Oh. And your stupid office! - Ah! - Ow. He does not like that wall. Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together. That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys. Andy, Erin, you can join us now. Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly. All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly. Well, that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face. Fair enough. Um I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before. I don't like you very much. Well, a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is. Oh, come on, Ryan. Really? - Ravi's way better. - For Kelly? Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package. I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say just having knowing you short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy. Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it. - Oh, come. - Oh, no, no, no. Read it, please. I love amazing poetry. No, it would cause me too much pain. Read through the pain. Be strong. This poem would crush you! Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend! Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous. - Please leave her alone. - You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world. Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me. Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kinda funny. No. Excuse me? I'm saying no. - Well, you can't say no. - No. Oh, boo! Boo! Pam. - Boo to you! Boo! - You are toxic. You are toxic! Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, - and please don't interrupt. - I wasn't going to interrupt. Well, you do a lot, so just don't-- Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I wanna marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But someday. And probably. Barf! Ugh, you suck! What is your problem? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Can we turn this back around quickly, please? Can we turn this around quickly? - This is very important to me. - Betsy, turn around. Turn around. Turn around! Help me turn this fucking thing around, please. - Thank you. - She don't wanna turn around. Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are 50/50 that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly. Ryan. Will you roll those dice with me? You mean so much to me. But I love Ravi and I choose him. - No, you don't. - I do. No, you don't. I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug? What? This was really cool. Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing. Oh, God. Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job. No. It's the apology. I really have to insist. - No. - Stop saying no. No. Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So is there anything else you wanna say? No. I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. - I feel alive. - Here. A-da, da, da, da. I got it. - But you hurt your hand. - I got it. - Right now? - Yes. You're not a least a bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul? Not at all. Can we go? Kapoor and Kadesperate. He watches - Second line. - He is a drifter out to see It went the Indian Ocean in calms, one speck of white remains and waters called and Kelly grinned. It's just so dumb but when he describes himself as a child, lost and Ryan can never know.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no - No! - Okay, fine. Ryan. Is something the matter? Smokey's dead. Smokey the bear? Smokey Robinson, Pam. He died, like, an hour ago. I guess I'm the first to know. Wow, that's terrible. I really liked him. Oh, you liked him? That's nice. Did you "like" when he changed the course of American music like, two or three times? Did you "like" that Tracks Of My Tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you like him, Jim. I am completely devastated right now. Well, I second that emotion. - Huh? - I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones? Oh, God, Nellie, what wasn't his? I mean, um, Tracks Of My Tears - Yeah. - Um, God, so many. No, no, no. Tracks Of My Tears and what else? What are some more? What's one more? Okay, I'm not-- I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today. I don't think you love Smokey Robinson, I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music. Okay, I'm sorry that I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or The Beatles. You don't like The Beatles? That's-- That's not the point. Eleanor Rigby? Paperback Writer? Well, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing? It says here the "Smokey Robinson dead" thing is a hoax. Wow, look at that. Says he's actually playing State College. It's only three hours away. Oh, my God, Ryan, that's perfect! You have to go. Tickets are 250 bucks. $250 is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan. Yeah. Who's opening? - Paul Anka. - Paul Anka? How can they make the smoke man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this. Okay, you could just show up late, though. How much is parking? Like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would've wanted-- Does want. Tears of a clown. Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that. Looking good, RC. Ugh, I hate ties. I feel like I'm being strangled, like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club, over on I-84-- The red room, say? Or Dominic's? Robert, the Senator was gonna wear dark brown tonight. I'm sure it'll be fine. My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters. Robert California bought two tables for everyone here. These people were lucky to get seats, because it is gonna be a who's who of the northern 22nd district. I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we're all about to be killed. Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people. - What's going on? - There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot. Oh, that's Andy. He's just hanging out. Yeah, that's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle-aged white male "hanging out." Call the cops. Dwight, I don't think he's gonna hurt anybody. How do you know? I mean, why do you think he's there? I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun, could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof, and I'm gonna Bring my gym bag, just in case. I knew this would happen. Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered. - Hey. - Hey. Just wanted to say hi, and hear you say, "everything's normal." Maybe videotape you saying that, so that everyone upstairs can see. We think you might kill Robert. What? Because he fired you, which means apparently you're living in your car now. Guys, everything is fine. I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the fundraiser. - Oh, great. - Oh, great, that sounds good. Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's gonna be weird. Why would that be weird? It's gonna be super-weird. He just fired you last week. Andy's just coming as my date. Hey, I hear you. I hope you're right. It just seems like it's gonna be really - Really weird. - Okay. Come in. You really redid Andy's office, huh? Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal. Need you to sign these. We got a shipment going out. How are things in the warehouse? You could go downstairs and ask 'em. The warehouse isn't downstairs. Is it? Is it. Who knew, right? Ah. Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me. Robert, the Senator and I wanted to stop by. - Hey, Robert. - Robert, how are you? - Say hello. - Hello. Did anyone order a blast from the past with a side order of sexy? - Hi, Andy. - Oh, man, this is weird. - Andrew. - Oh, uh, want to shake my hand, huh? 'Cause I want to shake your body! I had you. I had you! Wh-- Wha-- Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things. Okay, all right, how-- Uh, what's the question? How am I doing? Um, great. Creed, I just bid $20 on six jiujitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy. Oh, I don't want to get raped. No, it was my idea to not be raped. - Well, well - What, you think jiujitsu classes cost $22? If you're gonna play "guess the price," you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180. Oh. Dwight, I don't think you understand-- You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a quaker fair before? Gah. So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? 'Cause up till now, we didn't have one. What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today, I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, although it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it. Wow. Yeah, that's exciting. But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us. The hero lives in this dystopian future, and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a-- a treble clef, and he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil. Sounds like you're doing all right. Uh, a little better than all right, actually. Really good. Oh, this guy's having a breakdown. You know, Oscar, I really had no idea that you were so passionate about animals. My dog Gerald is my life. Really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up at night, say, um, after 9:00. Excuse me. This confirms three things, I'm right about the Senator, I still got it, and poor Angela. Step in right away, and start-- Bobby? Bob-o? You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas. - Well-- - You got to check out this thing I'm working on. It's really cool. There's this character, Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world, because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control. Huh, so Thomas Oregon is an evil figure? Evil. Although he's humanized at the end, because he weeps uncontrollably and pees in his pants. And the hero, who is that based on? Me, I guess.  We're flying so high we're cracking the sky   Gonna fly out of this storm, my girlfriend and I  Hey, jabroni, show come class. She's right, Andy, you're being a jabroni. You're being a Thomas Oregon. Uh, Andrew I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great, romantic dinner tonight? Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow? Andy, you should leave. Now. Excuse me, I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please. Oh, I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units. Then I'll take a table. Okay. And a high five. Let's do that again. Oh yes, indeed. When. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Forgot a few salads. When. I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angela's husband just hit on me. - Oh, my God. - I know! Wait, what? Come on. We were talking about animals. He gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it. Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoozing a voter? Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to rock more than just my vote. Okay. What was this look? Whoa. - What happened? Did he do it? - Are you--? - I-- - Twice. For real? Okay, guys, not every glance means something, all right? - Life isn't Downton Abbey. - Life is Downton Abbey. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna talk to him, and I guarantee you, he gives out his cell phone to everybody. How much do you guys charge for a one full-year gym membership? Thank you. It's $475. Like candy from a baby. Hey. - David Wallace? - Andy Bernard? - Hey, how are you? - How you doin'? I'm great. How you doin'? Are you still with Dunder Mifflin? No, got canned last week. Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. No, best thing that ever happened to me. That's the attitude to have. You know what? When I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck It. - Yikes. - Yeah, exactly, right? Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for $20 million. Point is, forget those guys. Okay? Move on. Good to see you, Andy. Call me a layman, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like, um, hamburgers, or Um, Oreos, or a pizza pie, or, um What's another food that we like? Tacos. What I wouldn't give for a big - Mess of tacos right now. - Tacos. I can go get us some tacos. Brilliant. If you loan me some money. Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we probably need about, what twen-- $20, or $25? 20-- - 30. - $30, yes. - 30. - Yeah, um I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimey, and please, God, don't let them have eyes. Thank you very much. - So? - Boom. This is interesting. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - What is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody. Or, you proved that he thinks your gay. He doesn't think Jim is gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes. Well, a gay man wouldn't leave the store wearing those shoes. Oh. Hey, you bought me these shoes. Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy-- Robert California. Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason. Can you believe this guy? State Senator Robert Lipton loves dogs. He asked me if I love dogs. You know what I said? Yes. Not a joke. That w-- That was not even a joke. Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. When her owner passed away, she came to this organization for replacement but people don't often adopt older dogs. So Bella and 11 heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers, because frankly, nobody else will. I will. I will take all of those dogs. - Andy, that's very kind, but-- - No, no, no, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, - but it's not that complicated. - Andy, - why don't we discuss this-- - No, no, no, no. It's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello, everyone, I'm Andy Bernard, and I am going to take that bitch home. That is a female dog reference. "This bitch understands loyalty." Sassy human reference. Thank you. I will take Bella. - Take-- - Aw. And every single one of her friends. Oh, God. Mr. Bernard? Please, this way, okay? Hope you all learned something. Kenny's gonna need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's gonna puke it up, so other end's best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo, because Daisy'll start to, uh, I was gonna say "bark," but it's more of a scream. I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already. I know, Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks your in some kind of emotional crisis. Stupid dog. Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my door is always open, so here is my office number - and my cell number. - Thank you. Okay. Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. I'm sorry, Oscar. Oh, sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here. No, I'm certainly not disappointed that Angela's husband wasn't hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster. Tacos were on sale. Eight for $3. Oh, great. Okay. Oh. - Oh. Oh-- Oh, these tacos. Right. - Mm-hmm. Mmm. Uh, okay. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, huh. Mmm. She's trying. The winner of the three-day trip to the top of the Skytop Lodge is Dwight Shrute. Yes! Thank you. The year-long membership to Scranton Bikram Yoga is Dwight Shrute. Oh, yes! Yeah! A one-hour appointment with The Kissing Magician goes to Dwight Shrute. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, oh, yeah! Well, I think I can save us all some time. Uh, Dwight Shrute has won every single item here. Thank you very much! All I had to do was look up the prices, idiots! - Suck it! - Well, Dwight, yes, you certainly are a record-breaker. Your donation is the largest we've ever received, at over $34,000. Speech! Speech. No, speech. Speech. Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you What an honor it is to support this thing. And obviously, that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But I want to ask you something. When did it become all about the money? When did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritzers, hmm? And all the dinner rolls. You people should be ashamed of yourselves. How many courses did we have tonight? Two? Three, maybe, if you chose the pudding. I mean, what waste. These tables, tarted up like victorian whores. Let's remember we are all here For the The dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is, not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night. Whoa! Uh Oh. - Oscar. - Nice to see you again. - It was lovely. - It was lovely. And don't forget to call. Okay. Thanks so much for coming. Why does this always happen to me? Ah! I just feel so bad for Angela. So it just goes on under here, like this? That's right. - Oh, God! - Yeah. Yeah, - you never get used to that. - Wow. Hey, just wanted to check in, see how you're doing. I am so great. He's great. We're all great. This is my life now. I'm a dog nurse. Look at that one, though. He's smiling. Yeah, he should be. It's his first day without a muzzle. This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. - Absolutely, it's - Yes. - Awesome. - I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great. He was fired. This is terrible. This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best. You're right. He's right. I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe-- Maybe you would think it too. I'm sorry, uh, I-- Uh, it's just, I-- I-- I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations, so-- - Okay, well, Andy, listen, it's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh. Yeah, I mean, admitting that you need help - is the first step. - Yes, and also, focusing on the positive. Like, I got a lot of good things going on. Yeah. Like that rock opera. You could always do that, right? Yeah, I do. I have that. Yeah. You're gonna be all right. Mmm, no. No, he's not. Yes I am. Thank you, Kev. You're welcome. Sometimes I feel like everyone I work with is an idiot. And by "sometimes," I mean "all times." All the time. Every of the time. So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great. Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs. Yeah, my dog Ruby doesn't do anything. She just lays there all day. She's so chill. What do you feed her? Well, I put out Pro Bow Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty. Is she sick? How are her poops? Doesn't really poop. It's perfect. Nothing to pick up. She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to pop her eyes open, so she can see it. - Does she smell? - She smells horrible, it's unbelievable, but I don't want to put her in the bath, 'cause I'm afraid she'll drawn. People seem awfully interested in you, Ruby. I guess they're just jealous, right? Yeah, attagirl, attagirl. And that stinks.
Man, my delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop. For a 180 pound man with no fat. Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? There you go, boys. See how papa takes care of you? Mwah. I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They'd flex them all night at the discotheque. Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh? - Yeah. - Oh, please. Core's critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One-- Lengthen. Two-- Elongate. Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that-- Flat curl contest. All right, here we go, everybody. May the manliest man win. Go. Feast on this, Lewis. - Argh! - I love the burn. The burn is where I live. Come on, Gabe, you can't handle his hamstrings. You're getting hypno-thigh-zed. Speed set! One! Two! Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. Five, six Quick phone call from you guys. Keep going. Eight, nine, ten. We got it? Very funny, Jim. Everyone. Conference room, now. Oh. Ooh. All right, easy there, grandpa. - I don't need your help. - Okay. - You don't need my help? - Here, here Just Morning. Hey. Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot - These. - Oh. You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone. Andy, if you're gonna hang out for a while, uh What's this? This dumb rule Robert made. He just wants visitors to sign in. Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me? No, of course not. It's just-- I think it's, like, if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then it's, like, where does it end? So just Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? Is it because I'm not an employee anymore? Because that's what it feels like. All right, well, enjoy the alumni game. - Good, we have a deal? - Thanks, Janet. Thanks so much, Earl. Wow, simultaneous sale. And they said it couldn't be done. Boom! Lot going on, guys. What's happening? Binghamton branch closed last night, and all their clients are for grabs. That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo. Hey, hey, come on, language. Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes. - In the fridge. - No, Jim. The butt, in his butt. Sorry, man, I can't focus on zingers. There's too many potential clients. You two better watch yourselves. Yeah, the Syracuse branch can't be happy you're taking New York clients. Shh. Shh. Robert Why did Binghamton close? Can everyone just please I had a one-man saturnalia last night. In celebration of the finalization of my divorce, I got into a case of Australian reds and-- How should I say this-- Columbian whites. What-- what is this about, uh, Binghamton? The branch closed. Forever. Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But in vino veritas, as they say. I'm not gonna start doubting my drunken self now. I got your voicemail. From-- from last night. - Wonderful. - And the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes, and Never. Pam, when's the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn't hold the memories in? Oh, it was the summer-- Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said. - Um, I am a little busy. - Yes. 'Course. Why don't you list the things that would keep you from helping me. Yeah, I can make you a list. Let's do it now. What's number one? Why don't I help you now? - There we go. - Okay. Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute? Jim, Dwight, what are your last names? And you are? Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse. What the hell's all this? Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato. You live well down here in PA. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one's that guy? The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it. Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to-- How do I put this-- Steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud. Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money. - Yes. - Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesmen. There he is. That's Lloyd. Me? Yeah, you. Where do you get off crossing State lines? Now, we're actually closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe. I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn't back down from anybody. And he calls people "kimosabe." They're New York. We're New York. State line is the dividing line. That's the way it's always been. There's actually not a rule that says that. - That's true. - That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook, Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands? No. Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now. Stay out of my State. It's in your best interest to stay out of my State. I've seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast. Just stay out of New York, Lloyd. Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the CEO should decide this? Robert's here? Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don't think we were doing that. Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg. Where's the Advil, Jim? I think I've hit my limit - on the Tylenol-- Oh. - Sorry, not Jim. Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida? Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar - off the pan before it dries. - Oh, for God-- - Robert California. What a surprise you're here in Scranton. - Harry. - So Why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place? How do you mean? I forgot a-- - A pan, uh-- - No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead. Harry, there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems So poorly timed. Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say. Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. - Prestige Direct Mail Solutions-- - Don't listen to him. - Used to be Binghamton's-- - Nope. - I want it, it's mine. - Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert. We need you to make a decision. - Make a decision. - I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all. Shaping a company is in essence similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I'll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one. Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? I'm gonna get some air. Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first. He's running! Damn it! Damn it. Wha-- what is this supposed to be? It's a monkey. Jim, get real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose. Hold on, hold on. Is this him? - What? - Is that him? It's him! Do something! Get out! What? What am I gonna do? I don't-- Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five-second delay. - Dwight! - Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? - Hit the Nos. - Nos? You mean like in Fast And Furious? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, definitely have Nos. - Hit the Nos. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Brace yourself. - 3 2 1. - We got it. Go! Here we go! Hello. Andy Bernard to see the CEO. Oh, do you have an appointment? No, I do not. Okay, I think I can squeeze you in. Seriously? 'Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you. He's really not that busy. Is there someone here to see me? Yes, this man. Come on in. So What do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight? Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does. Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don't worry, I won't lay an egg. Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk. Did someone say girl talk? Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk. Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I'm pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella Girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines. Do you think I'd like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish? Uh, I think you're gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. It'll be upsetting if you don't. I'm a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs. Why haven't I heard of you? You got any references? No. I'm a rogue. - Uh-huh. - Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get Now I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime. Every salesman I've ever met has given me his personal phone number. Of course they have. Which is why I'm giving you a key to my house. Whatever you need-- Anytime, night or day-- You just stop on by. You want me to drive to your house if I need paper. Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe You need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat, pray, love. Easy to remember. Ready? Go, go! Go! Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Ahhh You all right? Yeah. - Oh. - Ah! Dwight, what are you doing? Go, go! Take the stairs! Now! - What are you talking about? - Just run! Take the stairs! I don't even know where the stairs are. - I'll stall him. Go! - God! What are you doing? I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. Oh. My pants fell down. What? My pants fell down! I don't have a belt! Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. - What's going on? - Mr. Ramish. Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse. Oh, oh. Okay. I already made an appointment with your secretary. Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier. Wait, it's not DM Utica, is it? No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. - It's Big Red Paper Company. - Big Red Paper Company? Mm-hmm. Yes, yes, yes! - Give me a cup of coffee. - Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst? All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us. So We're still on the same team. - Let me get these. - No. Let him get his own. He's got Syracuse money. You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating? Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years. But you're saying there's a chance. Shut up. - Hey. - Hmm? - I stole Nellie's phone. - Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery. What do you want from me? Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's "yes, yes, yes, yes. Never." Hello, Nell, it's mom. Keep your chin up. It can't possibly be as bad as you described. Oh, yes, it can. This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday or we will be forced to send it to collections. - Shopaholic. - Sounds like it. Yeah. Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you? Ah. This is Annie from Second Nests. I'm sorry but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother. So we're gonna hold out for that. Okay, that's enough. Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this. - No, no, no! - No, come on. Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They're all deleted. Pam, Pam. You've completely bungled this! Ah. Ahh. - Hmm. - Hey. Can I do it, Pam? Can I pull off a gold Arabian sandal? Um Yes. Definitely. - With your hair-- - Oh! Certainly. Um You dropped your cell phone. - Oh! Gosh. - Yep. Thank you. I'm So stupid. No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything. Oh, God, Pam. Don't get me started. - No, I will not. - You've just got me started. Robert Is A filthy beast. I mean, don't you get the feeling, every time he looks at you, he's just thinking of 15 different ways to do you? Well-- - I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex. But sometimes he talks about flesh And bacchanals. I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night. No Don't. Just put it out of your mind. Pam, what is your address? I'm gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don't-- Oh, yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper. Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And I have a new friend. A friend. At work. Erin. There's a call for you on line one. Who is it? He says Salvation. No last name. Yeah, hello? You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer. You're blackmailing me. - It's just business. - Ah, well. I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. But you're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don't even know my real name. I'm the fucking Lizard King. Whoa. Well, I gave him a chance. - Andy Bernard. - You got a minute? Um I'm in the middle of a piano lesson. I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Now Why would I want that? It's worth half what it was three years ago. Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management, it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today. Why don't you come in? So what would you do if you weren't selling paper? Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions. - What? - Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine. How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals. Nothing? I don't know, I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but What about you? I'd like to sell one big thing, you know? Like a plane. One sell, I'm out. That sounds lovely. Anyway, Robert is gonna run this company to the ground So We won't be doing this in six months.
Hello, my name's Oscar, I'm an accountant at Scranton, Pennsylvania, and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you, that yes, it does get better. - When I was younger - What, what's he doing? - Stretching at younger gays. - Oh No, it's just a way to tell young people no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brave future ahead. - With you. No matter how hard it gets for you, eh-- Kelly! Seriously, I-- Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam. - Do you not own a mirror? - Webcams make me look the way I look in my fantasies. - I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things. - I'm throwing out all my mirrors. - Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-- No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America mislead by some reductionist - I'm not misleading. - Pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as normal. - Mm. - It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated. - Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. - Ooh! - Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God! You okay, Robert? - Fine. - Put some ice on it. - In any case, it gets better. - Maybe-- Maybe not much better But better. At first I thought, "muffin basket." Then I thought, "what's even more precious to people than muffins?" - Can you just smile, please? - I don't want to! - Their own children. Hey, everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl! We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela! Why don't you bring by your little angel? - No, thank you. - Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them. - I know why you're doing this, Dwight. Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away velcro. And You can fill in the rest. Wha-- - Damn it, Jim! - Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious. - Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. $150,000. - Bad economy. Bad investment. - You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals? - They did not. - And you got half a million of these? - Well, I gotta try it. - I wouldn't. - Aw, come on, what's the harm? Mmm. - What flavor was that? - Coconut penis. - The coconut's pretty subtle. - Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no? - I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was, like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was-- Ooh, hold on a second. Oh. If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself. - Hi, guys. - How's it going, man? I'm-- I'm good, thank you. And how are you? - Great, yeah, good. - Oh, how the mediocre have fallen. - Oh, God. - Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity. I blew it. I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants. - No, you don't understand. - Clean the toilets. I don't need anyone to-- Pull the poop out of the toilets. - That's not even a thing. - Just, please - Andy-- - Please. - Andy. - Give me something! - Why don't you clean the carpets for today? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. - There it is. - Thank you. You don't need to-- I have a delicious secret. - Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping. - Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet? - Yeah, it is actually. Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at 3:00 today, he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me As manager. - Family picture! Pam! - No! - What? Honey, we talked about this. - No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio-slash-trap. - Yes, and then we decided that was crazy. - No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it. - No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember? - Nope. - We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child. - But are you 100% sure? I don't think any of us are. - No, no. - Nope. - But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them. - That's-- - Yes. That's-- - and we will make sure that Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y. Wait, C-R-A-Z - Great, right up there. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You just sit right here one time. - Here you go. - Okay. - All right, why don't you just - Oh, great. Thank you. - Give him to me and Perfect. - Okay, ready? - This is great. - Excuse me, hold on. - There you go. - All right. - Okay. - Let's do it. - I'll just stand here then. - Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great. - Sir, could you look into the camera? - Let's do it, shoot it. - Sir. - Great. - Up here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jim, right here, right here. - Okay, good. - Oh, so that's it? - That's it. - See? That wasn't so hard. - Cute kids, thanks for coming. - Hello, Erin. - Hello, everybody. - Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi, honey. What-- How are you doing? - Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op. Yeah. - Heh. - Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. - Thanks. - Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. - Angela. - Dwight. - Nice to see you. May I hold him? - Sure. - No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day. I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which Is impossible Because the Senator is the only man I've ever been with. - Okay, hold on a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place. - Oh, thank you. - No, no, no. I like the baby's hair the way it is. - Really? - This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. It's go time. Hey, Nellie, I made you-- I made you some soup. - Well, I don't want any soup. - But it's really good-- Oh! - Oh, come on, Andy! - I know this is going to be a great payoff. - A delicious moment. - But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake. - Well, but it-- - Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate. - Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench into the works, but I want everything to be perfect, and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me a little bit. Mm-mm, leave us alone. - I guess we're okay with the fingernails. - Okay, great. Suit yourself. - Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well? - Here. - Dwight! We're fine! - Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie? Oh, no. - I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second. - He defecated. Ooh. - You're stinky. - A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your utmost respect. Make sure that she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that? - That's some pretty blatant complimenting you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that. - Uh, Brandon? - I would. - You would? - Yeah. - Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend. - Calm down, he's not. - Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page. - So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant? - Brandon. - Good slam. - Thank you, biggie. - Good luck to you. - Oh, and have a burger for me. - Okay, shall we take a few more? - I think we have all the shots we need. - Thank you, Dwight. - Okay, here we go - No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight! - Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh? - Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you. - You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably. - I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine. - No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk. - No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is he's been taking it out on me. - You hit her? - What? - No! No! That is not the deal. Calibrate. - He's not hitting me. But he's been verbally abusing me-- That's not true either! That's also total-- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest. - Happy birthday to Gabe. - Oh, get out, skeleton man! - I can refer you to someone to talk to. - Huh? - Hold on. - Give you a name or-- I'm just gonna-- Quick-- Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. No, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears. No, next Friday That's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Damn it! Well, this is not gonna be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again. Guys, I got my old job back. - Oh, boy. - Oh, Andy. - What? - I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back. - David Wallace hasn't worked here in years. - Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It," to the US Military. - Andy, come on. - Even I know that's weird. I-- I-- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy. - Hey, Andy, nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy. - Stop saying my name. - No, he's not making this up. - Thank you, Erin. - Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time. - But have you ever actually seen him yourself? - Oh, my God. Wait. Erin, come-- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace. - Do you see David Wallace in the room right now? - Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready. - No, you look at me like you're adoring me and I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there. - I do adore you. - Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this. - Yeah, I know. - Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. Why'd they add coconut? I miss original. - Hey. - Oh, David. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey, guys. Long time. - David, what are you doing here? - Is it true you're buying the company? - Okay. I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret. But, yes, I've been talking with Andy-- What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager? - I'll get to that in a second, Andy. But it's-- It is-- It is me, right? - Yes, as we've discussed. - What? - But it's very possible-- - Oh, my God. - Probable. - Wow. From janitor to manager? - Yup. - That's quite a cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P. There's an official announcement, a few details to-- From total loss, to total boss. I mean-- Can we expect any payroll interruptions? - Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-- I was so looking forward to that and it did not Go as I thought it would. - So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore? - Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Joe Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company. - Oof. Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. I'm actually the CEO. - Aah, I didn't realize you were standing there. - Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess. - Well, okay. Well, great to meet you. - Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis. - Pleasure. - I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place. - That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that. - Please. - Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place. - Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy. - Gosh, I hope so. - No! God, Mose! God! - Hi, Angela. - Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he? Where is he? - I'm not supposed to say. - Yes! Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here! - Let's see that smile. - Right here? - Cool. Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all. - May I say one thing? - It would be rude of me not to let you Say whatever is on your mind. - The quality of mercy is not strained. - No. - It droppeth. As the gentle rain from heaven, upon the place beneath. - Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card? - It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest. - I just want one motherfucking delicious moment. Is that too much to ask? I were to hire you back-- If-- What do you think you would do well? - Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want. - All right, you sly bastard. When can you start? - Okay, everyone. Had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now, there will be no need for him. - Ouch! That's gotta hurt. - But he is going to make so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important. - What? - David has generously offered to donate $1 million in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So for the next three years, I'll be traveling overseas, concentrating on all of my efforts on educating-- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women. - I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me. - Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I wanna see these girls right through college. Especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom. - Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts? - Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun. Mm. Mm-hmm. - It's been a great year. - Hello. - Where is it? - They're testing it now. - How long does it take to get the results? - 72 hours. - You're gonna wait here? - Yes. - Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight! - Hey. - Senator Lipton. - Hey, how are you? - You didn't call. Well, the issue that concerned me You know what this is about
Andy's coming back today. Andy's coming back today. Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward-bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselor said they both grew up big time. How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made of beet run-off. Mmm. Mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news. Mr. Schrute, the results are in. - You're not the father. - I told you. Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, what a summer. An emotional roller coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot But then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles Oh, that piece doesn't go there. Shh. So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn't get the pieces to fit right. Then, one day, while I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already dead. Probably when I ran over him the first time. For us, um Nothing new, really. The kids are great. You are really good at modesty. She's a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children-- Okay, well, you had that interesting thing. Oh yeah. Yes, Jim's friend is starting a new company based on this idea that Jim had when they were back in college. It's sports marketing, basically, but the athletes are partners. And he wanted Jim to be a partner too. In Philly, so that doesn't really work for the family. But watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea. He said if it takes off, he's gonna buy us a new car. An Altima or better. Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fiance, Ravi, was hired as a Pediatrics Professor at Miami University. I don't need 'em anymore. I am going to Miami, bee-yotches, to hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan. Miami University, in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it. - Enjoy the snow, losers. - I'm so happy for you, Kelly. Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons. I've actually done a lot of market research, and it turns out that Southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It's a big university town, and, uh It's not garbage, it's my clothes. And that was our summer. - We good? - Yeah. Thanks. Don't you guys have everything? I mean, it's just a paper company. Yeah, well, we're more following you guys to see how you turn out. Oh, yeah, I guess we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well, I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids, there's just-- Nothing interesting's gonna happen to us for a long, long time. Andy's coming back today. Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out? Oh, my God. - It's called a garbage can. - Helpless. There's two new guys back there with me now. They're in their 20s, and we really get along. Looking good. Just three single guys getting into trouble. They're like the new Jim and Dwight. Oh, yes, yes. I see that. Perfect. Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face. No, thank you. My name's Pete. No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only thing we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim. Andy's here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy's here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy's here. Pam, he's here. Hey! Ahh. Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks. Yeah, right. It sounds amazing. Tell us all about it. What are you still doing here? Wonderful, thanks. You know, I had this really funny dream during outward bound that you died. Brilliant. See me in my office later. The new guys. All right. - Clark and, um - Pete. Da da da da In Outward Bound, it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called "Plop." What-- Why? 'Cause you're always taking dumps. No, I'm not. Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. You will be called "Fart" - because you fart all the time. - I love it. Actually, Andy, we call this one "Dwight Jr." No, I prefer "Fart." No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight, go stand next to him. - This is insane. - I don't see it. I don't either. I don't either. Whoa. Mind blown. It's like father and son. It's Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr.? Yes. Yes, I am. That's okay. - Dwight Jr. - Ha. In a way, it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe some day they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson. Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption. - Mmm. - The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one that you let go around naked? Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat 'em. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin. - No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants-- Comstock. - Oh. - Okay, look. He's such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants. I'll take him. Please. After the turtle? I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle! Oscar. Oscar. Will you take him? No, I'm a dog person. If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person. Those guys always turn back, Angela. David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slacklining. I ate a worm. Glad to hear it. You sound really confident and decisive. Hey, you wanted to see me? Yeah. I gotta go, David. Why is Nellie still here? You can only fire Nellie for cause. Hmm. Then I will make up a cause. Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now, if she sues, I have to testify against you. Then forget I just told you that. I can't. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. Sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean? Now I know why Michael hated you so much. No, he didn't. Good boy. Getting big and strong. Snack foods! Yep. Body by cheez-it. Ah, humor. I have it too. Oh, boy, I got a couple of tickets to The Slayer concert ten months from now. You interested? I think I'm busy that night. Oh, or I would. Mmm, okay, well, we're both just kind of learning as we go, aren't we? Learning what? Just how this is gonna be. You know. You have a beautiful round head. Okay. So what kind of farming you into, huh? More of a fruit man or a root man? Hey, is this-- is this code for, like, gay stuff? 'Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you know, you should know that I'm into the ladies. Spoken like a true root man. Hey, you know, if you're ever swamped, I can make some sales calls for you. - My calls? - So could you give me a list of all your clients, or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet? You want a list of my clients? You want my leads? Yeah, I'll just give it a glance. - Okay. - I'll give it a read. Yeah, with my leads, and stuff like that. Yeah. 'Cause you're interested in going into sales. - I am. - Wow, that's great. - Yeah. - That's great. Okay, good. Let's talk about that, okay? - Okay. - You're not getting my clients. Nice try. Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, okay? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job. Jim, get ready for the battle of your life. Done. Explain. The new guys-- Dwight Jr. is after my job. Yeah, there is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub. Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday. Wait, sales-- What sales meeting? The new guys called one. The new guys called a sales meeting? Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black? There's no belt above black. - Is there a belt above black? - You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. Too easy. Attention, everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him, but still hasn't given me a definite yes or no. - Definitely no. - Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting My ideal situation would be an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white-- I'm fine with either. But not both. Listen, you're in this, but you need to wow me, okay? I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible. Not necessarily. No, I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I will take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the "B" word, but I'm gonna be a huge bitch to you. Now, this is called slacklining. I set up the old slackline to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb. If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But if you Toby out-- Aah! Aah! Then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How 'bout a hand? Screw those guys. Now, these are my actual outward bound counselors, Rafe and Feather. - Iceman. - That's me. The powder is for your protection. Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack. You, uh-- You a sports guy? - Sure. Uh, boxing, tennis. - Oh. Any team sports? Nascar. The Amazing Race. Phillies fan, though, right? You mean horses? No, like ba-- baseball. The baseball team. I like the Red Sox. I'm from Vermont, so Okay. Good talk. I have nothing in common with Plop. All right, who's next? Nellie. Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends. Nonsense. Get up here. - Go ahead. - Come on. Uh, you gonna wear your heels? I'm very self-conscious about my feet. Okay. Sure. There you go. Atta girl. Hey, all right. Whoa! You suck. All right, who's next? Darryl. This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do. Dwight Jr., this looks like your speed. Uh, I guess I can give it a shot. Yeah, come on. Get up here. - Just hop on up. - Okay. Focus on the horizon. Whoa! Look at this guy. I've always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears. Go, Dwight Jr. - Yes! - Boo! Unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo. All right, let's see you do it. All right, let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord. Oh, ho ho ho! Who ordered the hot apple fail? Okay, I am just getting started, okay? You got this. This is all you. Oh! - Oh - Got ourselves a yard sale. - Oh. - Whoa. Balls and face. - It's not a race, Dwight. - Aah! - Oh! - Well, it's official-- Old Dwight is lame, and new Dwight is cool. That's not true. Just give me another chance. - But your mouth is-- - This is a bloodbath. All right, I'm calling this. - What? - It's enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work. This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Get-- Idiots! Slacklining. Big deal. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pigtailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope! Dwight! Pam? Hey, I'm up here. Up the ladder. Come on. What are you doing? Come here. I'll show you. Why do you want this cat? Um, I don't want it, really. How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions? I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things-- Travel. Make the world a better place. Earn an MBA at night. Have you taken any concrete steps? Well, I'm still just fitting in here. You know, getting used to the new job. - Mm-hmm. - But definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list. Oh, come on, Pete. God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years doing nothing. Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim. Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it is literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole, - I will? - You will. Yeah, we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say? - Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds. - So you'll do it? - No. - Come on! This will be the only thrill of your boring life. Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life - Come on. - Exactly the way it is. - No, Pam. - Yes. And there's nothing you can say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it. - Please? Please, Pam? - Find someone else. I don't know, ask Phyllis. I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive! Why are you getting rid of it? Allergies. - Your husband? - No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night. You know what? I will take Comstock. Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you! I'll come by after work and pick him up. Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won't get to say good-bye. He has this business dinner tonight. Oh, c'est la vie. Please don't teach the cat French. Yeah, good news. Tonight, when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock. You ready? Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. I've just gotta make a quick call. Okay. Okay. All right Oh, God. Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool 'cause they can slackline. Ooh! Hey, Clark, this is what a real salesman looks like. They say that you only live once, and I'm about to prove it. - Dwight Schrute! - Dwight! Hey, man, it's Halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great. Don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Okay, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! - Call somebody. - Hang on! Hang on! Hold on, Dwight! In the parking lot today, there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high wire. A lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator. A strongman crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company. Crap, sorry, Nellie. Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins, instead of tossing them, then we would-- Oh Swish. Oh, it's nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are. There are two things that I am passionate about-- Recycling and revenge. Flook.
The building's custodian is on vacation for the month, and Dwight is too chip to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth, but, not for long because I have created the chore wheel. Oh, yeah. Can I spin first? Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning, and you see what chore you get that day. A wheel is supposed to spin. Yeah, you know, like "guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh guh-guh-guh-guh-h-guh--" - No, I'm familiar with spinning. It's just that wouldn't work with the chore wheel because people might get the same chore-- - Yuck. Boring. All she talks about is chores. A wheel wants to spin, Pam. Spinning would be more fun. Okay. Okay, that's what I'm talkin' about. - Woo! - Wow! - Spinning! - Big money, big money. Yeah! Mug duty? Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink. This sucks. Yeah, seriously, it's like everything on there's work. I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. - It's-- - Yeah, and I don't think that you understand wheels. I've been through several rounds of development with the team, and here's where we stand with the chore wheel. We've got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour. But there are also penalties, like no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores, but they were right. It's more fun this way. Oh! Ahh! Whoo! - Tiny wheel! - Tiny wheel! - Tiny wheel! Tiny wheel! - There it is! The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It's so cute, no one seems to mind. - Toilets! - Aww. - Tiny wheel. - Lucky! - Good choice. - Woo!  Pam, we gotta go! Cece, go back inside. Grandma's got breakfast, okay? We are going to Roy's wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife's ex-fiancee's wedding on a weekday at 8 AM is that it's your wife's ex-fiancee. Thanks, mom! - Banana? - Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs. Oh, come on, not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding. I planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs. Just-- it's so weird. Oh, Pete, you've got mail. Really? I got somethin'? Well, it's addressed to customer service, so it's your mail. Well, you know, I'm also customer service. Yeah, I'm alternating. Yay. Another person yellin' at me. Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time. That's really nice. Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election thing is crazy, right? It's open. Oh, yeah. I accidentally read it. It's not a nice letter. Okay. Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived. I know you don't really exist. Today, I launch my big charity initiative, "Operation Give Back." Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far, but this one is about charity so I'd like to see him piss on that one. Darryl! Ho-o-o! What's happenin'? Congratulations, baby. Yeah. Oh, thank you. - Is this his house? - Think so. Mimosa? - I'm okay. - Thank you. Would you like me to take your peel? Yes, thank you. Okay. Who's that? - Uh, my ex-fiancee. - Ha-ha. I started a new business with my college friend, but Pam doesn't know. Um, actually I-- I did tell Pam, and we decided no, but then I decided "yes, anyway," so I'm thinking there's another conversation coming, and it's hard to know when that will be. With "Operation Give Back," you pick the charities Dunder Mifflin supports. Aw, boy. What's happening? There's $4,000 to give away, so who has filled out their forms? - Stanley? - American Diabetes Association. Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity? I, uh, I would love to give-- Heifers International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like a goat or something. It's a great prank. I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and Help Build Gnomes. Dwight, what about you? I will not be participating, as there is no evidence that charity works. Uh, correction-- I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling-- Changes Lives. - Thank you, Andy. - I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling. Dwight, you will be participating. - No, thank you. - Participation is mandatory, Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like. Fine, I choose the Global Relief Foundation - Great, thank you-- - which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban! - Oh, for goodness' sake. - Oh, yeah. The Taliban in Af-a-ghanistan. The Taliban is the worst. Great heroin, though. Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of "Operation Give Back." Well, then, it looks like there won't be any "Operation Give Back." The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what? Aw, yeah. We appreciate everyone coming so early. Everyone's just been so nice. Thanks for inviting us, by the way. - That was-- that was a surprise. - Are you kidding me? Come on, if it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. But seriously, could've dodged a bullet on that one. - Just kidding. - You're welcome. Thanks. Ohh. By the way, man, this place is beautiful. I started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it would take off? - Gravel company. - Yeah. - What about you? - What are you doing? Not gravel, obviously. Nah, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works, so - Oh, cool. - Yeah, you never know. Hey, bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. He's got a $50,000 sports car. - Cheers. - Okay, Kenny. Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out, but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed, huh? Hold on-- hold on! Erin, do you know anybody that might-- Oh, my gosh. You love the news, right? Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad. Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer, and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind. Uh, is it Duncan? He's looking for on-air talent, and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape. You mean put me on the news? You'll just come over, put on a little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine, and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful, and it'd really help me out with Duncan-- with my friend. What'd you say? Ehh-- No, maybe, okay? Let me think about it. Okay. - Woo. - Think it over. No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn and Rob, but you don't know them. I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist, but why? Because I happened to answer a "help wanted" ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO or for a brain surgeon? So, uh, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress, and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl, and today, I have a surprise for you. He plays piano? No. Roy? No. You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this, um, so, I hope that you like it. You got this, Roy.  She's got a wa-a-ay about her   don't know what it is   but I know that I can't live without her   she's got a way--  We still surprise each other. Definitely. You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday, I really wanted to surprise you. Courtside seats. Sixers. Yes, but what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-- It was an away game. In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. Do we know everything about each other? No. Tell me one thing about you I don't know. Um, okay. Oh, there's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement and bought the winning numbers the next day, and then, played the tape for me the next week-- And you thought you guys were millionaires. You heard that one. Yes, but there's-- Wait. Oh! There's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember. That I thought we were millionaires. That you thought you were millionaires. - Yep. - That's funny. - Shoot, I knew that one! - That's all right. The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. You all right? You support the Taliban abroad, so I assume you're willing to live by their rules here. Anything else would be inconsistent. Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? Absolutely, I will. I feared Nelly had some sort of a plan, You don't have a plan! no one thinks you have a plan. Looking for this? What the-- Oh, this is a lovely pen, and it's mine now, because I stole it. - Gimme that. - Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been a theft. That means you're not serious, or someone's getting their hand cut off. - You're insane. - I know, so it's better that you pick another charity. Oh, and let your precious "Operation Power Grab" proceed unchecked? No, thank you. In that case, you will have to chop off my hand. This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together, just you and your hand, tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two-hand activities that you'll miss the most. I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands. Sounds like a plan. Clark wants to film you in different outfits - inside his apartment? - Yeah. Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition? Uh, a couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe a-- no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut, because the camera makes everything seem higher-cut. - Really? - Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those pantyhose with the seam up the back. Seems unnecessary for an audition. And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes, but I probably got one that she could borrow at my place, so-- Thank God someone here knows what they're talkin' about. I want you to take this credit card. Take Erin to the mall, and get that stuff. I absolutely will do that. Awesome. Plop. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then, buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits. That Clark, huh? Next question for our oldyweds. What is the craziest place you ever made whoopee? Language. Who was Pam's first celebrity crush? - Oh, this is good, okay. - Pam's first celebrity crush. John Stamos. - Ready? - Uh-huh. - John Stamos. - Oh, yes! John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to Johnny-- Johnny Depp. Uh, um, I was having a separate conversation with Kevin? Uh, Johnny Depp. Totally. George Clooney. Mm-hmm. Okay, I'll have one. I have one. Where is the craziest place you ever made whoopee? Kevin, stop it with that question. Right? And did you show them the market-- yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome. That-- aw, my God. Wow. It's not even real yet, and I'm not gonna tell her until it's real. I think maybe they're actually is something I don't know about Jim. Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence. Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. Good. Great job. Andy made me his consigliere, which means assistant regional manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather because I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black. Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. - Wow! - Woo! - Uh-huh. - Congratulations! And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin, so everybody say something that you like about her body, all right? - Darryl. - Okay. Um, I like Erin's hair. Those are very pretty colors. - Yeah, right? - I'm sorry. - This is for a news audition? - Yeah. Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility or her reliability? News flash, everyone-- the human race finds attractive people more trustworthy. So sorry, Andy, but for 20 years, the most trusted man in America Walter Cronkite. Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that moustache ride. Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Has she done the pageant circuit? - No, I watch the news-- - She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen. This is a first for me, and I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job. - Whatever it takes. - Yeah, I know, I heard. This is it. - Any questions? - Is it gonna be numb? No, it's gonna be over before you know it. Mm-hmm. Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country, promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. "Aren't you glad you waited?" Karzai commented. Um, where did you get that story? A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events. I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name. For Channel 11 News, I'm Erin Hannon. Pause after news. For Channel 11 News, - I'm Erin Hannon. - No, pause longer. - That was a good one. - Pause-- pause-- pause longer. Okay, build suspense. Don't be shy. Got it. For Channel 11 News What, it's-- - I'm Erin Hannon. Okay, all right. Great. Some great stuff in there. I can feel you looking at me. Okay, well here's something you don't know. - A couple of weeks ago - Mm-hmm. I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced, and he hit on me in the mall. And I didn't tell you because-- I don't know, I felt embarrassed, and I didn't know if you'd be mad or worried, but anyway, I thought you'd wanna know. That didn't happen. You would've told me right away. Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me. Uh Just tell me. God, give it up, Beesly. You know me too well. - Hey. - Hmm. Um, I knew something bothered me, and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna wanna see is how Erin relates to the other people - on the news team. - Oh. The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone. Oh, God. Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host. He's already doing camera. Somebody who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. Hey, this is for real this time. It's gettin' late. Thought you guys could use a little inspiration. Oh, a movie. - What is this? - 127 Hours. - It's about this guy who-- - No, no, no, no, - no spoilers. Please. - My bad, my bad-- - No-- - You're right, okay. Good night. - Hey! - Hey. - Everybody. - Yeah. - Come in. - All right. - Come on in. - Wow! Thanks. What are you doing here? Sorry, man. Andy thought Erin need a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied. The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns. Oh, wow. You know what they say, Erin? If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. Well, he tried to, but the fire door was blocked. - He sure did. - All right. We got that. That's a rap everybody. It's just-- you sure, Clark? Yep, she's done. No, I just-- I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that. Oh, no, we got it. We got it. Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving. I don't think we did get it. I could do a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing. Okay, I don't. All right. I'm hungry. Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something? - Yeah, whatever you say, boss. - Okay. - I'll call you later. - Okay. - Okay. - Great job. So this is a single. Hey, even this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it, and maybe it'll work out for Andy. Oh, that is absolutely revolting! - Yeah. - He is so good, though Yes. The way he just cuts off his arm. If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes. Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU - all at the same time. - Whoop-de-doo. That doesn't make you a genius. Well, it doesn't make you stupid. Oh, yeah, it does. Actually, it makes you - real stupid. - Oh, stupid like you. - No, like you. - Like you. - You're the stupid one. - You're the stupid one. - You, you, you, you, you-- - You're the stupid one.
Good morning, Dwight. Who are you? Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for 12 years. Weird joke, Dwight. You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian. You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race. All right then, Jim. Uh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday? Uh, Wellington Systems? Sold them ten cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me. Please enter your password. You have one new message. How did you know? No! No, no. That is sensitive information. Only for employees, not outsiders! Dwight, cut it out. I'm trying to work. You don't work here! You're not Jim! Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. - Grico's, 7:30. - Oh, great. Can't wait. Jim's at the dentist this morning, and Steve is an actor friend of ours. I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim! Oh, my-- oh, d-- oh, how did--  Hey, study buddies! Oh-- okay. Getting Things Done. Awesome! It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved myself 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it. Since Andy promoted me to Assistant Regional Manager, I've been trying to step my game up. You know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let's knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. Whoa. That person has really gotten him-- or herself-- into quite a predicament. S'il vous plait Dites-moi Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat. I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there. You want to learn a really impressive second language? Try Dothraki. Win over any man in my guild. Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic, war-mongering horse lords of Essos, as featured in the superb Home Box Office series Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads. I could teach you if you want, it's a lot easier than French. Yeah. Let's do it. - Athdavrazar! - Oh-- It means "excellent." And we have begun. Is everything okay? Hmm? Oh-- oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine. I mean, I d-- I just don't want to burden you with my massive stress freak-outs. Great. It's just that I am taking my driver's license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to "Demandy." I just want to hit the open road and drive, man. But in whose car? Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here. Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime. Oh, Pam, thank you. You are my savior. - Oh, my God-- - Ohh-- I'm sorry I'm leaving you alone for lunch. Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try. This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a printout of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com. Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights. Well, it turns out you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama. - As in-- - Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children. Wow. This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us. My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama. I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, "what's your stance on politics?" Or, "what is the best war to do?" And I will just be like, "duh--" All right! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but, uh, I'm related to Michelle Obama. Yeah, we noticed early on Andy really appreciates enthusiasm. So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders. Ohh! It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome. Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point. Just clap through it, man. You're logging sales at ten different times. If you log 'em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching. This is really good, Darryl. Life hacking, man. There he is! Andy, you gotta check this out. He just-- Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual who also has a killer singing voice is related to the First Lady. Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross. It's me! I'm related to Michelle Obama. What? Really? I mean, it's distant, but-- That's cool, man. Right? Darryl said, "cool, man." He called me a cool man. You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat. Mm-- the thing is, Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I'm driving, so I might as well get good at it. Brake lights. Brake lights, brake lights, brake lights! Whoo! I'm just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person? You think that Andy's family owned slaves? Well, somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy. I throat-rip. Foth aggendak. You throat-rip. Foth aggendi. He-she-it throat-rips. Foth aggenda. More of a barbaric growl. Foth aggenda. Louder. You're shouting it from the back of a horse. Foth aggenda! Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh? Yeah. It's almost unbelievable. What? Well, do you know how Andy has been really salting my onions lately? Sure. Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up. So he's not related to Michelle Obama? Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer. Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun. Pam! Well, if there's another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I-- What's going on here? I'm related to the First Lady, okay? Get over it. I still need weekly status reports from most of you. So can we get back to work, please? Get back to work. Andy-- Andy, no! I would be very polite today. Why, is it employees' day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays. Your connection to Michelle Obama has certain negative connotations. Most likely, your family were slave owners. Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners? Whoa. That person has really gotten him-- or herself-- into quite a predicament. Hey, mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance. Got a quick question for you. Uh, no big deal, just about America's national shame. Thanks, bye. Where were we? Uh-- yes, okay. Your productivity thing. Yes, yes, yes. Great. Ooh, spreadsheets. Yum, yum. I included some time-saving ideas. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm a teensy bit distracted right now. Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird. Right on, brother. Word dat. Mm-- - Ador! - Daras. Qazer! Daras. Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk? Hey, Erin. Atchomar chomakaan! Oh-- okay. Sorry. Oh, still, it must be great to have something else going on outside of work. Yeah-- turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again-- those are the wipers. So the-- it's just-- there you go. Yeah. Yeah, things get so busy with the kids-- red light-- that it's nice to have that creative outlet-- red light, red light, red, red-- That is brilliant, Pam. I'd love to see some of your work. Well, since we're stopped at a light uh, here is the mural I did for Angela's baby. That is amazing, Pam. Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo. Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed. Hey, has anyone turned in their status reports up here? Vos. So no? Do you think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to downplay the whole bossy-boss thing today. Because of your slaves. Not my slaves, my ancestors'. Maybe. Probably not. Well, if it makes you feel any better, the Dothraki word for "slave master," azzafrok, is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak Dothraki. Color you impressed? - That you're learning a made-up language from HBO's Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today, but this was a great nerd-out. Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language. People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it. Hi, guys. Hey, boss. I am so thirsty, can I have a scoop of water? Yeah. You don't have to ask me-- Ha ha. Okay, great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happened to be-- Very funny, Kevin changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone. Which, you may remember, was Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes by Paul Simon, featuring, Ladysmith African-American Mombazo. Good. Very good. Oh-- no. Here, it's, uh, a text from Andy. "New special proj. Need fam. Tree for evbody. "Really dig up dirt. ASAP." And then in parentheses he wrote out, "as soon as possible." Mm. Ugh, looks like it's pretendy time again. Write back, "looking for dirt." Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, um, Tonya Harding. Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding. Oh-- gee, I'm-- No, I'm just practicing my lying. - I love it. - Brilliant. What should we say about Jim? Um, oh-- uh, say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixony when he wakes up. My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying, none of the sexual charisma. I just made a joke then. I'm sorry. It's just, um-- I actually do have this weird feeling that there's something Jim isn't telling me. Oh, no. Ugh, an affair. It is always an affair. Jim? No. How can you be sure? Because he just loves me too much. You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam? I have done a little genealogy research of my own. Turns out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol' family closet. For example, Phyllis' great-great-grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States. Ew. Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt. And John Wayne? No. Not that I see here. Wayne Johnson? The Rock? You mean Dwayne, and no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh-oh. Turns out, distant relative of the reviled Richard Nixon. Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean, there's nothing there. Tru-- Oh, no. Dwight's grandfather-- Was a member of the Bund, which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So-- I was gonna say he was a tax evader. Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh-ho, the look on your faces. And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden. Cool. Stop it! Stop it, you're frightening me. Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families? Yeah, that-- you're being really mean. No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past, and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it. The difference is, Andy, that you're the only one here still benefitting from the terrible things your ancestors did. Might have done, and how do you figure? Your family's rich. I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves. You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar. I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth could one day benefit society, if capital gains are ever taxed at the same rate as earned income. Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie. Hey, mom. How are you? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the South? She said no. Take that! Follow-up question, did any Bernards ever make money in an unsavory way? I just asked you-- why didn't you used to say that? Okay, stop, stop. Stop talking. Stop talking. That's-- no. I don't want to know that. Okay, you're interrupting a meeting. I have to go. Love you. Bye. Well, turns out the Bernards of yore did not own slaves. Really. We merely transported them. Which, at worst, makes us amoral middlemen. Yo, D-Dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a sore difficult childhood than I actually had. - You gonna po' mouth. - Exactly. Help me po' mouth, Darryl. Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions-- What if I said that my dad beat me, and I just left out the croquet of it all? Or, I could just go all the way and say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy? That could work. You know, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here. I'm going for a walk. Okay. Good Good, and-- You doing all right, man? I'm done. I gotta get out of here. Yeah. Not the easiest day to be Assistant Regional Manager. It's not just today, it's every day. Seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets. Aw, come on, it can always get better, right? Hmm. Yeah, right. No, I'm serious. There's always something better. Like what? Like, hypothetically, if I said that there was another job that you and I could both have. What kind of job? Something cool, like sports marketing, or-- does that sound like something you'd be into? - Hell yeah. - Right? That sounds awesome. Okay, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly? - So you'd have to-- - I love Philly. Right? - It's not even a thought-- - Not even a thought. It's not even that far away, I could still commute-- exactly. Exactly. All right. What? Wait, wait, wait. So what, is this happening? Oh, it's happening. Let's just keep it between you and me - for right now, all right? - Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure, for sure, for sure. Man. And Pam's into it? We gotta have a talk about it, but I think that she's-- I think she understands - Aw, come on, man. - what this is. I thought you had something real. What? No, no, no. Come on. This is real. It's not real until your wife is on board. So what did you want to show me? That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it? Yeah. It's really ugly. Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking, a mural. You mean me? Yes, you. You are so talented. It's going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton's most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall. Oh, my God, I love it! Uh-- I-- Nellie, this is brilliant! - Hey! - Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you. What? No, I-- I got this. Okay. Okay. This is his fault. It is not your fault. I am gonna find you someone better, and rich. And Filipino. But we'll break that to her later. You know what this is all about? Yeah. You too, huh? Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, you snake. Hey. He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too. Yeah. Oh, Pam, no. Oh, I can't bear to watch this. I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world. I still can't believe he didn't tell me. I was helping Nellie drive-- Do not care. Fonas chek! Dothras chek! I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith. Hmm--
All right, everybody. Great season of softball, I'm super proud of you, guys. And I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I've put together. Dunder Mifflin! Andy Bernard presents Summer Softball, epic fails! Fail. Fail. - That's me. - Fail. Is this like a blooper reel? A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? Do I look like Bob Saget? Fail! Who's this guy?  Meow, meow, meow, meow meow, meow, meow, meow  Look at him dance. Fail! Fail. I deserve that.  Doont-de-doont-de-doont, doont-de-doont-de-doont  That was a triple. Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video! My pleasure. Hi, I'm Pete. Puberty is such a drag, man. And I'm Clark. I like to eat toilet paper. We fail. I'd like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry, in the warehouse, who passed away this year. Well, that's all, folks. Ski you later, everybody. Thanks for a great season. What was that? That was just normal video with you making vulgar noises. Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time, do more fail-ier stuff, okay? What happened to that video I sent you? Oh, that wasn't-- that didn't work. That was not the right thing. - Wait, let's see it. - Play it. - I think I got it right here. - No-- Oh! Forgot about this. That was not a fail. That was actually a serious accident that could've resulted in severe bodily harm. - Fail, fail, fail. - You're all failing right now. Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail. Oh, God. What's going on? Nothing, nothing is going on. Keep moving, please. What's he measuring? Okay, excuse me, I'm the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else, please. It's an EMF hotspot. Oh, my God! It stands for electromagnetic fields generally caused by a concentration of wiring in one area, especially if poorly insulated. Dwight? Um, okay, I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there's a beehive in the wall? You think I have a machine for measuring beehives? I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour? Well, I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven. Okay, listen, everything here is up to code. Oh, the wires need insulation. It's a wire, people. I'm not buying it a fur coat. - Thank you. - You got it. Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job - I took in Philly, the side job. - Thank you. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now, I just want to do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar, and she mouthed off to some bikers, and they came lumbering over, and I was like, "wham! Gotta go through me first." Andy, could I have a word, please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important, and it really has to happen now. Fine, I will give you one minute-- Oh, please, don't use the hourglass. You have one minute, and your minute has begun, and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of its baroque-dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase. I'm trying to adopt a baby. A baby what? A human? And the agency require character reference from my employer. Oh. You won't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself. You'd just need to sign it, so-- Okay, and fall right into your plagiarism-entrapment scheme? - I don't think so. - It's not-- And I happen to notice you're down to about 30 seconds here. Well, then, if I could just convince you that you-- And those sand grains are tumbling with fury down-- It's not entrapment if I'm writing-- Time's up! Fine. Sure, I'll read her letter, and if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then, yeah, I'll sign that. "Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards, but mainstream studies are inconclusive." That means you can't make me do squat. You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus, and I ain't losing any more good parts. You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. I'd have to shut this place down for a week. Week off. That'd be great. Hey, if you don't want to teach me PowerPoint, just say so. I don't want to teach you PowerPoint. Come on. Just show me PowerPoint. - Just do the tutorial. - You're the tutorial. No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial. - You could be. - Mm-mm. What are you doing? Getting my wife a week off from work. You popped one kernel. Awesome, right? So creed is that dude's stepdad? Correct. Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm just going to say it; I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all going to cause. - He's right. - What? Come on. I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair. - I'm sorry. - I'm gonna grow a third arm. I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big, bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job, while Lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well, sorry, Lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their powers that way. Side effects of EMF include headaches-- Had them all my life. Breast pain-- No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try, Jim. Oof. Infertility. Yeah, right. Ah, there's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me? Keep your snacks on your side, Jim, idiot. - What the--? - What? Some of these kernels have crowned. That's impossible 'cause that's a brand-new bag. Oh, my God. Andy! I'm going to drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water, just you, me, and the kids. Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way? You mean, "Laverne's Pies, Tires Fixed Also"? Yes. We will be doing that, and we'll be getting a dozen. A dozen different pies? 'Cause that means rhubarb. Why would you say that? I meant four apple, four blueberry, two cherry, one peach, one chocolate. I thought that was implied. Yeah, okay, then. Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints, and we reached a settlement. So We will be leaving the office for one whole week. Nice job. In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour. What? - What's this? - Oh! - What? - Bring it in. Roll into the future with work bus. Say good-bye to wasteful buildings. These days, a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. In this age of belt-tightening and less-empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done. - Shh! - Shh! Shh! $23.99 a page, yes. - Six. Yes. - Yeah. Oh, sorry about that. Oh, my God! Oops. Sorry. Lose weight. I'm trying. Sorry. Ah. The Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare pre-adoption standard? Oh, of course, you were adopted. I wish. No, I made some short lists, I had a couple of sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end-zone. I don't know what it was. Not lovable, maybe? Oh, well. Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, do you think maybe you could-- Absolutely, I know exactly what they want to hear. I would-- I would love to help. Oh, thank you so much. Just don't tell Andy because-- - He hates me. - And-- - Thinks I'm a monster. - That-- - Should go back to Loch Ness. Stretch. All right. How many times do you need to take a stroll? I-- my legs cramp up, okay? It's a circulation issue. Boy, I will hammer-spank your rear. All right, all right, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face. It's a medical thing. Just-- You good? I'm good. I-- I'm so sorry for all of this. It's okay. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest. I-- I need to get to the paper, please. Sorry. Oh, God! - Oh, oh, my God! - Okay-- - Oh! - I'll get you a napkin. Can someone get napkins, please? You know what, it's fine. It's fine, let me just-- It's fine. Pam, I'm really sorry. I just-- I'm-- I'm really sorry about all that. Really? Smirking? What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and now you're locked in a prison bus, and your woman drips with beverage. Hey, Dwight, I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere, or do something to not make this the worst day ever? It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas. Andy! Yo! Toonces. You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work, we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania? Ooh, I know I'd be more productive. - As would I. - No question. No! No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site. What are you talking about? You're not the boss, Andy is. Andy? Pies, pies, pies, pies, pies, pies. All right! The fat people have spoken. Dwight, get this bus moving. Next stop, Laverne's Pies, Tires Fixed Also. Oh, yes! Yeah, Jim! So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh? Get your foot behind the yellow line. You got it. Yeah, Jim! - Stop. - Come back. - Too late. - Mm.  Shabooya roll call, shabooya-ya-ya   shabooya roll call  -  My name is Pam  -  Yeah   I like to paint  -  Yeah  -  You think you're better?  -  Yeah  -  Oh, no, you ain't   Roll call   Shabooya-ya-ya   shabooya roll call, shabooya-ya-ya   shabooya roll call  -  My name is Kevin  -  Yeah  -  That is my name  -  Yeah  -  They call me Kevin  -  Yeah  -  'Cause that's my name  -  Roll call   shabooya-ya-ya shabooya roll call   shabooya-ya-ya shabooya roll call  Thanks. Playing a little hooky from work today. Oh, my God. Dunder Mifflin road trip 2012! Okay, now a serious one. Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kind of weird to you lately? If by "lately," you mean for the last 12 years, yeah. No, I mean, he's sulking. That's not like him. He's just mad that we're all having fun. Then why isn't he scheming or preparing to avenge? He's fine. He's indestructible. Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages. Although I have considered kidnapping one. Oh, and never say that. I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt. I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five-year-old again. I would snap you up. Oh. Next stop, pies. Next stop, pies! Next stop, pies, next stop, pies! Let's go, driver! Laverne packs up the pie wagon at 5:00, so-- At 5:00? That's only 20 minutes from now. The pie shop is 13 miles away. So at 55 miles an hour, that just gives us So, wait, when pies are involved, you can suddenly do math in your head? Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies? What if it were salads? Well, it's the-- carry the four and the-- it doesn't work. I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage, everyone, but we're almost out of gas. Okay, well, I saw a station about a mile back, so chop, chop. That name brand place? No, forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, 5Â¢ a gallon extra? It really adds up. Are you kidding me? - Dwight, come on. - Hey. Honey, I don't think we should push him. Oh, no, I'm going to push him. You know why? Because you are getting a pie. Why? 'Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside, looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want? No! Stop ordering me around, Jim! - What do we want? - Pies! When do we want it? - Pies. - Okay, fine. You win, Jim. You win. We have been battling for a long time, but, you know what, you win. 'Cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male. There you go. Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie. That's impossible. - Oh, no! - Dwight! - What are you doing? - Dwight! - What the hell? - Whoa, Dwight. - Dwight. - What? Well, now I don't even feel like pie. Wait. No, it's back. Just drive away. Phyllis, that's not safe. Guys, we only have At 61 miles an hour, we're just going to barely make it. Go up and check on him, he's upset. You know he's doing all this on purpose. Please, just make sure he's okay. Hurry it up, for God's sake. They're going to be out of banana cream. Banana cream's the first to go. We'd be lucky to get pumpkin at this point. What? Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I'm trying to do something for my wife, and you keep-- - I'm barren, Jim. What? My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela, and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. Thought I would be a father, and instead I am a eunuch, neutered by my own building. Is this about the popcorn, or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank. You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank? - No. - That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. I'll take it. Andy? Who is it? - Um, is this a good time? - Yeah. Perfect time, right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. Fine, yeah, let me read it. What do we have here? Okay-- You've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable. Oh. What, is there something--? It's inaccurate, dishonest, and, in a word, dong-water. Oh, well, perhaps I could reword some of it-- Here's the thing. You asked me to do you a favor, I did it, I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream. All right, then. Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant. Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive? That doesn't matter. What position did you use to conceive, regular or lady-on-her-back? You used lady-on-her-back, didn't you, freak? Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim. British women, famously over-emotional, am I right? I don't think that's Nellie. - What? - Oh. Oh, no, no, no. It's all right. Really, it isn't your fault. No, no. It's-- You were so kind, and it isn't anything to do with you. Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kind of like your children. You know, there's a phrase about that in German, bilden-kinder, used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves, but now, I really understand it. Well, now you have a bus full of real building-kinder. - Bilden-kinder. -  Okay. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me. - I agree. - Oh! Oh. Hey, how did it go? - It was pretty good, actually. - Yeah? We bonded, we got to t-- - Oh! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Dwight, Dwight! - Dwight! That's what happens when you don't get out of the way. Out of the way! You feel okay now? Oh, better than okay. And you know what, honey? I'm going to get you that rhubarb pie. Well, actually, rhubarb - is the one pie that I don't-- - Don't, don't. Everybody, hang on! Pie, pie, pie, pie, pie, pie! Oh. I changed my mind. - Oh, you signed it? - Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple of changes, added some sentences at the end. Trust me, it needed it. But, yeah, whatever. "She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents." - I insult you, Oscar. - What? I insult you to your face. I don't know what you're talking about. Then why don't you do something about it? Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you in the face with my pie? You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo-doo face. Yes! Oh, my God. I'm getting so stuffed. We did it. You did it. -  My name is Andy  -  Yeah  -  I don't do drugs  -  Yeah  -  Now, check the style  -  Yeah  -  Of flatt and scruggs  -  Yeah  Roll call. Roll call. Roll call. Roll call. What?
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.  decision I've ever made. My  head went into the pumpkin no problem - It won't . - but I can't get it out. Try again. I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin No! No! No! No! Please! But as Jim and I discovered No! any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me. At first, I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should've done differently. Yes, Dwight. I never should've played that joke on Erin. I never should've hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. But then I realized I was being silly. I mean, the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two right? - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Pam, what are you? - I'm Doctor Cinderella. Cece's really into princesses now, so we decided to turn them into positive female role models. I'm an oncologist. And you are a dog. No, I'm a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen. - It's okay. - Um, Jim, you're not dressed up at all. Sure I am. I am one of the Men In Black guys. Can I have your sunglasses? Jim, come on. I thought we were past this. So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me? There's a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume. Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me. Getting a lot of mileage out of this, aren't you? Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.  A jitterbug  You guys look great! The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions? The senator will be joining us later. Not a question. - No, it wasn't. - Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble! -  I'm a man  -  A man   without conviction   you come and go, you come and go   Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon   you come and go, you come and go   loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams   red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green   karma come on  Ah! So good! What lab did these little clones escape from? My Cornell a cappella group. You were in an a cappella group? You went to Cornell? Yeah. Uh, okay, ha, ha, ha, ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are, because HCT is doing a set at our Halloween party. Ugh, I don't want to sit through a whole concert of that. I do. I love the boss's interests. Atta boy, Clark. Where you boys staying? How does it work in the rooms? You get a privacy partition? No. No, nope, not-- No, stay away. You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared. Are you sure you're okay with me putting in this much money? Yeah. I mean, listen, if we're gonna do this thing, then we should do it right. You're the best. I kind of am. - It's crazy. - Okay. - I'll see you in a little bit. - Okay. Jim, look, I'm eating you. - Shut up. - Ha, ha! Hey, Erin, look, these are nerds. I'm eating Jims. Must eat more Jims. Stop it! Stop it! - I'm spilling Jims - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - All over the carpet, Erin! - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Mm. Mm. Hello, little pill. What do you do? Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation, there's a madman in our midst. Okay, I give up. What are you? I'm Sexy Toby. Gross. I love it. Dumatril! Something wrong, Dwight? - Dumatril. - Yes? This is a pill I found here in the office, but it's not for worms or eczema, like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body. It's for a disorder of the mind. The mind is part of the body. Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane they are now off their meds. Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business, so-- Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on, Nellie? - Talk to me. - Mm? It's my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I'm not ashamed of that, but I'm not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong. Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended. I'll get my apprehension kit.  Dudes  What's up? I know it's pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that's when I became somebody. When I got the nickname Boner Champ, that is when I became me. You didn't come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational "bro" time. Well, now's your chance! I'm here. You got Qs, I got As. Did you say you've got AIDS? No, I don't have AIDS. That's not what I said. Next question. You don't have any-- any questions about the old days? You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ? I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ. I'm sorry, what? I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ. Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ. - I hadn't realized that everybody here dresses up every year. - Me neither. It's Halloween. That is really, really good timing. I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you're Boner Champ. I'm so sorry. I don't know how that could've happened. Did you maybe tell them that or-- I just-- I just started yappin' about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky. Could you call them and just tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it's really stupid, but it's also really, really, really important. Will do. I love you, Andy. Love you too. So the workspace looks awesome. - Wow. - And the graphic designer is gonna be sending us in some of the logo treatments. Can't wait to see them. - You guys rock. - I killed it. - Boom. - Rockin'. Oh. - You get some? - There we go. I also have been running the numbers, and between our backers and our own investment, we're looking great for a full year on this. Oh, uh, is it too late to get in? Oh, no, no. Jim, I explained everything, so you're all set. Oh, no, I actually talked to my wife, and we'd really like to, you know, invest, get in on the ground floor. Wow, well, what level of investment are you thinking about? We were thinking somewhere between $5,000, $10,000. I can do the full $10,000. We should just all in. All right, welcome aboard. All right. Awesome, cool. Hey, Darryl. I'm just here to Smear some peanut butter on my forehead. You know, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning. That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound crazy? I can't really picture it. Can you get it on there? Yeah. And maybe get the cheeks. So this makes sense, then. Or is it crazy? Get under your chin first, yeah. Is that where the nanobots like to come in? Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah. Okay, is that how they like to get in? Yeah, that's crazy. I don't know. I just don't know. Yo, bad boys of a cappella. Hey. Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories? Yeah, I got a call from Broccoli Rob. I guess you really are the Boner Champ. Did he tell you how I got the name? No. Spring sing '95, got completely ripped on bud dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would've stopped most people, but I stayed locked in. You know, took the face off. Just seemed easier that way. And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted, so anyway - Hi. Oh, Oscar. - Oh. Remember my husband, the senator? Senator Lipton, nice to see you. Nice to see you, Oscar. Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem. So, Oscar, you're a dinosaur? Actually, I'm the electoral college. Ouch! Right on target. You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry, babe. Phyllis! God, it's just so good to see you. I-- uh-huh, just All having this wonderful Halloween gathering. Excuse me, is that punch? They didn't know about the snowman story, and when I told 'em, they were not impressed. - What is with these turkeys? - Right? Hey! You better do Faith, you get me? We don't know it. So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you're like eight Rain Men. Just learn the frickin' song. Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but-- Buts are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out and make it a surprise please. This isn't stupid. What? - Hey. - Hey. Hey, Toby. Are-- are you me? Yeah. Oh, my goodness, look at-- - Look at this. - Yeah. I thought I'd, you know, be you. - Look at-- look at me. - Oh, look at you! It's funny, right? Mm. All right, all right, just stay focused on the pill. Okay, look, Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety. You think I don't have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes to settle and idiot cousins to protect and ne'er-do-well siblings to take care of, but I don't need some stupid pill to get me through all this. Cool, free upper. Ah, ha, ha! The jig is up, psychopath! - What? Hey, what-- - Yeah! Yeah, gotcha! - Don't dog-catch me! - Gotcha! - Yeah! - Oh! Let's see you get out of this web, huh? - The pill is mine. - Wh-- Get her out. - Oh. - Stop baggin' my head! Oh, Dwight, look, it's just a pill, all right? It's for anxiety-- I take it every day, and it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too. - Oh, hey! How'd it go? - Hey. Oh, man, it was great. They were great. Did you end up investing? - I did, yeah. - How much? Uh, man, by the end, I guess it was about ten. "About" ten? Ten. It was the full $10,000. - Wow. - Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing we talked about it, though, - 'cause we had to-- - Yeah, yeah, no. Yeah. - So did everybody-- - What is it? Hold on. Did everybody end up investing $10,000? Um, oh, man, I don't actually know. What? They weren't really talking that much about money. They just said, "we're good with investing," and-- and I-- Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble. They said they were done with the investing, and then you volunteered $10,000? -  Ooh, ooh  - No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam. So you invested $10,000 to look like a team player? - You weren't there. -  And I'll be  It was very clear that $10,000 was what we had-- - We'll talk about it later. - No, I want to - talk about it now. - Pam. Jim, that was most of our savings.  And I'll be better when I'm older   I'll be the greatest fan of your life  Wait. Wait, hold on. Where's the band? 'Cause there's no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths. That's what she said. What, am I overdoing it? No. No.  That color them wonderful stop me  - We said "some." - We'll talk about it. - We said "some." - We'll talk about it later.  Steal my breath  We said "part," not "all."  And I'll be   your crying shoulder   Fill up and you don't have to pay   bah dah bah   come on and give us a play   get a wash right away  -  car wash, yeah  - Yes! - Oh, man. - That's how you do that! - Whoo! - Thank you. Show some pride. This is crap. I agree, yes. Crap. Continue. Now, folks, by special request, we're going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room. Who? It's Mr. Andy Bernard! No, do not sing that. Do not-- oh, man. He reminded us today of how much he means to us, and we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here's an old Treble classic.  Ah, ah, ah   dank, dank, dank, dank, dank   dig-a, dank, dank, dank   a-well, I guess it would be nice   if I could touch your body   I know not everybody has got a body like you  -  but I gotta think twice  - Whoa! Whoa!  Before I give my heart away  What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here? She said you wanted to hear Faith. That's Broccoli Rob's signature song.  Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion  That's my signature song. I really didn't know that, man. I just thought you wanted to hear it. Russell, I'm dressed like George Michael. I thought you were Adam Lambert. Wha-- The more I hear about all this a cappella drama, the more I think it's kind of pathetic, but when you're with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love. Are you okay? - He's still mad. - Okay. Shut up, Broccoli. Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up, and they said they needed so just wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number. You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man's signature solo is his for life. Okay? That's group policy and you know it. Look, it's not my fault I still live near campus, and it's my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys, and stop in two, three times a week. Just don't do the song anymore. I'll tell you what We'll have a sing-off for it. You pick 12 alums from any year to back you up and I'll do the same, and I'm so confident that I'll win, I won't even warm up. Fine, go ahead, thrash your pipes. My pipes are primo, Champ! Why don't you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes? I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch! He said, and I quote, "hey, Rob, nice pipes." - That happened! - Okay, fine, yeah, - that's one guy's opinion. - That's real! - That'll never change! - Okay! Okay, doesn't mean you're the best singer ever! Dick. I thought that concert was pretty great. Oh, yeah. I decided acapelca music is awesome. They lost me when they sang Monster Mash. That song obviously glorifies the occult. Angela, it's Halloween. You have to sing Monster Mash. Oh, you have to, Jim? You literally have to? Uh No, I'm just-- I'm saying, what would happen if they didn't sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot? Okay. We'll just forget it. - No, no, I'm interested. - Mm-hmm. I mean, I think everybody's interested in why they have to sing it. - 'Cause it is Halloween. - Mm-hmm. So if you're gonna sing a concert, it's a good idea to throw that one in. Yeah, yeah, no, no, it's a good idea to brush your teeth, but you have to, um, feed your children, send them to school. You know, all things you can't do if you just keep singing Monster Mash. It turns out Pam really, really hates Monster Mash. I mean, like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, "no. Hate it. Stupid." This is all so silly, right? What am I gonna do, move back to Cornell? Yeah. I mean, what if we did that? Like, we got jobs and we were happy all the time? Oh, well, Andy, we're not moving to Cornell. Duh, I know. - That would be insane. - Yeah. It could totally work, though. I don't know why we wouldn't. Oh, my God, are we doing this? Oy. Andy, what is going on? If I am not Boner Champ I don't know who I am. Well, you know, maybe you're the wise, old guy that the new, um, B-O-N-E-R Champ looks up to. You know, you could just-- Make a donation. Well, I was gonna say be a mentor. Yes. I'm gonna make a donation. And it just so happens I know someone who works at the Bernard family foundation. - Her name is "mom." - Oh. I want some of those pills. Oh. Well, good for you. I mean, you'll need a prescription. Oh, no. No, no, no, they're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless and a high-pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. - Other cousin Mose. - Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he's a good man and I hope he feels better. Which one? Mose or the real Mose? The real Mose. He says thank you. Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up a scholarship for a cappella kids at Cornell, and just need to wire some money over there. What?  Far above the busy humming   of the bustling town   reared against the arch of heaven looks she proudly down  What's wrong? My parents are broke.  Lift the chorus, speed it onward   loud her praises tell   hail to thee, our alma mater   hail, all hail, Cornell
Can you guys come with me for a minute? I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So, yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity, and discretion. Why? All right, good. Yeah, just sell it and get the best price you can, okay? Or we can hope for a holiday rally? Mike, I'm not a day trader. I'm just a first responder in a disaster. Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman. And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar. The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him, and the way he's been handling it is just so-- - Competent. - Right? Are the nards hurtin'? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But I'm kinda crushin' it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course, he caused this whole mess, so fuck him. Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible manner. So I need your help in keeping it a secret, because this means the world to me. Okay? That's beautiful. No, I-I totally get that. Can you do this, Kevin? I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that. I don't know what that means. Hey, hey. Oh, great. Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. Hey, guys, has anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio? Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura show. Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Bizwhiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? "Uh, yeah, wow. at only $6.90 after discount? Uh, whatever you say, Brad Pitt." It's that easy. Hey, so that good-looking single brother of yours? Heard he was in a downward spiral with booze. Yeah. He's in rehab, actually. Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour. No, it's in New Mexico. Oh. So, how are you holding up? We're done, Meredith. Greta the tittle-tattle prattled on about the little metal bottle. - Oh, my God. - She spat a bit of spittle-- - Dwight. In a bitter battle-- Hey, hey. Stop questioning my methods, okay? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason. No. You chose yourself. Tricky Siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit-- All right, guys, there's a lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat, a 43-foot Tartan sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas. The sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom. - Sounds great. - Perfect. Totally, except it is a no-go. This boat was the heart and soul of our family. So what else we got? Non-boat ideas. - What happened? - Jammed. - Excuse me a second. - Could this day get worse? Yeah, I think this day could get worse. - What does that mean? - Kevin. I don't know what you're talking about. She could get, like, for 5 bucks. - Oh, hey, sorry. - She could eat for a month. All right, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut? If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months. Guys, you don't understand. This boat's been in our family since before I was born. Yeah, don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories? - I worked at a Jiffy Lube. - See? I bet you wouldn't sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world, would you, Darryl? I would if I owned it and I went broke. All right. Uh, all right. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat. Yes, the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it? Excuse me. Oh, okay. No problem. Thanks. Hey, guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the steamtown mall, and Iris wants to cover that, so Well, why don't I go and tell Dwight, so he can stop being such a complete nipple? He's gonna be disappointed. Yes, he is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen. Fax? Oh, yeah. Just-- just a minute. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone, but it's a girlfriend's job to know her man, and I know Andy. He is seriously juvenile. Cool. He's, like, 40, though, right? Oh, no. He couldn't be more than late 30s, tops. Awesome. Have fun. Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good, sounds-- This is Dwight Schrute. Please hold for Ms. Black. And welcome back to Bizwhiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line, we have Dunder Mifflin senior sales associate Dwight Schrute. Iris, thank you so much for having me. Help! My teeth are all messed up in my mouth. Did you need something? Oh, I just need your signature on this. Okay. Thanks. Kevin, we're out of 1138 forms. Did you order more? I did not. Well, I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you could do could surprise me anymore. Oh, really, Angela? That's interesting. 'Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you all the-- Ah! I have to go to the bathroom. That doesn't surprise me. That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room, shouting that he has to go to the bathroom. Oh! I have to go to the bathroom! I have to go to the bathroom! Okay, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend? Look, it's not that I don't want-- Okay, come on, I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert, perfect. All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. He said, "you can't be a skipper until you're a man." You know, I'd reach for the wheel, and he'd just smack my hand away. Well, guess what. Now I'm the man of the family, and we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance. Well, when does the boat leave, exactly? Tonight. Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail. Yeah, right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We'd have to leave, like, right now. Okay, well, then let's leave, like, right now. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Let's go. Seriously? Of course seriously. Get your coat on. - All right. - All right. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. Iris, let me tell you, David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands-on. So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command? Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris. Uh, excuse me, I'm being told by my sound engineer Steve that, uh, there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons? Yes. I'm so sorry, we are going to have to ask you to remove the shirt altogether. Now then. We were saying, when my workers gather-- Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems, Mr. Schrute. Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine. That's impossible. Are you, by any chance, wearing pants with a metallic zipper? The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out. It's a tough one. That man he's up against is so dirty, and the Senator's just pushing back as hard as he can. Please stop. What? Please stop. Anyways, last night, he was so tired, he just wanted a little Mexican brought in. I can't. It's-- it's too much. I'm in big trouble. Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble. Okay, how is my voice now? I'm getting the all clear from Steve. So, Mr. Schrute, what is your response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic? This is gotcha journalism. But you know what? They're not gonna "gotch" me. It's clearly not an accounting mistake. - Oh, Kevin. - So His gambling problem must have resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation. Well, you gotta do what you gotta do, so This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander, I say. I dare you to produce one credible source about this. Well, as it happens, we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sondra Mc-- Sondra Mick. Good afternoon, Iris. It's a pleasure. I'll get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic? No, the paper's not toxic Thank you, Sondra! Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic. Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled. What the heck is going on? The stock price is plummeting. Are you gonna get control of the message, or do I have to send in someone who understands the media? - Get out of here, moron! - Okay. Uh, excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to? Uh, no one. Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron? No, everything's fine. Are you insulting my guests? Okay. I will be right there. Hey, Oscar. What if I'm getting a promotion? I hope that's it, Kevin. Me too. 'Cause then, I would get my own office, and I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that. Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you-- - Hi. - Guys, excuse me. Um, a quick word? Please, just-- - Oscar, we're in the middle of talking. I know. I'm so sorry. Snack machine, on me. Oh, that is nice. Classy move. That's what I'm saying! No, of course not! - Wha-- - What are you doing? Those figures I gave you, they're false. No. I was mad at Kevin. We had a fight, and I acted vindictively. So you set him up. Yes, he's innocent. Oh I knew it. I knew it from the beginning, this was a possibility. What are you talking about? I just did this now. Oh, no, a few years ago, when I was on the jury, the Scranton strangler. Sure. I always thought he might have been set up, but I felt pressured to convict. That's gotta be tough. Tough? I put an innocent man on death row. The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount. Since Mr. Dwight Schrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Schrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time? My resignation? What are you talking about? No, I'm just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the ceo and chairman, David Wallace. That's yours? That's the family boat right there. Oh, my gosh, Andy. This is enormous. Right? I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh, my gosh. It's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America. - Move. - Sorry? I'm trying to rig a boat here. I don't know how to do that when you're standing in the way. Sure, I-I'm not-- I didn't know. I'm not a ghost, so I can't walk through people. - Okay. - Okay. - He was salty. - Yes, a little bit. How you doing, old buddy? Missed you. What does that one do? This raises the mainsail. That was my job when we went sailing. I wish I had seen you do it. - Really? - Yeah. Up she goes. Don't do that. - Don't do that. - Oh, it's okay. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me. Nope. Can't do that. Got it. You know what, then we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. We've already started boarding. No one is insured to rig or operate now, except us. You know what? Chill, okay? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. All right? So just-- Wow. I can smack you all day if you keep touching what you're not supposed to touch. - Okay, fine, fine. - Okay? - Yeah, fine. - Good stuff. Good stuff. Great stuff. Fuck! Damn it! Screw you, dad! Ugh! Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat. I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it. Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man. Fine, but I could have. As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain. I am the captain. - Yeah. - Right? Yeah. I'm the captain. Hey, charm school. What? - I'm taking over from here. - Nice. Okay, I hate to ruin this, uh, moment, or breakdown, but you already signed the papers. So, if you want your boat back, you can pick it up there in the Bahamas in ten days. Yeah, I know, 'cause I'm sailing it there. Okay, no. I already said you're not getting back your deposit. Fine, keep it. Just leave the supplies. I already paid for those. And how much for that cool fisherman sweater? For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich, where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet, and has taken a mailman hostage. On the line, we have Chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson. Good afternoon. Please, sir, spare him. Please. Uh, this Wallace guy's looking at hard time, and we only know this because of what Dwight snoot said on record. Okay, everyone. Everyone, hold on. I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number. Everyone hold, I'll conference him in. Oh, no, Mr. Schrute, there's really no need to, um, involve Mr. Wallace. Do you even know what you're doing? Yeah. Yeah, I know how to hoist the mainsail, I know how to-- These buttons control bilge pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. Hello. Walt? Oh, God! Thank goodness you're here. I was having a little trouble, uh, with this door, uh, yesterday. I, um-- I think it was yesterday. I thought you were in rehab. Yeah, I just, uh-- I figured I'd get that first relapse out of the way. God, what's happened to our family? Everything is so messed up. How did you even know I was in here? I didn't. I just came to say good-bye to the boat, but I've decided to sail it to Bermuda. - Bahamas, Andy. - Same thing. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it. We need this. Serious bro time. Come on. - Hello? - David, is that you? Dwight? Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Are you okay? Is everyone okay? Yeah. Are you okay? I'm okay. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David. Well, thanks, Dwight. You're welcome, sir. But, David, listen to me carefully. I'm going to need you to let the mailman go, okay? Dwight? - Walk out of the house - What? With your hands on top of your head. Everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison. Okay, Dwight? Gonna ask you to not call me on my cell anymore. Gotta go. Wait a minute. You guys? You heard? Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Schrute! Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected. Well, Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information. Well, I'm sorry, Kevin. Why on Earth would you think you were getting a promotion? You know what, Angela, I-- Oh, my God. Honey, what are you doing here? Oh, I just had an intuition that someone I love needed a little of my attention today. Oscar, looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise? No. No. Oscar, what is going on? What was that? - Wha-- - What was that? I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly. You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted, because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Come on, Oscar. We're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, thanks, everybody. 'Cause it's really cool. - USA! USA! - USA. U-- I have to say, I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control. I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. Oscar is having sex with the Senator, and Angela doesn't even know. Her life is a complete sham. All right, guys. Cast us off. Walt, all aboard. Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever. Oh, you know, just being a good girlfriend. "Good"? Come on. Above and beyond. World's greatest. You did this. Damn it, I'm happy! Yes, I am very pleased I could help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes, I think that would have been really fun and romantic. - I'll see you in three weeks! - Okay! Hey, bro, it was here all along. - No way! - Way! Erin, I gotta go! Them's my chords! Hey. She's back. Thanks for covering the phones. Yeah, no problem. How was it? Fine. Hey, some buddies and I are going to poor Richard's for beers and pool. You want to come? I can't promise you too much, but you might get to meet my friend Flipper. Does he have a flipper? Oh, nope. It's not that. He, uh, he flipped a table one time when he was drunk. He sounds like an idiot. Yeah, he is. - Okay. - Okay. Thanks. Yeah.
Uh what else? I've seen Dirty Dancing like 10 times. Breaks my heart every time, you know? - Whoa. - Andy. That Swayze sure can dance dirty. Don't you have any sunblock? No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They're like two flaming meatballs in my skull. Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family's boat, and he took his brother but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song-- No, Woman. No Cry. Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That's what I call the sun now. Andy, it's Darryl. Take your drawers off your head. What else can I show you? Oh, damn it! Oh, Andy, was-- was that your drinking water? Yeah, it was. That's okay, though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up seawater through this hose and pumps out freshwater. See, check it out. Ow! - Oh! - Oh, no. Ah. That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean, these Skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? He's been sailing for two days. I will leave you with this, the image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains. Yeah. No, no. No! No! - Oh! - Oh, my God. Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh. Dwight Schrute. Well, hi, there, David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager's out of town? Well, I have some very exciting news. And you didn't call Jim. That seems significant. - Hey, David. - Jim, good. - You should hear this too. - Uh, no, he shouldn't. Wha-- Ji-- Go ahead, David. I'm listening. No-- I-- okay, David, I'm gonna take you off speaker, but I don't know where I'd put you. Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office. They have apparently dropped their supplier for the last ten years. The White Pages. The White Pages. Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There is a reason we in the paper industry call this thing "the white whale." Look at all that sweet blubber. Look, we need our top salesman running point on this, and, Dwight, that is you. I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. Ha! Yeah! Whoo! Eat it, Jim! Eat it, Phyllis! Eat-- - Where's Stanley? - He's in the bathroom. Will you run to the bathroom and tell him to eat it? Of course. Yeah! Okay. Hey, David. I'm back. Eat it, Stanley! So, uh, last I remember, Tom Peterman was in charge of that account. No, my assistant spoke to the receptionist over there. It's someone new, but she didn't catch her name. "Her" name? No. Hey, Dwight shouldn't-- Thanks, David. Thank you so much for calling me today. - Good luck. - Good luck to you. Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them. That is a damnable lie. I love women. Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her "gy-na" for your entire meeting. Ew. That's not good. Yeah. She said she corrected him five times. Gy-na said that? Guys, we can't let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses Pizza Friday could come back. Hey, remember that week in the '90s when we got bagels? I miss Clinton. - Can you go instead? - I can't. I have the thing. I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I'm helping start-- first board meeting, also the first time I've ever been excited about work, so that feels wrong. Okay, calm down. It's just me, not Tom Selleck. Nice. Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It's a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money, and then you grow a mustache for the month of November. So this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time. Damn! It just keeps on coming, huh? I have very fertile hair glands. I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex. God! We even go to lunch, pick up babes. Smile if you love men's prostates. - Hi. - Hi. Spring cleaning? More like fall cleaning. I think the Senator is having an affair. This doesn't-- I'm sorry. Wha-- what? I think the Senator is having an affair. I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela's husband spoon me back to bed. When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile. Oh, I'm sure that's nothing. And he's always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class. It's hot yoga with Blake. Angela, Blake's also a guy's name, so he may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake? I don't know. I just never heard about the Senator and yoga - Right. - from you. I'm sure it's probably nothing. But what's with the yoga already? - Right? - And Blake. - Right? - All right, Angela, calm down. Okay. We need to go and check this out. - What? - Angela, I'll go with you. So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client. Okay. With pleasure. Time to learn a few new tricks, old dog. - You got this, Schrute. - Okay. You just walked into her office and begin. - Hello. - Hello. May I please speak to your boss? - No, she is the boss. - I am? Yes. Hi. I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you? Okay, this isn't working for me, 'cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss. He's absolutely right. I'm really struggling here. Oh, I'll be the buyer. Okay. Hello, Mr. Schrute. Nice to see you. Please have a seat. I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive, imposing. I am going to sell to you in 12 minutes. No, actually, she'd like to take her time discussing her needs. I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. This is gonna work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over. Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts? I thought it went great. I have, uh, written down a few questions. One. Have you ever killed a woman? How many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me? Okay, let's get started. Okay, cool. We're all on? Uh, well, you're the only one on. We're all here. Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months - That's the winter season. - I, uh-- Three months. I, uh I had some ideas, actually. Are you in your office right now? Yeah. Trust me, I'd rather be with you guys. Okay. Yeah, it's sounding kind of spooky-sexy over here, Halpert. Oh. Sorry. I-I, uh-- I was saying that you should probably just call me-- Whoa. That's-- I think there's, uh-- I think there's been a mistake. We're trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman. Um, you know what? I should've just had-- I should've just had you call me on my cell. I'll-- I'm gonna try a different spot, okay? - Okay. Yeah. - I'll call you right back. What's happening in three months? Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also, you want to respect their Are you listening now? Yes. Okay, well, you have to show us. That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation, but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all. Huh. Uh-huh. What are you doing? A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. - Got it? - Kind of. Nellie, why don't you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today, and, Dwight, you show us that you're listening. Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing the mural that I've commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking about the color schemes and the major themes we want to hit-- children of the world coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way. It's just up and down Just a regular nod, like a person. I am a person. - Yes. - Of course. You're a person. - Yeah. - We can do this, all right? And then we thought we'd I can't. I just-- I can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean, he looks like he's laboring over a stool, having just eaten human flesh. That's a bit extreme. I'm s-- I'm sorry, but that is true. He's screwed. The meeting's in less than an hour. Oh, all right. God, Dwight. Uh, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage, okay? You're the woman. I'm the salesman. Watch what I do and try to learn. Okay, I'm the woman. I'm a woman. Good? - Okay. - No. Miss Thomas, so good to see you. Hello. Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute. They could be models. Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina. - Boo. Weird. - No. Okay, well, this is a lost cause. He's hopeless. Ten years ago, I didn't care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I'm like, "that poor gimp is somebody's child." You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women. Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their-- their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders. Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who's a nice, reasonable person in your experience? I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently. Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine she's that nice, reasonable barber. - Okay, I can do that. - Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps. He used to fight dogs. Like, he used to make dogs fight, or he actually fought dogs? Little of this, little of that. Which one is the instructor? They're all fatties. Angela, Angela. What? Where? - Stairs, the stairs. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her. Oh, my God. She's so stunningly tiny. She's like a petite double zero for sure, for sure. Holy cow, look at what they're doing. She's repositioning his hips for downward-facing dog. I've heard of this-- dog style. Oh, wait. Oh, look, Oscar. Thumbelina has a boyfriend. And he has a ponytail? Ew. I'd like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let's go. Let's go. - No, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Ow. Shut up. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Shh. Just-- sorry. Look. Oh. - This is fun. - Oh-- - you know? This is fun. What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in-- Uh - It was what? - Sorry, um Jim, we're having a lot of trouble hearing you. The-- the-- the-- what I was saying is the real genius was-- Hey! Are those skateboarders back? - Jim? Jim, are you there? - Where are they? - It was, uh - Little punks. It was in the authentic design, right? So, I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan - was wearing these shoes-- - Jim! - Who was messing with my van? - Nobody! - Jordan wore them for nobody? - No, no, no We're not following you, Halpert. This ends now! Have a seat. Um, she will be right in. Oh, great. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don't have it. - Uh, she'll be right in. - Okay, great. She-- okay. Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah. Just comb it. Oh, my God. It's Jan. Oh, dear God in heaven. Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met. You son of a bitch. - You're firing me? - I'm in an interview. Where the hell do you get off? Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that? Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It's so great to see you! - Where's Wallace? - What? I was under the impression David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct? Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble-bath model. I could just bite her head off. Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead. Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont. Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant. And I guess it did get a little confusing 'cause you said not to tell anyone your name. And then also, these bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, - but Tom never had us use them-- - Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan. I'm so sorry, Jan. Anyway I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with, uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing? Listening. - Stop. Stop that. - Sorry. Okay. So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give? No, I-I do. But not to us. Insightful, Pam. You did good, Dwight. It's okay. Seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not gonna sell to us. Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back. What? - Pam. - Yeah. - I'm a very busy woman, so - Yeah, um Do you have any other pictures of Astrid? Fine. I will show you one slideshow. - Erin, did this call-- - Uh! Sorry. I just-- I saw your face. Oh. I'm sorry. It's for the thing. I know. That's great. It just-- it makes it look like there's an eyebrow in the middle of your face. Wow. A handsome eyebrow, but, um It makes your mouth look like an eye socket, - which isn't bad. - Uh-huh. But, um, you look like a cyclops whose eye fell out which is great. It's such a great cause. Yeah.  Mommy, you're a princess   mommy, you're a superstar   mommy, you're the greatest   how can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?  Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever. Aw. And it is so cute how she signs her name. Well, that-- that was-- that was me too. Oh, okay. It's just that's how Cece does it with the backwards Es. - Cece can't spell her name. - Oh, actually, she can. Well, it's not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, "Cece" is two letters, and "Astrid" is I mean, there's even some adults who-- who-- who can't spell it. - Of course. - Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam. Um A X? I don't-- you got me. Don't patronize me. I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better. Okay, we should go now. Let's go. Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. - Wait. Why are you-- Oh, are you getting your jollies right now? Can't get enough of the show? - Your jollies are all on fire-- - Please. It's Robert who's enjoying it. What? This could be the affair that you're scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. But, uh, he's probably not gay. He's straight. He's straight, so Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water? No. Jan You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well, I've got one. Man-boy! The ace of babes. Oh, my God. Where's the quiznos? You're the quiznos. Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs-- Nothing like, uh, your old assistant Hunter. Was that his name? - I-I-- - Hmm? I don't recall. And, yes, Molly is crap. Okay, you do not have to do this. Do what? Get into sales? That's what I want. He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do so young. Will you, uh You. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight, you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business. Very good. Do you have a valid passport? - Jim Halpert. - Hey, it's Colin. Hey, man. I am so sorry about that. I know. Don't worry about it. It's just-- it's not totally working. Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing-- not ideal. But don't worry. I'll figure it out. Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this. Uh, what does-- what does that mean? Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the Senator might be gay? I don't know, Angela. I'm dehydrated. Maybe you heard me wrong. We should just go. Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. - What is he doing? - He's making a phone call. Oh, oh! Oh, hey, Molly. Um, you should just quit. - Yeah. Thanks. - Yeah. Okay. Oh, and, uh, Molly I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings. Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number. Oh, I got her number. - That's a license number? - That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know. Oh. Why me? Because you are my friend and you are a woman and women love gossip, it's like  you people. Ugh, God.
Yesterday Angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual. Good morning. Oscar Can I ask you a question? Of course, ask me a que-- questions. Is it cool in here to you? Yes, a little bit. Yes. I think the thermostat is acting up again. It's the stupid thermostat! That thing's a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs. - Thank you. - No, thank you, Angela. She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way, I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love. Well, well, well, it's finally happened-- Pam has ceased caring. These are my painting clothes. I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. Sure you don't want to put another coat of primer on that, Pam? Queen of the primer, that one. You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started? Are you avoiding your phone call? What? No. Yeah, right. As if. Today, I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there. Last week, Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead. I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace. Tell them your opening line. Hey, David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia? I think it's good. He likes fishing. This is gonna be awful. One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they're in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information's already on the computer, so why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to "chillax," and then went away on a big long boat ride. So here we are. Don't give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. Fight the power. Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you. Ugh. Come on in, the water's fine. Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on. I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes. Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. - Ugh. - Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband? My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me. All right, what are we talking? - Surveillance, wire-tapping? - Something like that. Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force. - Can you arrange a meeting? - I can try. - I'm gonna use SMS text. - Okay. - Text went through. - Okay. All we can do is sit and wait. Okay. Oh. Look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem. I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly. Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there's a crisis-- the more I think about it-- Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agreed to cover for me - while I'm gone. - They did? Yep. Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- maybe this can work. Oh, great. Why should we help you? Because we're friends. When is my birthday? Unfair. When's my birthday? I don't know, because we're not friends. How about this-- you let me take you to lunch, and I make my case? - Now we're talkin'. - All right. Yeah. Make it go taller. That's the idea. No, not taller this way, taller this way. Well, I've gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher. You're not getting this, Peter. Make it go wider up! Will do. What are y'all doing? Me and Pete are building a tower. Cool. It should be taller, though, right? Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl, but he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer. Kevin, I can hear you. Huh? Ow! Dwight! Ow! - Get in the van. - God! Is it safe to talk? Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good. So what are your credentials? I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out I'm damn good at it. Do you have a gun? Does he own a gun? Show her. You tell me. What is this? It's the receipt for my gun. You don't carry it with you? Read the receipt. That's a $300 gun. Someone could steal it. Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him? Now I keep it in a safe. - Mm-hmm. Good safe? - Oh, you tell me. Wow! I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It's just I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So I'm gonna limit myself to one shrub. You paint wall now? Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that You paint now. It's probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing. I wait. - Sweet. - Yay! This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote, "sausage factory." Oh-ooooh! - Boom! - Bang! - Yep, yep, yep. - All right. Up next we got a whole lotta creed. - Let's find out what I did. - All right. You get half now, and you get half upon completion of said job. - And that's all off the books? - Obviously. Nice. No taxes. Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here. So what's the job? Murder. Okay, that's the big one. That's the big M. You can't have someone murdered! What if they deserved it? What did they do to you, Angela? They're sleeping with my husband. Oh, monkey. Oh, I feel for you. - This seems a little crazy. - Yes. Crazy. - Thank you. - But I think I'm up for it. - No! No! - Thank you. Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch-- That's very effective. I've been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. - It's devastating. - No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer. What about a knee-capping? No! You're not helping, Trevor! Yes, a knee-capping could work. No. Angela! What are you saying? You said you would be there for me. I'm trying, but what you're asking is-- It's the only thing that will make this right. Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn. All right, then it's settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4:00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there's no turning back. You know, truth be told, I think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I'm gone. We've got all afternoon to talk about that. - Morning, folks. - I'll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster. Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob-- Not enough lobster. Side order. How much wine do you have? I brought you a cookie. Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel. I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so yeah, we're good. Yeah. We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- well, I gotta go now, but-- okay, bye. Bye. There we go. Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex. Ooohh you salty dog. Well, yeah, what can I say, a player's gotta play. There you go. Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I'm gonna let them think the other thing. - Okay, I got this one. - Oh, be careful. - Be careful, be careful. - No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath. Kevin! What did I say? What did I just say? Hey, hey, hey, it's just a mistake. Just a mistake. That's what this tower's all about-- mistakes. Okay, if you're afraid of screwing up, the tower's not for you. Show of hands-- who here has never had a complaint? That's right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let's get back to work, huh? Come on, you in? Yeah. There we go. All right, let's do it. You know, at the end of the day it's really only two days, remember. I mean, I'll be back in the office. If you need me for an emergency, call me. - I'll be there-- - You know what? I don't know where the years went. 'Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them. - Tell me about it. - Whose hands are these? They're not my hands. I don't know. All right. You know what? - Maybe we'll just-- - Uhh-- - We'll go slow. - No. Jim All right, check it out, huh? Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh! Nice. Pretty soon, we're gonna be at the ceiling. - Whoo! - Can you hand me a card? Um, it's empty. - What? - Oh, come on. We could use a blank card. - No! - That's cheating. I could get us a complaint. You? Little miss priss? You wouldn't fart on a butterfly. No, I wouldn't. I can't even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I'd like to try. - Hmm. Yeah. - All right. Yeah, go, Pam! Pam What? Why did you call me out here? The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other. I don't know what you're talking about. Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils. Fine! It's Oscar. So what? Well, I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- dare I say a friend? Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband. I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me. Well, you might be right, but it's too late now. - What do you mean? - He's here. No! No, no! Oscar. Oscar. Good. Listen. - Hey, come with me. - What? - Come-- come with me. - What are you doing? There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary. Yahtzee. Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez. I am Oscar Martinez. No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside. Wha-wh-- You know, there's doughnuts in the break room. - Nice! - Yeah. Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over. Don't be pushy, Jim. It's tacky. All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that's-- that's decorative. No, there's wine in here. - Still decorative. - Is it white wine? No. Maybe stop with the-- Don't poke people with knives. - Ha ha! - Phyllis! Wow. - Bring it over. - Got it. There's no time to explain. Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your kneecaps. Oh, my God! What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about. Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us. Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us. Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this. No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder Mifflin man. He's my tribe. I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- - Stop! No! - I got it. - Disarm! - You don't-- Don't move. And disarm now! Okay. Okay, okay No, Oscar, no. No, he's a friend. He's a friend. Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They're family-owned, but don't let that take away your edge! Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you. Remember, you're a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this. Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, "hey, kool-aid." Yeah, your mama's fat. This is Pam Halpert. - Did she buy it? - Did they say anything? I don't know. I couldn't tell. I don't-- Were they angry? I-- I felt like they were confused, at least. Okay. Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client! Nice. Nice. - You did good. You did good. - See ya later, Heymont. - No. - Oh. Oh If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me, I will bite so hard. - Got it? Good-bye, my friend. - What the hell, Dwight? - I'll see you later, Trevor. You are incorrigible! I just saved your life. You're welcome! You hired someone to hit me with a pipe! You deserved every bit of it! You made my husband gay. What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is gay. He was gay when you married him! - No. No. - Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead-- I won't stop you. Hit me. You have my blessing. Hit me. Well, are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you. Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe. - God! - Aah! You were supposed to be my friend. - I'm so sorry. Angela-- - Oscar. Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert For insulting a client's recently deceased mother. - Yes! - I did not know that. Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life. - I'm so sorry. - Wow. Yeah, that's-- that is terrible. - You did it. - Yeah! I feel so stupid I sit next to him every day. You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid. Jazz is stupid! I mean, just play the right notes! I know. You're gonna be okay, monkey. I don't like your friend Trevor. I don't like him either. And yet, I really like him. Well, we're here. Perfect. We're gonna cover for you, you know. Phyllis, what was that? Phyllis, are you dreaming, or-- - I did enjoy grinding your beans, son. Yeah, we really did peel your grapes. This is hilarious, but we're gonna stop with all-- - Shuckin' your peas. - Shuckin' the peas. You should go back to the first part, though. You are gonna cover for me? - Yeah. - Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys. Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you. If you're an artist, you have to be okay with the idea that you can't please everybody all the time. - You paint very bad-- - Shut up, Hide! I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh, my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I'm okay with that. Where does gayness come from, and how is it transmitted? That is-- that is a loaded question. My pastor said it can come from breast feeding. He said that? Well, he didn't fight me hard on it. I-- I don't know if there's truth to-- to, uh, that. What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet? Oh uh - Is it called red-vining? - Is it called red-vining? I-- I don't-- We heard it was called red-vining. People red-vine. Where are gay men's vaginas? They don't have vaginas. What? No. They're just regular men. When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person's penis? Uh wow.
I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes. I'm sure it's fine. It's a blue shirt. Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness? I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking. Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-whatever. So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"? Philadelphia. From the Greek philia, meaning "love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "The city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise. And don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle. Oh Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas, everyone! - No. - Is it? - I mean, it says "X-mas party," but I think we all know what that's code for. So we're not gonna have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us? Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee. Well, you are the one in charge of it. Don't blame me for something we all forgot. Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot. I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points. I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works. We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party! Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor - and those mini-cupcakes? - Mini-cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people? What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with Saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel. Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement? - No. - No! - Done, right? - No. I want tropical Christmas. - Topless Christmas. - Tapas Swiss miss! Spanish tapas and Swiss miss hot cocoa-- what's so hard to understand? Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular. - We already said no. - No, no, no. Too weird. This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, Matrix style. I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy? Party planning committee, emergency meeting. Now. - I'm on it. - Right. I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses. Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think-- I think you mean John McCain. Die Hard reference. - I haven't seen it. - You haven't seen Die Hard? - Mm-mmm. - Why haven't you seen Die Hard? I don't know, I just haven't. Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it. No. "Now, I have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho." "Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs." None of this makes any sense to me! Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, "yippie-ki-yay, mother--" Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans. Yes, you are right. Forgive me. - Oh, that's okay, bud. - Nope. - Common mistake. - No, it's not. Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie? My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and I loved doing it. Okay, let's hear it. - Hear what? - Die Hard. Every line. Go. You don't like flying, do you? Don't change the subject. No, that's the-- Movie is starting. We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work. I love Philly. Dirty town. Ah-ha-ha! Philly! - Exciting stuff, man. - Whoo! So you sure you remembered everything for your trip? - Yeah, I think so. - Think that through for a sec. Yeah, Jim's going to Philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right? What else could you possibly be forgetting? - Uh-- - Things? People? You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, AKA the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison for something he may not have done. I'm sorry, the-- uh, the Scranton who? The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago? Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand. I-- I could-- I could talk about it. See you next Christmas. I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back. We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And, if it's great I think we all know what that would mean to us. Let's do it. Yes. Phyllis! No. I don't want my name attached to this party. What does that even mean? Where would your name appear? Please just take my name off of everything. Just take her name off of everything. The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas. Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas miracle! Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! - Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously. - Uh-huh. - And that is Uh-oh. That there are no rules. You have never been cooler. Best Christmas ever. - You're welcome. - Thank you. And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun. Ugh. What is this stuff, lava? That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. - Enjoy. - What is it? Don't touch it. - Somebody's found the hog maw. - Oh! What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it. Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat. It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib. - Can't wait. - Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine? This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a shepherd's crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces. How would anyone even know-- Have you ever tasted a shepherd's crook? I don't know. Is it what you expected? I feel like-- Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem. So happy right now. Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump. I wish my car had a bathroom. "Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. - After that--" - Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete. That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes. I don't know. This looks pretty legit. Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land. "What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw Life of Pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see Hobbit. Lates." Hey. Everything okay? So what comes next? Right, um, okay. So he says, "after we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--" We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense. Or we can just sit and talk, though. No. No more talking. It's movie time. I mean, are you sure Yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car. Oh, great. Great! So we're watching Die Hard, now. Good! This is a good plan. Okay. Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight. I love this hog mama. Dwight said it's "hog maw." What is maw? It's the lining of the stomach of-- Ohh Judgment is nigh, for the Belsnickel ist I! Yes, he is finally nigh. I am nigh! Every year, my grandfather would dress up as Belsnickel at Christmas. He was okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be Belsnickel. Ohh, Belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Ohh too much strudel. So he's kind of like Santa, except dirty and worse. No, much better-- no one fears Santa the way they fear Belsnickel. Wow. It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority. - And the fear. - Yes, exactly! Come on, Dwight, you're making this up. - No - This is a real thing. "Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of St. Nicholas in the folklore of Southwestern Germany." - Ah. - Wow. Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some Democrat looks it up on Wikipedia? "His partner, Zwarte Piet, or Black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface." Uh-uh. No, Dwight. No. Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. - Isn't that crazy? - Mm. Jim, that guy. You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? It's awful. Take a bowl and pass it down. Thank you, Dwight. These are nice. No, these are gift bowls. When you receive a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The Belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable. Oh, it's like naughty or nice. No, impish or admirable. Quick question-- do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list? - I decided earlier. - Oh. Nice. - Did you check that list? - Of course I checked it. But more than once? 'Cause you could have made a mistake. - I checked it more than once. - Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's-- Impish or admirable. Damn. Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here. I judge your year as admirable. There you are. Oh. What are these? It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars. - I'd rather have the bowl. - You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here. I judge your year as impish! Ow! You hit people with that thing? No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder. Ooh. Mouse trap. In a head-to-head contest, people prefer Belsnickel over Santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. It was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel. Oh, you know what? - I gotta go. - Stop giggling. Oh, really? Already? - Yeah, it's all right. - It's a punishment. Hey, where are you going? I have to go to Philly. But this was amazing. - Okay? - But you work tomorrow. Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep. But we were gonna break the pig rib. - Ohh. - Remember? That's right. No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this-- off with you! Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present? You know what? Yeah. Have at it. Jim Halpert, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here. I judge your year as impish. Ohh! Are you nuts? - I judge you impish! - Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard. They're not abandoning the party. Just-- just-- hey! That's enough, I'm done! - Okay? Agh! - Impish! Aah! Ow! Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. Oh what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. One second. - Oh - Well this is it. I'm probably never gonna see you again. Shut up. I'm trying to be serious. Okay, sorry, sorry. I can't believe this is actually happening. Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck? Okay. Good luck. You're gonna be great. I'll call you when I get in. - Okay. - All right. - Love you. - Love you. - What's going on? - Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! We found some old decorations on the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in It's a Wonderful Life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all those people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero. Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it! Oh, it sounds like the party's - starting up out there. - Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting. Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing. Boo! For what it's worth, I liked your party better. Everyone thought the food was gross, and that Belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak. I don't think anyone thought that. Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party. Well, that didn't have anything to do with you. I don't care. Guess how much I care - on a scale of one to ten. - Zero. Damn it! I'm gonna tell Jim to go fuck himself. Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me? Yeah. Definitely. Hey, what's-- oh, no, come here. Hey, hey. Come on, huh? I'm still Andy's girlfriend. Oh, yeah, of course. I know. But you can leave your arm. Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog? No, thanks. I'll just have another Dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt. Yep, I did say that. - Jim! - What's going on? Where's the Belsnickel? Oh-- oh, my God! What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building. Shh. Let's not speak of that. The pig rib. We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash. What happened? Did you miss your bus? No. I just missed my wife. I found it! And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 AM. Oh! Damn it! Jim got the bigger half. Back for more, huh? Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy? - You! - Oh, hey, man. Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview. That's great. Right? - Thanks, man. - Hey, of course. I shall come by at your convenience. Thank you, sir. - Whoo! - Go get 'em. Oh! Whoa! Very impish. Two dimes, seven nickels-- well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. - It was one quarter and-- - Shh. What? I was just explaining-- Shh. - Why wouldn't it-- - Shh. - But why? - No more talking. Are you gonna kiss me? Yes.
To me, the Sixers are a five seat tops. I think they're going to the Conference finals. - No. - Bynum, an obvious monster. At three-point shooting, don't even-- I bit my lip at lunch today. Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough. - The Nets are tough. - Oh, the Nets are super tough. Now I have this big bump on my lip that hurts. I hate it. The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible. Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the-- Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know, I always tell my three-year-old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen-- You gotta be kidding me! Okay. Pam, that's it. I'm going home. Morning, Meredith. What? Oh, sorry. Pam. Yikes. Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly, and I'm not gonna lie-- it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice, so I was up all night, disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure, and he's doing it all for the family. I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Erving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But I have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because, let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home, stuck with the kids while she was go-karting with John Stamos? You sound tired. Everything okay? Great. Everything's great. Hey, are you nervous about your big meeting? Uh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know? But that's what I signed up for, right? - Jim, the limo's here. - Uh, you know what? I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting. - Oh, call me later. - Okay. - Good luck. - Thanks. - I love you. - Love you too. Bye. How are you doing? Okay. I mean, it's what you want, so-- - It's how it has to be. - I know, I know. It's just hard. Me and Val were going nowhere, and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom, so I convinced Val to break up with me. Here's how you do it. You say, "What are you gonna do, break up with me?" Like, as a joke. And then you gain a lot of weight. I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it. Me neither. Come here. Hey, Meredith, I need your supply requests today. Jeez H in the morning, will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you. He didn't leave me. He just went part-time. Can you just fill out the form, please? Yes. I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens. Hurry up already. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times. Holy wow, that's a big one. All right, pencils down, everyone-- we've got lice. Oh, God, Meredith! Lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower? What? Lice? Oh, my God. Lock the doors. We're on full quarantine. Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly. Just lice, Pam? Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me "freak" and "four eyes" and "sci-fi nerd" and "girl puncher," all because I had lice when I was seven. - Make way. - Dwight! No. Inspect me. Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. - You are all clear. - I should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. - Hey! - Oh! - Stop that! - Dwight! Next. Jeez, Meredith, you know, this is an office. It's not one of your bean-bag orgies. Uh, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault. Pam, really? Come on. Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taking Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen. Lice. More lice. - Angela has lice. - Ew! Oh! Ooh, yabber. Lice. Yikers. Lice. No. How? I am so clean. - Oh, yeah. Big-time lice. - Aah! I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough, not when it comes to Meredith. - Ooh. - Oh. Hey, what are you wearing? It's a hazmat suit. That stands for hazardous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice-free? Excellent. You have your own hazmat suits? - No. - No. Ugh. Renters. Okay, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse. Conduct your business there until the infected have been de-loused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch. All right. We're going down to my warehouse. That means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler, and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up. You got dumped? - Yeah, she ended things. - Break-ups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine was large amounts of Shepherd's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink. Here, man. You need them more than me. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I have not yet begun to shame. That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day. No, Stanley, if you leave now, then you'll get it in your car, and then you'll get it in your house! Get off me. I'm trying to save you from yourself! All right, I'll stay! There's a pencil poking in my rolls. Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that I got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me. Oh, man. That's fresh-squeezed. And are all the snacks complimentary? Yeah, take some home if you want. Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I Um, I'm sorry. Is this the conference center? No. Mr. Erving called. Said he's rather meet you at his private court. You gotta be kidding me. Hey, Meredith, I need to tell you something. Yeah, Pam? What do you want? Oh, my God. Meredith, what are you doing? Bakin' a cake. What does it look like I'm doing? - Getting rid of the lice. - Oh, stop! I'm so sorry! Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying? Nothing. I'm going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this. , , follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear-- it's kill or be killed! No, no, no. It's more of a nuisance, really. It's not that big a deal. So I've collected your hats and your coats - To be burned! - to be washed. What do we do about our heads? I'm not gonna lie. Lye! No. All we need is mayonnaise. - Excuse me? - She's right. It works. I would imagine. Yes. It helps to suffocate the little buddies, and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos. I can appreciate that. I also only eat local organic produce. Sha-boom! How do you like me now? - Oh! - Wow! Take a picture. It'll last longer. We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible. - Bald people make me sick. - Yeah, yeah. Everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss. Okay, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks-- it looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise. - We need it now. - Oh, uh, uh, I'll go. - Okay. - Oh, thank you. You're a saint, Pam. No, it's not a big deal, please, no. Uh, Meredith, could I get you something special while I'm at the store? Candy or-- or one of those stylish turbans? Thanks, Pam. I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools. Okay. Let's talk pubes, people. - Hey, Darryl. - Oh, hey, Val. Darryl. Oh, that was tragic. Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two still clearly have feelings for each other. Yeah. What's gonna make you feel better, big guy? When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry. I just need a moment to myself, just to clear my head. Oh, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this. I think he needs some hugs and maybe some chocolate cake. Mmm. This won't help him. It's a muffin, not cake. Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most. - An Escalade. - Or what's her name. Val. Let's get Darryl Val. I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk. Are you kidding me? I could literally scalp tickets to this. Well, you think you could sink one from deep? Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball. Okay. Wow. Halpert's got game. All right. Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. This is my wife. Can I take this? If it's your wife, you better take it. Right? Hey, what's up? Everything okay? Oh, no. Everything's great. Um, I was just calling to see, uh, how the meeting went. Oh, it's still happening right now, actually, so-- He's, uh, really making you work for it, huh? Yes, it is very stressful. Are you sure everything's okay? Great. I am killing it over here. - Jim, I gotta go. - Okay, bye. - So sorry about that. - Oh, no problem. Hey, Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of Japanese Nikes with your name on 'em. - What do you think? - I love it. Once it's all over your head, just leave it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffocate, and then pass away. Oh, sure. And when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. Put those away before you hurt yourself. Oh, God. Oh, no. No. No! No! No! No! No! No! Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up. Oscar, you want to be my partner? Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'd love to. Hey, uh, mayo buddy, $5 tip, you unclog my ears, okay? Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm-- I'm already partners with Pete. Right, Pete? Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up, so, sorry, man. Hey, Creed. Want to be my buddy? Oh, God. Stuck with the weirdo. Angela. You don't want bugs, you know? Who knows where those bugs will end up. You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more. Creed, I'm all done. My turn. I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy. Well, wait. - How's that? - I feel it working. Ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk. - Eiffel tower. - Oh! Now. Can I help you? - Well-- - Um-- We don't want to pry, but we heard you broke up with Darryl. Yeah, that's true. We think you made a big, big mistake. - Big mistake. - Quite enormous. He's a real catch, and you should take him back. Okay. Thank you. Is that all? No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are from collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you've never even worn. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? It is because, in some strange way, it is you? Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay? - Pfft! Well. - Thank you. Thank you. So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back? No. Well, then, what would you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally, forever. Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kind of feeling good about re-entering the dating pool, and then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out. - Hello? - Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. - She still has lice. - What? No, that can't-- I don't-- - Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like - Oh, my God. - Shave her head. Shave her head! You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone that I-- Yeah, yeah, princess fancy-pants letting Jane 12-pack over here take the fall! She's right, Pam. Is there a volume knob on that thing? Yes, there's a volume knob on that thing! Meredith, I am so sorry. Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster. I meant to say something earlier. I just-- Just? Just what? Just forgot? Who's the one that didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure, I gave everybody pink-eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars. And, yeah, I BMed in the Shredder on New Year's, but I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam. Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 seconds to evacuate the bullpen. At that time I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains Piperonyl Butoxide, as well as Dwight, are you okay? Whoa, the butoxide has a mild hallucinogenic effect that I don't think has kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down for ten. Nine Yellow Cold. What's that? Purple. Wow. He got to purple. Ow! Sorry. You're waterboarding me! Oops. No, this is fine. We're allowed to do this. This is okay. Okay, you're up. Yeah, I'm actually kind of sad to see this baby go. You do kind of look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Is that too cold? No. Actually, it feels kind of nice. I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. - Okay. - Huh? Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work. Oh, no. I mean, I want to. I just-- I don't want to force you into doing something you don't want to do. You're not. I believe in us. But-- I'm back together with Val. Yay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but, lice, if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. Hey, Erin already take off? I guess so. Okay. You're Kareem, coming to help. Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem, you're Dr. J. That sounds weird to say out loud. And it went like this And that's all. No one will believe this back home but that's okay. - Let me show you how - Yeah, you show me how to do it. Hey, honey. It's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Uh Well, just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you. Hey. What're you doing right now? I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day. Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer. Really? A beer sounds incredible right now. No-duh. Let's go. You're buying. Meredith, I am so sorry about today. Forget about it. I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you're rocking it. Right? I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over. Get it, girl! This one's for all you ladies out there. -  I come--  - Not yet.  I come home in the middle of the night   my mother says, when you gonna live your life right?   oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones   and girls, they want to have fun   oh, girls just want to have fun
_ Stone & Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family-owned business. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family-- brothers. We did it at a family-owned law firm, at a family-owned construction company, and a family-owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. - I was the dynamic - Yeah! Likeable winner that was doted upon by mom. Whoo! Yeah! And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that. But I knew. I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills, Jimbo, 'cause it's time for another episode of "handsome and stinky, paper brothers for hire." Sorry, stinky. Can't do it-- too busy. Oh, God, this again? You're stinky. Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be - your older sister or something. - Phyllis my sister? More like my dead great-great-grandmother who died of stupidity. I have ears, Dwight. Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim? Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now. How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour. Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour? Mm. That's a good question. Um that comes to 25 minutes. Yes. Oh, well, thank you, Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye-bye. Love you. Darryl, looking good! Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim's company. Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him? Why don't you come along and tell him yourself? Ha ha. That'd be great. Kinda like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get what do you get? Oh, my God! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. - Can you cover that? - Mm-hmm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details. A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything's in order. What? Everything? What-- how do I make sure it's in order? I-- haven't been trained for this. Okay, see you later. Hey, guys. - Clark. - Hey. Hey, look who's back. Dwight Junior. Hey, so how was it? I mean the sex with Jan. A gentleman doesn't discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved. Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean, it was like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was, uh like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room. Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, "talk classy, act nasty." What's with the wig, Meredith? What, is it on backwards? Nope. You got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It's an espresso maker. - Ooh! - We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast, so bon appetit. Ooh! Now, that's Italian. My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time. Always with the friends, Oscar. Can't we just enjoy the new espresso machine? Actually, it's pronounced espresso. Wait. That's what you said. I apologize. I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So There he is! Ha ha! We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the White Pages. Prouder of me, but If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission. Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh no. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that? Ha ha ha. I loved it. How would like to pretend to be my son in order to land a sale? If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend. Then, looks like we have a deal son. Hi, guys. Hey, look who it is. Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later. Just grabbing a java before all hell breaks loose. - Try this one. - Thank you. I don't really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super-guilty if I broke anyone's trust. About the pens. You ready for your interview? I was born ready! No. I suck at interviews. I had Andy's job in the bag until my interview. Well, you shouldn't be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys - just as dorky as Jim. - Yeah, I guess. Really, you can't be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he's basically gumby with hair. It's kind of funny. Father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store. You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we, boy? No, we sure hadn't, pop. Oh! You're a hunter, I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds like Clarky and me? Huh? He calls me Clarky 'cause he's my dad. Guilty. You don't meet many hunters these days. My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial killer of animals. One time he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right off-- it was sick! It was his birthday. - Just turned three, so - Ah. You guys, I kinda think I want to try them all. Is that crazy? No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder? Taste test? I'm in.  Yolo!  - What? - Ooh. It's a thing. It means you only live once. Yeah, we're aware of what it means, Oscar. You just do not look cool saying it. - Well-- - All right, everybody. - Who's in? - Yep. Angela. Don't make us come over there. No, I don't-- no. All right, let's go. Can't I just agree without putting my hand in? - Absolutely not. - No way. Oh, fine. Okay, guys. We all drink them all. We all drink them all. - Yes. - Yes. - Whoo! - Hey. - Where's my ring? - I'm sure it'll turn up. Yes, ma'am, you wanna go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonwealth. You'll see us on the right side. You can't miss us. - Whoa. - Yes. And I want to reach every demographic possible. No, I hear what you're saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come. I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, all right? We're talking weeks here, not months, right? Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was, like - a million weeks ago. - All right. Good. Thanks, Dennis, appreciate it. Hey! - How are you? - Good. - What are you doing here? - I just wanted to see you. - That's so great! - Damn. Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here, man. You Zuckerberged this place out. It's pretty great, right? I mean, we're coming along-- hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis's timeline. - Okay. - Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home. But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark's getting out of my car. He's a good boy. Does whatever I say. I can't relate to that. My son hates my guts. Oh? Really? Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that? Well, things between me and Clark are good, not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son. Here you go, pop. I know it was just a couple minutes, but - God, I missed you. - What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a Hooligan, smoking a doobie? I sure was. Just like he taught me. - Looking cool. - You're being disrespectful! And I love you for saying that. We don't get along. Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is our relationship is - Ter-- terrible. - Terrible. Yes. Genius. Stupid, stupid genius! Wow! This place is so great. I had no idea-- on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky. Well, I mean, I don't even have the paycheck yet. It is a start-up, so These things go down all the time. If this company's going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it. Are you cool to just hang out? - Sure, no problem. - Yeah? - You ready? - Yeah. Let's do it. The pen delivery went amazing, and now I've got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I'm not one of those people who's just like, "uh, sure, I'll accept the pens when they come in," and then as soon as your back's turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit and some great pen unpacker. On the other hand they are just sitting here. Pam didn't tell me not to unpack them. Don't wanna be a busybody, but I don't wanna be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Aah! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now. It's insane. I'm sorry. What was your question again? Oh, yeah. No. I've never had an espresso before. They're good, though. A-bam! My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I've tried so far is Alpine Select! Yes! - Ah! - One! - Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! - Two! - Stop it! - Three! - That's enough, Kevin. - Stop it, Kevin! - Four! - That's enough. So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing. - I heard that before. - Well, I understand, but-- - I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son. Here we go again, another lecture from the old man. Listen to him. He created you. Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you. Women don't despise me. His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship. Thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha. But this one couldn't see it or didn't wanna see it. All right, that's enough, 'cause I can say some things about him too. - Yeah, like what? - Like the time that you got drunk and-- and then killed those kids on their way to prom. That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid and he got caught "saving treats" from the kitty litter box. Really shameful. So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-- Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers. There's obviously a volume discount if you-- Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going, "Please, kitty, may I have some more?" You can't make this stuff up! No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends. Hey, fellas, sorry to keep you waiting. There he is. My son. Got cat turd collector written all over him. Did you say cat turd collector? So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now we're just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the Northeast. Of course, that's not a mandate. "Mandate"-- always think of two men on a date. I have gay friends. I have one gay friend. - Oscar. - Mm-hmm. All right, so what makes you think you'd be a good fit here? Okay. Um all right. Obviously, y'all look really busy, and I don't want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just, uh obviously, I'm not qualified to be here, man, I'm I'm a warehouse manager, you know Darryl, I was a newspaper editor. Science teacher. Volleyball coach. I work at a home shopping network. I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one here who can honestly help. And as you know, I was a paper salesman. Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. Cool. Hey, thanks. So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company? Yes, as a matter of fact, I, uh - I wrote some down. - Oh. There you go. Wow, this guy came prepared. It impresses me! Ah. So this is what 2:00 PM looks like around here. I usually take a siesta about now. Stocking pens, huh? You're like the new office administrator. No. I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it's the truth, I swear. Pam! Pam, look out! - Erin's gunning for your job! - No, I'm not. It's not like that at all. - Forget it. I'm so sorry. - Pam, look out! Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry. What a day you've had. By the way, Jim talks about you all the time. That's sweet that he talks about me. It's too bad he still has to work part-time in Scranton though. Well, that's funny, 'cause I think of him as working part-time in Philadelphia. We can't wait until you move here. I'm sorry-- you guys are here to sell us paper? Do you mind? The men are talking. Sons used to idolize their fathers. Us old-timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract? I'd love to. Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kinda pushed me out, truth be told. I'm just here for human contact. Okay, pop. Wait. So you're the boss? That's right. - Hi. I'm Clark. - Hey. - Let's talk. - Okay. So if you look at our catalog here Well, thanks for coming down, Darryl. It was nice meeting you, Darryl. I think you'd fit in great here. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I think it'd be like you know what? I think it'd be like a Kevin Durant jump shot-- perfecto! Oh, my God. They are the ones put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece. So I'm like a three-year-old girl in this scenario. Say they don't hire you. It's not like you're out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you. And I'd only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I'm I'm not so sure I'd like living in Philadelphia. Right? Thank you! It's just Philly. Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London. - Who needs it? - Not us. Okay. So the consensus was that that was unique. They're gonna make you pay for the fish, and they wanted to know when you can start. What? How 'bout yesterday? - Congratulations. - Oh, thank you. I guess you gotta move to Philly after all. Yes, I love Philly! Two-one-five or die! No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl. Maybe I'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him. It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really, really hot in here. It's insane! They need to have the AC on year-round! January too! I don't get the point of this stupid window! I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad's suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That's why his face always breaks out. Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher? Ha ha ha. You know what, dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I'm gonna need one, right, if I'm ever gonna get a "real" job and move "my lazy ass" out of your "GD house." He's got ya there. That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful although expensive. Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island. Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker - from boring island. - That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Cartograph much? How do I look? Actually you look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father-son team. You know what? I'll take one too. Everyone, now that we have all this energy, why don't we move the copier into the annex like we've always wanted to? - Whoo! - Frickin' A! So long, noise! One, two, three! Oh! And we have torn up the carpet. Oh, we're gonna be in so much trouble! Wait! It's beautiful. Hardwood. I always knew it was down here. I just never dreamed that I would actually see it. Tear up the carpet! Whoo! Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That's how you do that, baby. It's all good. I'm ready. Y'all ready for this?  Uh uh-uh-uh   uh uh-uh-uh   uh uh-uh-uh   Everybody dance now  Yeah!  uh uh-uh-uh   uh uh-uh-uh  Kevin, move. I can't pull up the rug if you're standing on it with your rhinoceros feet. Well, I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me. Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby Aspirin? Oh, enough with the whining already. Why don't you just have some more coffee? It's all gone. I didn't get a chance to try them all because creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant. I saw the leaves twitch. - Shut up. - You shut up! Everybody shut up and work. - We don't work for you. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey. It's 5:00. - Kevin, can-- - What is going on? Yes! We did it! You opened the door. And you closed it. The boys are back in town. High fives! Ha ha! Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business-- that was about you, right? You got me! - I used to collect 'em. - Why? Each one is very different, like a snowflake. Hey. What happened here? You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That's what happened. The pens happened. Are the pens here?
We gotta clear out this cabinet, people. A lot of these are dead accounts. "Scranton Mimeograph Corp"? I don't think we're doing business with them anytime soon. That's odd. A letter from Robert Dunder. "A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance." The Holy Grail. Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail? I think I'm a little too busy these days to s-- Oh, my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be, like, six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then. I don't get it. Aha! A lightbulb. - Lightbul-- - A lightbulb! Okay. Okay. Invisible ink. Whoa. "Higher than numbers go." The ceiling above accounting! Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight! Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end and finds the fake grail? No grail? You don't remember? I don't. An X. Annex. It must open something in the annex. Oh. Whoa. "Sedes introiti." Seat of entrance. - What? - What? That's a flush. The warehouse. There's nothing down here. Oh, I expected more from young Halpert. Let's just forget it. Forget it. So how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative? Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy - named Derek McBlack. - Wow. - It's just Pete in sunglasses. - Oh. And then we had him "like" Dunder Mifflin. Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them "like" Derek's "likes." So far, we're only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big. You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together. All right. Pete and I work well together-- not that there's anything special about Pete. It could be any guy or girl-- not that I'm into girls. Not that I'm into Pete. Ugh, what was the question? - Hey. - Hey, Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital - requested a meeting at lunch. - Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later. - Oh, sure. - No problem. Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece spin and kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right? Pfft, "Athlead"? Please. They're too lazy to call it athletes lead? Jim should just call it "stumpany," for "stupid company." Nothing stupid about working for yourself, hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That's why I'm doing it. You're working for "stumpany" too? Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon I'm switching over. - What? - Yep. Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end? Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity. You won't stop until you've poached us all. - Yeah. Even you. - No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me. Bye, Dwight. - How are you? Good to see you. - Thank you. Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Ooh, I haven't heard it. So what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato? Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind. I have no information. But I'm sure as soon as they know, they'll call you. Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I'm just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let's be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with-- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb? Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital. Aw. Hey, Cece, daddy's gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. - Are you excited? - Yeah. Let's call him. Hey. I was just about to call you. Hey, hon, are you close? I am still in Philly, actually. - What? - It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board. Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it. Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call. - I want daddy. - You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. - Do you mind doing that, Pam? - Of course. Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone? Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something. Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you're not the best with the phone. I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we're getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, "bye, daddy." - Bye, daddy. - Bye. Yep. See, you still got to press "end," Pam. Press "end." Oh, check it out. This is our first real "like." - Oh, my gosh. - Oh! All right, Alan Olifson from North Dakota. He also likes hammermill and Georgia Pacific. Wow. That guy's really into paper. - Yeah. - Well done, you two. We did it. - Youth task force forever. - Yes. Bup, bup, bup, bap. And then-- oh, wait. - No, you go-- - Did I-- is that you? You go first, and then it's a left turn. No, you go-- okay. All right, all right. - Okay, start over. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, and now I've sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. And I CC'd him on every incriminating memo. "Pete and Erin, don't hold back. Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously." I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie. Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around-- on me. Just sign your name below. - You're welcome. - Wait. This says "Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge"? This-- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. - Whatever you want. - "Loyalty Pledge"? Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows. Yeah, we'll see about that. Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? "Infuriating, irresponsible" They got us set up with Windows 95, so you're kind of dreaming here. Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out. Customer loyalty, what is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean? Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches. Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client. I wouldn't say a rage. Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It's very unlikely it would happen again. Thank you. Thank you. No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? L-- - Loyalty. - Loyalty. - Loyalty is exactly right. - Thank you. Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let's all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships? That's none of your damn business. Darryl is "dating" Dunder Mifflin. Darryl is dating Val still. But he's flirting with Jim's company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to. I'm sorry. - Do I still need to be here? - Yes. I'm still having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend, Andy, is away across the ocean. - Yeah. - So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example? Let's try it out. No, let's-- let's-- let's not say Creed. Let's say Mr. X. Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy. Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy? Yes. And he didn't like it. Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X? Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with? Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas. One, two, three. Really? Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. One, two, three. Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? Oh, my God! Shh! Um, I'm sorry. I have to go. My daughter's a ladybug. I know that doesn't make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you. You're very rude. - Yes, very rude. - Shh! Kids are dancing. Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. So should we go call Jim and go tell him to go screw himself? Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that. It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products. It can. Are you pretending to be crazy, huh? Well, Andy's cute, but he's too vanilla, whereas Pete-- he's just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird. I'm just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven't done anything. - It's true. - Yeah, right. With slammin' bods like that, they ain't playing checkers. People, it's 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man? Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete? That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from? Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart and a little bit your penis. Nellie, you have to shut down youth task force. I'm not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just do whatever it takes. I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah. Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You're welcome, Andy. And you're welcome, my own ass. Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me. Peter, please, we completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim? Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s-- Oh, actually uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second. Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something. Hey, boss, you gotta jump on a delivery. - I don't do that anymore. - That's what they told me. All right, let's get this over with. You looking for fun? It just found you! Whoo! Here we go! Yeah! Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today. But I will also be delivering you a big shipment of Fun!  Tonight  How far is this place? Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. Fun. Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there. Oh, thank you. I don't know. I sort of thought I-- So proud of you, hon. Oh, I don't know. Okay. I'm just curious, though-- what do you have against Pete and Erin? Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-I just sort of felt I owed him one. Pete's a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat. I didn't really think about it like that. Yeah, well not everybody has what we have. - "What we have"? - Mm-hmm. I just remembered I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no. Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheesesteak any day. They have fast food in Philly. - Not like this. - Exactly like this. And your milkshake. - Thank you. - It's 30 degrees out. You're drinking a milkshake? Nope. Fire in the hole! Oh, yeah! Now, that's what working at a paper company's all about! Wait. What are you doing? No, I need the k-- we have to go. You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage. It's a YouTube thing. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming. Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital? Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped with that. I'll watch it. Let's get this over with. All right, you don't have to. Let's get this over with, Pam. Okay. - Oh. - Wait. What? Excuse me. Sorry. I'm in a rush to get back to work. Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off. User error. I heard it happened to other people. Oscar, don't rub it in. I'm sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child. Well, it was an important phone call. I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, "Beesly!" I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- "Beesly!" - Hey. - Hello, Peter. It barely even feels like a prank anymore. You missed a spot. Fire in the hole! Go, go, go, go! Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you, buddy! They make you come back and clean it up! I am sorry that that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force. Oh, no, I really don't think that's a good idea. Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it. Well, okay, then. I guess we don't have a choice. Nope. - Yeah. - Yeah. Lady you never stop surprising me. What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee? No. I was clearing my throat. - Good night. - Night. - Night. - Night, Creed. - Hey. - Hey. So how's it going? We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it. I'm so sorry. I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks. Oh. I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard. Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up. Um, actually, funny story-- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all. You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital? No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part. Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how. Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it. Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video. Is there-- um you want to ease up a little bit? Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it. I don't know, Jim-- maybe you should have been there. You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this. You know what? I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair, okay? This is way more intense than I ever-- Pam, I'm not explaining this to you-- Pam, I'm not going over this again. - I don't know how else-- - Jim, we-- we need you. I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week - to bring home something - I am-- I am-- - for our fam-- - I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want. I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. - Okay? - Yep. We'll talk tomorrow? Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow. All right. Great. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye. Hey, you okay? What am I doing wrong, Brian? Nothing. You're doing the best you can. Brian. Give her a minute. Give her a minute. Hey, it's just a tough situation, all right? It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard. Yeah. Let's turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough. Thank you. Fire in the hole! Go, go, go, go! - I nailed that guy, dude. - Oh, yeah. And replay. Thank you. Fire in the hole! Go, go, go, go! - I nailed that guy, dude. - Oh, yeah. I'm gonna miss the paper business.
Hey, Brian, you got a sec? Yeah. I know what you're gonna say. It's it's all right. No, I heard you got in trouble. - I feel awful. - It's fine. It was my first slipup in nine years of miking you. Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Well, thanks for being a good friend. Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? - Everything squared away? - Yeah, mostly. Pam, phone call. Um, hey, say hi to Alyssa. - Will do. - Okay. Thank you. Sure. - Hey, boomguy. - Oh, hey, Meredith. When are you gonna boom me? Listen, they're cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It's a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna - I'll see you later. - Got it. Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job? That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride. Well, uh, see, you raised it. Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did. Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, "really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses." Wow. You know what, man? I deserve this job. Mm-hmm. I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond and under. You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance. Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants. This sucks, you know? You put in and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the thunderdome. Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam. You could've just called that an alliance too, right? I chose my words very carefully. Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse. You interviewing for the sales job too? No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it. Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, I've been working here That's a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we've seen. I'm Rolf. Rolf Ahl. Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl. Go to hell. There he is. - Hey. - Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F you're literally rolling on the laughing floor. Nice. Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy. When are you talking to David Wallace? I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up. Too late. My hopes are up. Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So problem solved. Thanks, guys. And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha! I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. No doy! I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks. I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds. No earbuds! I'm sure he's just nervous. It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter. So I've got your resume here but it's not telling me everything. Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me? Well, I'm the one offering the job. What are your credentials? I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an assistant to the regional manager. I think I've heard everything I need to hear. Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference. Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch. Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next, and he's a real professional. You say, "jump," and he says, "on who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor. What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman? Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it. Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman. Pass. Next one. All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter? No, no, and no. There were only two options. Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking? This is a bus transfer. Nothing gets by this guy. Hey, Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview? Sure, yeah, go ahead. Thanks, dude. You you sure it's okay? 'Cause you're kinda Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right? - Oh, Dove Men. - Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence And The Machine concert, so Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this? Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do. Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face. Why? I need you to breathe in my face right now. What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen? Wintergreen. - I knew it, I knew it. - Yeah, good nose. I looked at you coming around, and I said, "wintergreen." I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly. Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party. That's just a classic no-win situation. - Thank you. - So I'd Kobayashi Maru it. Damn it! Perfect answer, again. - Yep. - Think, Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond - You know what, Dwight? - and anoth This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process. - No. - Yeah. Star Trek rules. It does, but still no. Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that? Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here. This is not natural. Just don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances. Of course not. But does physical appearance include smell? They smell so bad. If I ever get that bad, you'd tell me, right? Meredith, I tell you all the time. Walked right into that one. Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise. What quality would make you a good sales associate? People person. It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical. That's right. You know we live together, right? - Yes. - And I've never seen you go to work, ever. Okay. So why is this on your resume? So how'd you guys hear about the position? My my mom. Dwight called my house, but he didn't realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I-I can't stay out of her stuff. Dwight's my cousin, so I overhead him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower. You were in the shower or he was in the shower? Everyone was in the shower. It's a cow shower, so there's, like a ton of people in there. So you guys all know Dwight already? I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby. I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school. You went to X-Men school too? X-Men school? When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's school for gifted youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was con. Some people never figured it out. Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation levi's. A lot of telemarketing. I don't wanna sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something. I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn't work then. Now look what he's doing to us. Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault. - How is it my fault? - Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others. But it's Dwight who's bringing in all the weirdos. Yeah, but, Jim, Dwight's a weirdo. We can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos. Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off. Yeah, Jim? I thought our call was for later. Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying. Hey, Dwight. It's David. - David. - Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process. Really? That's interesting. 'Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part-time, he might not be as invested in the decision making process as someone like me who's here every day and, frankly, killing it lately. I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife - Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work. - Oh. Um - Yeah. Okay. I can't say that that's not fair. Sounds fair to me, David. And I know we have a call scheduled for later Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later. No. Why not do it now? Yeah. What's up, Jim? Uh well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call? I'd love to be in the loop, David. It's okay. Go ahead, Jim. There's a very exciting opportunity - to be a core investor - Okay. Jim, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Yes, okay. Bye. I'd love to invest. No, thanks. I'd like to give you $100 million. Why you make trees into bushes? You don't make paper from bushes. Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one? Thank you. Yeah. Whoops. It's dense, like bread. Dwight, you can't just hire someone - 'cause they're your friend. - I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend. They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks. You know who else was a freak? Spiderman. And he was also a hero. Your friends are like Spiderman, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating. Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch. Mandatory paintball. Uh, Wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch. Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of 'em, we were on the same team. Oh, my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof. Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this. Do you want this paper? I sure do. It's not very good. I will pay you whatever it takes. I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad. No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money. Stop trying to get my paper, buddy. Okay, read my lips. It's over. Okay, good. That was great. So, wow. You're still at the 570 number? - I am. - Okay. Good, good, good. I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University. This isn't gonna work out. Thank you. Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind, and he's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why I can't I pull the trigger on any of them? No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. Do you need to be changed? I do that myself now. Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car. No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes. Well, the joke's on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas. Hey, man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter who you choose, we're still gonna be your friend. Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina Or none of you. Yeah. You'd bring us all down here, put us through the wringer, and then choose none of us. Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you. I wish I could hire all of you. I could start Monday. Psst, Jim? Jim? Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say. Just act natural. And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk, next to your wife. But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars. Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? - I mean, it's your call. - Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor? I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray. I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin. Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal. Well, I, for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You? - Yes. Thank you. - Amazed. And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you. - I'm sorry? - What? This is such bullcrap! Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of BC. How could you do this to them? - Too much now. - Okay. Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep. Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever. That seems inconsiderate. No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe. Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would've hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor. Well, my day's shot. Yeah, it's that weird hour where it's too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson's. I got it. Paintball. Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work? And what are we supposed to do until then? - Okay. - Let's just go, you guys. Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right? All right. I think that went well. So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out hey. Meet your new desk mate. - What's up, good-lookin'? - Oh, cool. Hey, Clark. Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate. Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting. Of course. I'll call you when I get there. All right. Bye. All right. Take care of my wife. I will be back. _ _ They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well, I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours. Hey, Pam, I'm going to the kitchen. - You want anything? - I'm good. Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee. Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee. Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy? Who, me? Us. Absolutely, I do. Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that. Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great. - Aah! - No! Welcome to the club, pig! - No, Dwight! - Aah! No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
Have you seen Darryl? He's around here, somewhere. Hmm. Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. Neither guy is here. And it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's World of Lies. Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun. Darryl, meet Bear-yl. How much did you pay for that? Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe. Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But Erin was so excited about being sneaky sneaks, I went along with it. Darryl, you are too much. That guy's hilarious. He's here today. I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my bs is totally okay with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody's doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But I don't know. This time I feel like it's it's really coming together. Oh, my God! What? You've got to be kidding me. What are those are those butts? Huh? No way. No way. Excuse me, everyone. Is it okay if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday, and the Senator and I are hosting a party at our house. Oh, cute, so there'll be a bunch of kids. No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also ew. It will mostly be campaign donors. Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping $8 to Lipton for America - to have an invitation - No, no, please. You know, actually none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about. Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that Robert invited me too. - What? - He said he wanted me there - for support. - I'm his wife. Angela's husband and I are in love, but as a politician in this town you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. Me. We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too. - Hey. - Hey. We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly. Just a couple of grown, sexy ass roommates. And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's kind of nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down. Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom. I'm couching it. Which usually means there are clothes all over the living room. And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. I'm the messy one. How much fun is this? I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just he uses old T-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to "soak." He hooked me up with a job. Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but, whoever did this, will you please raise your hand? Hello? This is not over. Okay? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice. I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it, but someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. I mean, okay, not completely on my own, but in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian. Hey, so, Wade wants to send people to the saloon conference. We got to compile a list of our target clients. Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first. Who is this guy? We are killing it. - Yes, sir. - Yeah. Conference room, everybody, now. You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting. Yes, but David Wallace does, and he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff that's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting. You're telling me David Wallace asked you to call a super-secret classified conference room meeting? Yeah. Let's go, everyone. Super-secret classified conference room meeting now. Let's go. I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it. I thought that's what you were doing. Yeah, but this is different. Oh. They used worse paint than your paint. I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint, so I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing. Different-colored paint. I wanted different-colored paint in the spots where they put their paints, so it just is okay. The point is these warehouse guys are vandals, and they need to be stopped. Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall, which is so messed up. It's 6782, not 83. Uh, 6783's also a good time, less mileage. Pam, what can be done? Yes, thank you. Let's answer that question. I was politely saying nothing can be done. - I thought I was clear. - What? Come on, guys, we need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see how much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing. David Wallace called this meeting? Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently he is very passionate about public art. No, no, come on, guys. Don't go. - Pam, I'll help you. - You will? If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime. - Thank you? - I am in too, Pam. - Yeah? - Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. - And I am bored. - Great. I was hoping for a righteous mob. I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But they both have a mob mentality, and I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car. You need my pitchfork? - Hey. - What is it? I have vengeance to exact. Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event, - and I want you. - I'm not interested. But, wait, the State Transportation Secretary will be there. You could sell your bit salt idea to the highway people. If I get the deicing gig, it's gonna be on merit, not because I played politics. Hey, so a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So do you want me to go with you? - No. - Okay, I understand. I'll just stay here then, alone with the money. Oh, crap. I am handing out pieces of paper on which you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings is no one's business but my own. You're gonna compare 'em to the butts up there. Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts. I'm not drawing a butt. All right, then no bottoms. We should ask you to do big rounded Ws. Yes. Or nipple-less breasts. Okay, okay, I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go. Or melons like cantaloupes with the halves are cut off and then just the bottom parts. Well, this is getting us nowhere. We need another approach. We need to find the weakest one and separate him from the group. Yeah, I think, if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him. We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. Nate! Your mother is dying. See, I feel bad about that. It's all right. It's all right. So she's gonna pull through again? That's great. Can I talk to her? No. She needs her rest again. Now, listen, now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business. You know who the vandal is. Now I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum. Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt your Tell us who defaced the mural. He did it. All right. You can go. Give him his gum. There's no gum. There never was any gum. Wow, that's really rude. Opening with puff pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck. That painting is just How can anyone that weighs less than a Guinea hen be so terrifying? Ladies and gentlemen, Senator and Angela Lipton. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular. Oh, Robert, you're horrible. Simon, Maxine, who let you guys in here? This is the team. - Nice job, man. - You too, Darryl. What? Oh, man. I'm sorry about that. It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes. Oh. Are you really mad about this? That's my go-to thermos, that's all. Oh. It's your go-to oh, man, that's a bummer. - I'm sorry about that. - No big deal. - No big deal. - No, no, if it's a big deal, it's a big deal. No big deal. No, no, no, no, you don't have to do that. Honestly, I don't mind. Did you want me to wash it for you or? I don't know. Are you gonna wash it, or are you gonna let it soak? Okay. Here you go. Thank you. So, Frank, do you have any thoughts About what was done? By you? Maybe maybe I could get the ball rolling. Frank? Hi. Pam. I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So truly I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn. Insert apology here, Frank? I'm sorry I didn't like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny. Well, I didn't think that butt was funny. Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours. - What was that? - You know what? You people can't fire me, so screw you. Whoa. Hey, that is not okay. What are you gonna do about that? The first sorry sounded sincere. There were two or three sorries in there. - Mm, that's quite a lot. - It's a lot. That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy. Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out, huh? Who won the hugging contest? No, let me guess. Everyone tied for first. We should just take him down. Wait. Are you saying I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face. Normally I find Pam to be a comforting if unarousing presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But today she has tapped into this vengeful violent side, and I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt. He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him. - A little eye-for-an-eye action. - Yes, yes. Go all Hammurabi on this clown. We need an infiltrator. I know just the man for the job. Clark? He even looks like a mole. One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population. You two seem very close. Yes, we're good friends. Good friends. - Yeah. - And I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers, because for a long time our party has turned its back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am. I am a friend of the Latino community. And, if you ask me, it's time that we bid bigotry hasta luego. Now does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends, I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar. My friend. Mi amigo Oscar. Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend, but he could have invited any number of Hispanics that he knows his gardener Rohelio, or he could have invited Rohelio. But he chose me. Rohelio's Malaysian. The son of a bitch is Malaysian. - Oh, hey. - Hey. Hey, I usually watch TV during my lunch break. - It's cool? - Yeah, cool. It's mine. Don't worry. I didn't say anything. I don't think you had to. Excuse me? I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five-pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that, if I needed flour, I couldn't use that? What you need flour for, Jim? That's not the point. - What you making, bread? - No, I'm not making bread. What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel? It doesn't matter. Darryl, I think you know the point I'm trying to make. All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, but just, you know, I get a little finicky about my stuff. That's all. It's all good. Are we all good? We good. What's that cooler? Nothing. It's mine. What happened to my Tavis Smileys? Oh, crap. Were those yours? I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again! Do you hear me? But my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys. Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now go make your hands rough with work. Okay, boss. Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? - Like, you're smarter than him. - Shh, shh, shh. - This is never gonna work. - Shh, shh. Remember your lines. - What lines? - Go move some paper. Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse? He's not my hire, but I know who he is. Okay, what is he like? What's important to him? Does he have, like, a favorite pair of boots or a lunchbox? What, is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something? Yeah, something like that. I know he loves his pickup truck. Oh, great, his truck. Great. Get the plate number. Okay, do you know the plate never mind. Why would you know that, and why would I be asking that? So we know which truck to fill. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. - Can you fix that? - Yeah. I was kind of hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. Come on. _ Hold on a second. Sundeep, let's get you closer to the Senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar, I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the Senator as well. - Somewhere there. - He's blocking me. It's only a photo, honey. Excuse me. What's your name? - Shawn. - Lashawn, great. You want to be in a photo? Right this way. - Not you. No. - He put me here. He put you right in front of me? He placed me there. He did. He placed me here. Let's just wheel Margaret - right in front - Ow! - Here. - Oscar Angela. - Robert. Smile. I'm done. What are you is that supposed to be my mural? Yeah, Frank draws a butt on your mural. I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita. Aw, Dwight, that's really sweet. - Let's see yours. - Oh, no. I'm embarrassed. It's stupid. This is amazing! Frank, and he's leaving a trail of poops? - Yeah. - And he has saggy boobs. I saw that. It's great. I feel better. Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch. I know. You miss Angela, don't you? Ugh, don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis. I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. You know, the paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But I think the lesson will last Lady, my truck?! You had no right! No, you had no right! It's a $40,000 truck! So? You started it! So? So somebody needs to shut you up! - Hey, hey, hey! - Whoa! - Easy! - Son of a bitch! - Guys? - You're gonna hit a woman? Thanks so much for coming. Thank you so much. Well have we all calmed down yet? Yes. Sorry about that. It was all my fault. Let's all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you. Thank you for the food. And also you suck. I beg your pardon. You're, like, a terrible person. These guys care about you, and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers. - No, no, it's - You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me. It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that. Oh, no, forget about my mural. It's stupid. No, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too. It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry. Look, I don't I don't want to put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me, and I'll be there for you. Thanks, Brian. See ya. Wow, this whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people you really care about. I mean, that's just Roommates 101. - Oh, come on. - Oh. - Uh. - Oh! Damn. You wins. How good did that feel? It felt really good actually.
Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day. It's like magic. Or it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday. Alakazam. By the way, they do need an extra day next week. And poof, he disappears. Hey. Wanna play hooky today? Oh, maybe. What do you got in mind? We can do anything you want. I really wanna have fun today, because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude, he's been selfish, I think he's a big jerk, and I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do ya like me now? I hope as a friend. Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow, and surprise, today she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid we had a dog who got real sick, and we had to send him to a farm. And on his last day, we did everything he loved. Wanna play catch in the parking lot? - Sure. - Great. - Get my coat. - Perfect. Come in. Andy, hi, I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage, so I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract. I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rink-a-dit doo, rika-doot-deet doo, rika-deet-doo. I really like Andy these days. He's pretend, and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown. Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge, so I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's good-bye, chunky lemon milk. Okay, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip. I say we all have one last fun, boss-less day. Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out, no consequences. Or the mini-mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. And you get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your boyfriend. But I mean, if you don't have one of those, you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness. Phyll, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic. - Oh - They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. They use a watch repair kit. Ooh! I'll be your foot buddy. Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini-mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend - so I can get the discount. - That's what I do. Let's do it. Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the No. Yes. Yes. Why wouldn't I? I wanna pretend to be gay. I got no problem with that. All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow-- Stop talking about it. I said I'm fine with it. These are gross. They are terrible. Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill. Oh, my God. That's so romantic. It's with Brian and Alyssa. Oh, my God, that's less romantic. I know, but we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life. Yeah, yeah, no, totally. That's good. So should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate? That sounds nice. I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy, and Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife Alyssa over the years, and he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy. Oh, tiny foot lady is back. Oh Oh, get the baby clipper. Oh, so cute. You take off your glasses. Okay. What? Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl. My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what? I think you are developing. We should go and get you a training bra. Oh, you guys both think this is funny? Well, you know what? No more discount. - Excuse me! - What? Shush! Full price. - We're not together. - Oh, come on. She's living a lie. Turns out I can't even be in a pretend relationship. Hi. We'd like the couples discount on a pair of foot massages. No, no discount for two men. Two men are not a couple. We are together, romantically. Two men. Doesn't work. No discount. Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More in love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes and no kids, and we're taking our business elsewhere. Oh - Hey. - Hey, Brian. Hey. Sorry we're late. Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread. - Oh. - Yeah, okay. What? He's on a no-carb thing, supposedly. Oh. It's great to see you guys. Thanks for coming. - Yeah. - Are you kidding? Thank you, man, I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for everything, and I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy. It's fine. What are you gonna do? But if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available. Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him. That-- okay, great. Does he pay well? Where's Alyssa? Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's-- she's not gonna make it today. Oh. Actually, we're not gonna make it. We're splitting up. I have yet another sales order for you to sign. Why, thank you, Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a God. Rink-a-dink, deet, deet, doo. Hi, Dwight. You're back. And you're disgusting. Oh, geez, my nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours. - Mm-hmm. Well, well, well, look who it is. Andy. I guess I can cancel my order from zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived. - Andy. - Hey! Sweetheart! I missed you so much. Yes. Oh. Welcome back, buddy. I have been dreaming of this moment. Me too. So much. I'm so happy. I am really, really bad at breakups. Technically, I'm still dating my first-grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And I forgot to get him something. What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow. Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello. Super romantic. And I got you something. Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo, big deal, right? No, these are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. 'Cause I have this. Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called bembe.  Yoruba yoruba   aruba yoruba   yoruba yoruba   aruba raruba  Hey, burning man, if it's not selling out too much, you might wanna throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour. Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. But I'm just saying I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting. Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months? No, please, come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months? I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks and Caicos, people. It's in every bembe cafe. He only emailed me four times. Question. Where's Jim? He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch. For two hours, really? So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work. If the shoe fits  Yoruba yoruba   Ruba yoruba  We were telling two different versions of the same story, and then everything just went numb. Well, I mean, that's okay. It doesn't mean that it's over, right? I mean, couples fight. Yeah, and that's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And it wasn't until we stopped fighting that we realized it was over. It's over. I'm sorry, this is-- oh, my God, okay. We have to stop seeing each other like this. Uh, we have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other. - Yeah. - What? At least my crying won't get you fired. Crying? I notice that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous. Thank you. And you sold it to Jan, too, I mean Yes. - I'm impressed. - Yeah. Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So, gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight. You were on a boat. I was On a boat in the ocean. Okay, the issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? - Just say the word "coolio." - I'm not gonna say it. - Say it. - Not a word. - Coolio. - No. What do you think you're doing? Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages - and clear this right up. - Don't you dare, Andy. Hello? - Oh - Hey, Jan. Nard Dog here. Oh, Andy I was just looking over the paperwork. - I found a little hiccup. - Really? Yeah, it appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to. - Hmm. - Coolio. Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? - Is that what you're doing? - Coolio. I'm coolio. No, no, no, Jan, I think you misunderstood. - Yeah. - I'm coolio. It's-- it's actually just an issue-- You know what, uh, Nard Dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing, so I would like to exercise that option. No, Jan, please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything. Jan, I don't know what he's talking about, but-- Tell Angela to send me a final invoice. Uh-- - Please, Ja-- Ja-- - Ooh Oh that was not how I had hoped that would go. Hey, everybody. Great job. Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks. Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. All right. Thank you very much. Looking good. Who's that little fella? It's a bonus check for you from Wallace. Because the branch exceeded its targets over the past quarter. - Wow, that's wonderful. - Quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Great, well, we're all up to speed. Two seconds of the turd dog, and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen. Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week. He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky lemon milk. Who needs him, right? God, I just don't know what we do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months I'd like to rat out Andy, but unfortunately I have a bit of a "boy who cried wolf" dynamic with David Wallace. Except instead of a boy I'm a man, and instead of a wolf, I cried, "genetically-engineered monster wolf." I'm not gonna rat on him. Andy gave me a second chance. So the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you? Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no narc. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no narc. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. - Flesh hoover? Hi. - Hey-- - Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her? Guys, I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy, and believe me, I am too. But he has been through a lot, and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault, not ours. I don't want that on my hands. Fine. The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway. What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to bustin' some paper rhymes. Come on.  Who's that girl?   Who's that girl?  It's Andy. All right. Back to work. Okay, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why? I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy. I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out, and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress. Yeah, well, yeah, okay. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you. - It's not Brian's fault. - No, you're right. And I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So let's just forget about it. Okay. I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip? Well, we had the Scranton White Pages. Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. - Okay? - Hey, guys. Hey, David, how are ya? We were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. I'm not gonna lie-- I get as much out of it as they do. Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. Whatever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers. - Thank you. - Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go, and you and I will talk in 15 minutes? - Great. - Great job, everybody! We had to let a warehouse guy go? You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank-- Lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy. - What? - Yeah. There was a fire in the warehouse? The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers. Oh This is what I'm talking about. This would be good to know. All right, what else? We started selling balloons. - What? - Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokesbabe of Dunder Mifflin. No kidding. Yeah, in the European billboards, - she's gonna be topless. - Wow. Go, Kathy. She's like 50. - They're tasteful. - Good, good. What else? And who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank God, right? We needed the income after the fire. What fire? The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes. It looked fine to me. I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons - in the "fire." - Mm-hmm. Well, that's one of 'em, you know. Making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire. Okay. Think you'll agree I explained that pretty well. - Thanks, Andy. - Thank you. All right. Everyone. The fish sounds great. Yeah, I guess. Really playing the scales, huh? Yeah, I don't know, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish? I don't love you anymore. - What? - I still like you. But you were gone a really long time, and you didn't really email me all that much. You re-tweeted me a lot, to be fair. But I don't love you. Okay, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time, and we lost a little bit of juju, but you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here. I just said there isn't love. On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just outta sync right now. But that's just timing, and what's timing? I mean, my parents lasted 30, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time. I guess. I mean, what do we have left? if we're lucky? I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun. You got really sunburned. I'm gonna be a prune in like three years. Ugh I know you may not be feeling love for me right now, but if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So I'll feel good. And then eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again. You really think we can get that back? Yes. Come on. Totally. You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight. Oh? Yeah, I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly, and I'm sure you have stuff to do, so we can just Drop me at the bus station? Are you sure? I just feel like we're gonna fight. Yeah. So how 'bout let's not? Okay. Oh, um happy Valentine's Day. Sorry. I didn't have time to wrap it. Wow. I didn't know you kept this. - Yeah. Yeah. - Thank you. No problem. I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay, and I think we should fight. You really want to fight on Valentine's Day? Yeah, I do. Okay. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly. Hi. Hey, you okay? I couldn't do it. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just-- I just want you to be happy, okay? We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months. Andy? David. Still here. What was that about three months?
No. You lied to me, Andy! You pretended to be in this office for three months, and you were sailing on your boat! - I resent that. I never lied to you. Really? "Hey, David, all is good in Scranton, P.A." And all was good in Scranton, P.A., that day. "By the way, Oscar says hi." Oscar says hi all the time. He says all kinds of greetings hi, hello, hola. You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say hi? - Andy - You're calling me a liar? - Andy - By the way, that reminds me. I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling me lately. - Watch it, Andy. Oh, here we go. January 7, 2013. "Hey, Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there, but my wife's sick." Well, which is it? Is all well, or is your wife sick? - Busted! - My wife? This has been a really tough time. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Has it? - Erin just dumped me, and I can't remember any of the "aha" moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say, but I really miss my beard. - Shh. - It was like a security blanket. - Andy I'm not gonna fire you. You're not? - No. - That's awesome. I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So I owe you that. David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be the air for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it. We are even now. Understand? - Got it? - Crystal. And you are on very hey. Very thin ice. Vanilla. Vanilla Ice. He was a band. The Office S09E16 Moving On - Good morning. - Good morning. And how are you on this fine d Okay. Ahem. We ready? Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship will be proceeding without me. Ahem. Now I have to see her every day at work, which is brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up. He sounds like a wounded animal. Should have put him out of his misery and just fired him. I can't be around sad people. It makes me sad. I'm the same way with horny people. Okay. Yes, Pete and I have started seeing each other, and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean, I saw Pete's butt. It's sick. Oh, that's mine. I'll just I'll get it out of the way for you. Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me, because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. I'm sorry. I am just very nervous, because, honestly, this is all moving a lot faster than I expected, and and because my resume can fit on a post-it note. No, don't just let her eat the grass. She'll puke it right up. Okay, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do. - I need you. - Dah! Dwight. And you should take breaks more often. I've been waiting there for 45 minutes. - What? What is it? It's my aunt Shirley. She's on her last legs. - Dwight, that's awful. - You have no idea. I mean, her hair, her clothes, it's all falling off in great, big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit, because she was "poisoned" by aunt Shirley. What do you mean by poisoned? Probably nothing. Or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine, which is actually what it was. Okay, well, I'm very sorry about your aunt. - Thank you. - But I don't see how this is my problem. Angela, you owe me one. Remember? Now, please. She's an old woman, Angela. She needs a woman's touch. - It's all hanging out - Ugh. And there's parts of her I don't even recognize. There's this one hanging part in particular that's some sort of flap. - It's fine. It's like a prehensile wing or something. - I don't know. - Oh, God. All right. I can't okay. - I'll help you. - There's a divot where it was, and it needs it needs Where are you going? Uh. Not on a three-month boat trip. - Oh, burn. Ha. Excuse me, everyone can just leave whenever they want now? How dare you? I'm still the boss. - The answer is yes. - I have some messages for you. Are they from you? Well, no, they're from clients. Well, then I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact you can keep that big, blue nautica sweater. - I know how much you love it. - I can't. No, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing. These are messages from clients who want to buy paper. I don't want to talk about work right now. Well, I only want to talk about work right now. Then I want my big blue sweater back. Well, I gave it to the salvation army. - I've got this seat adjusted just right. - Perfect. Yeah. She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about? - I was just leaving. - Stay. We are in the brozone layer. Okay, Nard Dog, Plop, and Clarker Posey, A.K.A. Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch. Erin dumped me, natch, but she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first. I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men. Survey says Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark thirty, what do you got? Well, look at it this way. Being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you got your freedom now. Last night I ordered a pizza by myself, and I ate it over the sink like a rat. There you go. Good for you. No. You're just letting it all hang out. That's what It may not seem like it, but this really helped, so thank you. - Cool. I'll give you $100 to wear that sweater to work tomorrow. Aunt Shirley, hello, it's me, Dwight. Oh, looky here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight. - Hello, aunt Shirley. - Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny, like a little kitchen witch. This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes. New clothes? What for? - Oh, dear God. Okay. - Oh. Oh, my God. You know what, before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit. Yes. How would you like a nice, warm bath? How would you like a mean, cold slap? Ow! Okay, aunt Shirley, dear, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps? - I could do that. - Okay. - No. No. - Yeah, trust me. - No. - It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find. Step on it. Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And, if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During break-ups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places. Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping. I'm not snooping. There's just some crud on her screen. You're clearly snooping. - That's kind of uncool, man. - Andy. - Aw, come on. - That's her private property. - Boo! - Uh, hello? Who's snooping on who now? What does that even mean? - Everyone, just please - What's it say? - Put it down. - Andy. - Hey! - Come on, Andy. - Put it down. - That's Erin's private property. Oh, my God. - See. - Nosy'll get you. Told him so. It just doesn't make any sense. Darryl, Clark, Kevin, Toby, plop, take a knee. All right, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone, so I looked at her phone. Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my email account, she was devastated. Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete? - Pete. - Hmm. Pete what? It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me plop for so long he forgot my real name. Which is Pete. Hello. - Hey. There she is. - How you doing? - Hi. Hey, do I look okay? - You look great. - Okay. - Yeah. - What's that? - Is that a - Okay, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. Gotta go. Vip just walked through the door. How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear. It's a phone. Yes, it is, and thank you so much for setting up this opportunity. I really appreciate it. - Of course. Anything for team Halpert. You're gonna crush it, Pam. Thanks. - You are gonna crush it. - Mmh. Wow, I missed you. Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me? - Call you right back. What were you saying? Haha. - Aw. - Hey, Jim. We got Trent Edwards on the line. - I've gotta go. - Okay. But, you know what, team Halpert, okay? You're gonna crush it. You're gonna smash it. Okay. - Good luck. - Bye. God, she drank so much. And so quickly. Mm. In her prime, Shirls could put away homemade schnapps morning, noon, and night. Now all it takes is 1/2 liter. She's dreaming. All right. Let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down. Spray her down? No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area, very tasteful and very rustic. Hey. Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in. I just got to get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news, and, uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and turns out I contracted ch-lamydia from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame, huh? Yeah. - You were gone - I knew it! - For a long time, Andy. - You and Erin are f Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap. - No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired. - What? - Yeah. You are fired. One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And, wow, that turns out to be you. Yup, sorry.  So you had a bad day - Andy. -  The camera don't lie - Andy.  You're a big idiot, get out of my office  - Andy. -  Turns out you're fired  because you suck  And you're fired if you want to talk to me, I'll be in the annex, all right? I'm gonna be in the annex. Toby. Toby. You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right? No. Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges. Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge. All right, well, look, while I have you, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete and Erin. They already have a contract? "Mutually agree to" Every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch. - It's just boilerplate. You don't have to read it. Well, I'm not signing away my rights. I already signed it. I was just showing you. Okay, well, we'll see about that. Andy, that's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. It's the original.  If they're talking Chester Avenue   Talking triplex  talking converting is that her? Hey, guys. - Say something. I said - Hello. - Hi, I'm Mark. - Hi. Pam. Hello. I'm the horrible boss around here, but please don't hire Jamie Foxx to kill me.  Django I don't agree with the use of the n-word in that movie. It's too soon. - I'm Pam Halpert. - Oh. Hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon realty we are one funky bunch. Come on, you guys. Raise the roof when I say that. What are you, all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam-style. He's heard Gangnam Style. He knows it. Right? That's 'cause he's American. - This is Carl. - Hi. - He's, uh, from here. He's from our neck of the woods. But Gangnam Style is great, isn't it? Oh, my God. He's Michael Scott. - Time to get clean. - It's hosing time, aunt Shirley. Have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose. - We have to do chains? - Oh, you'll see. - Here we go. - Get this show on the road. - Let's do it. Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off. - Dwight! - Let's get to it. - Give it a whirl. - No. No. Dwight, I'm not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal. Stop your bellyaching and hose me. I need you to hose my aunt. - No, Dwight. - Okay, you are useless. - No, no. - Give me the hose. Dwight, I won't do it. I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady. And you two are gonna shut up about it. Do you have a bathtub? - Yes, ma'am. - Good. This is not so much an office as it is a rec room with a bunch of computers in it. And, frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the garbage, but unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do, so That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp. Don't worry about him. Alice! All right. Stay awake, okay? Hey, Nellie. Mm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month, but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up. Um You know, I've been going over my notes from the trial Oh, no, Toby, no. I feel like I might have glossed over a few minor points. No, Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes. - I've been drafting a letter. - For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just I don't want to hear it. My aunt Joan. Oh, well, she she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you, I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Can you not work on this? Work on this month's. Okay, Nana? When I say, "chillax," people chillax. Watch this. Hey, Roger, chillax. He must not have heard me. - No. I heard you. Step this way for the Spanish inquisition. Kids in the hall. Just it's not high pressure. It's just a little cawfee talk. Okay? Like buttah. Come on in here. - Mike Myers. - Oh, my God. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys were supposed to have my back, okay? Instead, you let a guy named plop steal my girlfriend. Hey, boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks. - I emailed him shots of my junk. - Ugh. Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body. - Come on, Andy. They're a good match. That doesn't matter, okay? What matters is that I am hurt. Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet. I feel like the guy Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings. - Hey, Andy. - What? You got a booger bubble going on there. Sorry. That's okay. My whole life is a booger bubble. This is a tiny resume. Papa smurf. Come back to the mushroom. - It's from the smurfs movie. - Yeah. I've seen that with my kids. It is tiny. But I've actually been commissioned by the city of Scranton to paint a mural What does this say here? What language is this? Swahili? Oh, wait a second. - Now I can read it. - Oh, 'cause it was upside-down. You're a good audience. Unlike some of these people around here. Yeah. The city commissioned me to do Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume, and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah, you don't jump ship easily like a lot of these people. I mean, they they worship me, you know, but do they like me? I mean, do you think they like me, Pam? Yes. What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I'm gonna do Dylan.  Pam Halpert is my name  I've been at Dunder Mifflin for  Seven years? Eight years.  Eight years, man  got the Dunder Mifflin blues  got the Pam Halpert blues  got Pratt went to Pratt institute  - You have children? - Two children, yes. - And you do art and painting? - Mm-hmm. - Kind of the same thing.  kind of the same thing  sometimes I repeat myself  but that's just being Pam  Well, I'm kinda cute  and I'm But I'm married, so   Leave that be Hey. You got a sec to talk? Kind of painful to chat with you, Pete, ever since the ol' one-two punch to my scrotum pole, translationpenis, translationmy manhood. Yeah, look, uh I understand break-ups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you gotta move on. Great advice. Thank you. You can leave now. Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear. Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in. Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice, and it was an ugly break-up. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day, but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now. See? We can all be friends. - Yeah. - Just get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward. I do think we can have a fair Yeah, so life gives you lemons, you just gotta eat 'em, rinds and all. And, if you don't want to eat 'em, your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun. Nothing to see here. Boss at work. This will be your desk, right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster. You must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? I'm not allowed to ask, so - I am not - You're not pregnant. I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant. - Wow. - Don'tdon't be afraid. It's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to, you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. SomethingI have to look out this window - I'm sorry, I thought this job was for the position of office manager. It is. Yeah. You'd manage this office. You'd answer the phone and forward the calls, and, you know, go for a coffee run now and again. So kind of like a receptionist. Yeah. Like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager, because it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty, pretty cool. Larry David, curb your enthusiasm. - Do you like that show? - Yes. Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted. I spent ten years as a receptionist to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just I can't. - Ow. The braid is too tight. Oh, hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still. Yes, ma'am. I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way. Okay. There. Thank you, Angela. I'm going to the prison this afternoon to go and talk to the strangler. Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler. Don't use his real name. George Howard Skub? That's a devil name. Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm doing it. I'm going. He's doing it. The fact that you've been able to cover - Hey. - Hey, how'd the interview go? - Oh, my gosh. Wait until I tell you. This guy was unbelievable. - Okay, so - I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at 8:00? And don't eat, because I'm ordering in. - 8:00? Really? I'll make it worth your while, I promise. - Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So, yeah, I'll see you at 8:00. - All right. Love you. - Love you. - Hi. - Hi. I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard. Oh, yes, the consultant. Andy said you can start right away. So I will take you to your desk. - Oh, okay, great. Thanks. - Mm. Fresh meat. Fresh meat! Just keep walking. Don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. - I'm Erin by the way. - Nice to meet you. - Cute sweater. - Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk. I'm Kevin. Pete? Alice. Oh, man. It's been a while, huh? - Oh, do you two know each other? - Yeah. We have a history. - Oh. - History. Wow. Okay. We dated for two years. That's so random. Well, is it? Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh, no. Hey, Erin, look who's back. The birdman. Hello, beautiful. Didn't you two used to do it? We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that. Hi. I'm Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Skub. This is the prison. I am not going in there with expectations, per se. I will meet George Howard Skub. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did bogart put it? I think this is the start of my first friendship. So Pete was a librarian? He worked as a librarian freshman year. Was he, like, the sexy librarian? - Okay. - Is there somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her. Hi. Hi. How's it going? Hi. Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing - Wow, this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with. Andy, that is really inappropriate. - Awkward! - It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived. Really uncomfortable situation. Yeah. That's all right, Pete. You can handle it. I mean, we all just gotta move on. Ain't that right, professor lecture-much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own-flavored? Is it just me, or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. So there's no marketing department? No. You know, times were tough. I was unemployed. I was still heartbroken over you. I've lost a good 50 pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah. It's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin. So Andy just called you up out of the blue? Yeah. He told me you two broke up. You must be pretty horny. Well, the good news is, no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? One week? Okay. Two weeks? Okay. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice isn't that the expression? Well, anyway, it wasit was very brave. It really was quite brave. I feel like a show pony. And you look like one too. Thank you, Angela. You're welcome. Would you like some stew? By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. - Angela. - Mm-hmm? Would you like the stink sack? - Is it any good? - No. You don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wishbone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack. Thank you. So when's the wedding? Um actually, we are just friends. That's what Mose said about his lady scarecrow, and look what he did to that poor thing. Hello? Hey. Back here. Wow. Seriously? Oh, my gosh. - Is that champagne? - Si, señor. Oh, Jim, I should have told you I didn't get the job. - Oh, man. I'm so sorry. - Are you all right? - Oh, yeah. I'm more than all right. There's just nothing to celebrate? Are you kidding? You're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here. You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny. All right, so tell me all about it. Okay. Well, gosh, thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you. It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. - Dwight, Dwight. - Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what, my farm is only a few acres east of here. Or we could use the slaughterhouse. No, Dwight, the senator. Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, monkey. I can't be your monkey, Dwight. I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The 80 or 90 years that I have left of this life I want to spend with you. I made a vow. I gave my word. Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine. Good night, D. How are you doing? - Is it really rough? - It is so unpleasant. - You? - Hey, love turds. Conference room now. Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How was everyone's day? Honestly, it was a little weird. Really? Hmm. That's interesting, because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item? I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes, so it feels to me like we're still in a relationship - Gabe. - a lot of the time. Ugh. And, Alice, I understand you once dumped Pete. Ouch. It was an amicable break-up, Andy. Okay, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem. It was college. That is what you do. Dude, you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that. Hey, Andy, is this at all work-related? We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you? - No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She'd plug her ears and scream her heart out. Gabe, can you stop talking? Because every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican. I got a tattoo for you. I didn't ask you to get that nike swoosh. Nobody did. You did that for you. Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing. So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete. She's nice to me. How's that P.E. Degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher. Well, guess what, he could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers. - So let's - I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle. Oh, my God. What kind of music are you into, Peter? Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe. Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of ku klux klan? - Erin, are you even hearing this? - No! Gabe, he didn't even say that. He's not a very sophisticated man. I mean, he can't use chopsticks, so do I need to say anything else? Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night. Give me one night with you. - What is that supposed to be? - I have shaved everything. I don't want you to shave I wasted two years of my life on you. - You realize that, right? - I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. I am as smooth as a porpoise for you. Why didn't you say at the beginning, "this isn't really going that well"? Shovel his sashimi into his mouth as a sport. All right, all right, yes, that is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? Yeah. Yeah. It does. So imagine, like, the real estate version of Michael Scott, and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura. - Tell me about the cologne. How much? Oh. An entire bottle at least. You're definitely hoarding this, by the way. Guessguess what poster he had on his wall? - Austin powers. - Mm-mm. - Ferris Bueller. - Mm-mm. You're getting colder. Not Night at the Roxbury. No. The odd life of Timothy green. I'm sorry. How did you think I was expected to guess that? I don't know. But it's interesting, right? - It's fascinating. - He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it, and it's right next to his desk. He must look at it, like, 20 times a day. That's amazing. Well, listen, you can't win 'em all, right? - Mm-hmm. - So the next interview has to be better. I don't know. What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing. - I know. It's just, even if it was a great boss and a great job, I justI don't I don't know if I if I want to I don't know if I want this. Huh. This is a little out of left field. Is it? I just I liked our life in Scranton. And I have started a business in Philadelphia. Little did my grandfather know, mahjong would be here to stay. Hobbies of the east continues in a moment. You could all be doing this. Just saying. I watch way too many ads online, and I don't do enough sit-ups. So I bought these. Now every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab-blasting. I call it ads for abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online. Why can't you just do regular sit-ups? I'll tell you why. Because The floor is disgusting. Yeah. My trainer said, "everybody fails working out." That's how you win. Okay. All right. Okay. Kevin, a little help, buddy. Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now? Can someone please help me? Oh, these teas are hot. Can someone help me, please? Oh, thanks. Yeah. - Okay. - Just Just People, I'm not going anywhere. Soon my core will get strong again, and, when that happens, I'll be able Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? I hey. I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here. Oh, that's not good. Hey, guys, I've got 20 bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Hold it! New glasses. Dwight, what a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died. Oh, Dwight, I'm so sorry. Were you guys close? I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt. - My condolences. - Keep them! Okay. Now, what do we got in these two pails? In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face, or I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. What color is it? It looks pretty black. Yep. Acidic all right. Oh, thank God. Excuse me? Oh, I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. It's just I have a personal training session. Okay, that's not-- - I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight Time is a son of a bitch. I'm sure-- I'm sure she's in a better place. I really hope so. Okay, now this is crazy. You can't make a dirtball-- - I miss her so much. - Okay. You know? Aah!  There's a bright golden haze   on the meadow   a bright golden haze on the meadow  - Ziek's here. - Ziek! Hey, Dwight. Mose, mom says hi. Hi to mom. You going? Will there be ghosts there? - Get in the sidecar. - Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar. - You get in the sidecar. - Get-- What are you doing here? You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face. Oh, yeah. Who is that? Jeb, my brother. - You have a brother? - Mm-hmm. I didn't really see a better parking spot. Oh! Look what I did. It's a rental. - You wanna go in? - No, you do! You wanna go in? You wanna go in? - I'll put you in there. - Okay, I'll put you-- - Here we go. - Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Oh! - Oh, gosh. - Hey, moonface. Nice to see those shiny little Chinese eyes of yours. Who's this guy? - Bad. - Hi, all! Why are you here, Todd? Okay, let's get right to it, I guess. My name is Todd Packer, and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous, step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did. Packer, we accept. Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this, and I have to go through examples of stuff. Okay, uh, where to begin? Hey Pam-Pam and her pam-pams. Well, I have said some crude things about those. But they are beautiful, and I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you and personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. Oh, boy. I have not been nice to you. Phylly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size to your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin this kid in a few years. Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology. Why can't I just be nice? Truth is I really like you guys. I really do. Okay, the apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends, and that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown mall, and I got you all cupcakes from that place Nipples. Think it's called Nibbles. Ha. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? Ohh there you go. Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake. We are here today to join this woman on the ground. Man is born of woman, and his life is full of turmoil. It's crap soil. Nothing's gonna grow here. It doesn't matter. It's a cemetery. Yeah, well, I'm saying it's garbage soil, that's all. Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies. That's fine, 'cause they're not gonna grow. Well, thank God they're not, because we don't wanna make zombies. Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any. Would the family care to say something? You had black hair and then gray hair. You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life, you were 5'4". At the end, you were 5'1". They're a descriptive people. I see you started without me. You were late, so what am I supposed to do? - Hi, Fanny. - Hey. - How are you? - Who is that? - Dwight's sister. - Dwight has a sister? Yeah. She's beautiful. Blech. Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. Wha-- what is this-- oh, God. What'd he-- - Henry. - Dwight. I see Esther's back in town. Hi, Dwight. Hi, Esther. Nice of you to come today. This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn. Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens? We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here. - Okay. - Okay. - Anyone mention her height? - Yep. Land size? Shirley, at 1,600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area, sharing borders with six other farms including my own farm and your nephew Dwight's. Okay. So let's get it going. Would you want to do the honors? Oh, right, uh you know, I-I don't think we have to do this. We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead out of kindness. That's it for me. I don't think we should eat Packer's cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction. I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense but they're also really fluffy. We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And he still is. How much is a cupcake, Is that the price of our dignity? I never forget a number. Names, in one ear and out the other. Places, nope. Faces, that's rich. But numbers I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant. Hey, man, I don't think we've met. - I'm Clark. - Oh, I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat little runt earlier. You didn't actually say that. - No? - No. Wow! I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. Hmm. Hey! I have a crazy feeling that you are really gonna like this. Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank, and you did fire him. I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong. Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart? Do they even have a bakery anymore? They do. It's awful! And it's getting worse every day. So it really is just about the cupcakes. Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes. So we're all agreed no one touches those cupcakes? - Okay. - Okay. Packer can go to hell. Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fanny, a single mama in the city. Thank you. Jeb, a street pusher. After I left the army, I bought a nine-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out, "worm" means something else out there, and I am now in the business of pain management. Or the smoking of pain management. I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwich. We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So here are my terms. Dwight, Fanny, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. - So there you have it. - Is she crazy? - Dwight? - Dwight? Buddy? - No, no, no. - Snap out of it. Dwight! Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom! No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. - Are you crazy? - Of course you are. Look, I don't wanna be mean or, like, insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain - sort of sophistication - Oh, my God. That Cami and I are drawn to. and I don't know, the men are just-- It's almost like there's a-- a willing ignorance. Yes, I-- thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And I was recently published. Which is just-- maybe I have-- yep, I do. Here it is from the, um hartfordwomenslitquarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fanny Schrute. Totally. Yep. The people here are like like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart. You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer. Couple of nights couldn't hurt. Oh, somehow I think a couple of nights could hurt. You will say yes on one. Get ready to say yes. One! - Yes! - Absolutely! Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one, and Mose was the visionary, which left me to be the comedian. - That doesn't work on me - Okay. By the way. It's not-- Quatre, trois, deux, un. Oui on un. Oui, un! - Very clever. - Oui! - Okay. - Oui, mais oui. Oui, oui, oui. - Oui. - Oh, my goodness.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our--  People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our walls aluminum   we'll fill our mouths with cinnamon   now  So I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our walls aluminum   we'll fill our mouths with cinnamon  Hey, uh, I just wanna say I'm sorry for screwing you. I'm not sorry about it. I am. It was my rock bottom. - Kevin, you can do this. - You don't know that. Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right? Mm-hmm. James Bond was a spy. - Yes, he was a good spy. - Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake. Hey, you know what, it was great to see you all again. Take care. I am going through a 12-step program. I'm currently on step zero which is have a shitload of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire The Packman and expect to get away with it. Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. Hey! - What, Pam? - Wait! He's gone. It's just a cupcake now. No, no! It's the principle of the thing. Oh, my God. I forgive him so much. - Whoa! Is he choking? - Kevin? Oh, that was fantastic. Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them? Yes, very. You really need to stand back. 'Cause these are killer chickens. I was just asking you something I didn't know. Which is fine, and you learned something. But it was kind of a stupid question, so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit. Are we gonna eat these today? If you want. Is that a guillotine? This? No. That'd be cool though. It's for milking. That's a cow? Did you just ask me if this was a cow? What are you doing now? Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull, use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right, going all right? I don't know. Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy? - I don't know any of that. - Okay, you suck at this. Gimme those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything? I never met him. Good morning, Erin. Hey. Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim, I talked to my sister, and I think that as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's okay. I don't care what you do, Pam, just please stop making noise. Phyllis! Packer laced the cupcakes. No! Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned? - Some of us got both. - Oh, my God! Is everyone okay? Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then I ordered ten American Girl outfits on line. It was thousands of dollars. Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet. Me too. I went Christmas caroling in March, and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So not my best night. But not my worst night. What did you do, Andy? Last night! Oh, God, um I don't know. Noth-nothing, really. - Kevin? - Why would you ask me? No, I'm not a-- I just-- I don't know. Oh gosh, I actually-- it is hard to recall. Um, pretty normal night. My night was just like that - Yup. - Okay. Meaning normal. Yeah, I didn't see you last night at all. Nope, I did not see you either. Wow! He is officially the worst human being. Ah! But Kevin, that's-- Yeah, no, I understand, Pam. I understand. No. Ohh. So that's it. I just wanted to make amends. - Wow. - That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage. Ooh. Red velvet. I should apologize too. It's okay. I'm over it.  When we arrive, sons and daughters  Ooh, this is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Mm-hmm. - Not it. - Not it. It. If your kid doesn't put in some farm time, or he's gonna stay like that. All right, fine.
Oh, oh. She's doing it again. Phyllis has gotten into audiobooks. And lately she's been listening to 50 Shades Of Grey, which, if you don't know what it is, - it's a book about, uh, um-- - It's porn. Yeah. Seriously? This is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment. Why? Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not okay to do this in public. Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off the pillow once, and I got bit. Just ignore her. Sooner or later, she'll finish. Meredith! Good lord. - What? - Phyllis is masturbating in the office right now as we speak. Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her? He can't do that. Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal. Doesn't become a violation till she physically acts on it. W-w-wait, wait. Why is Phyllis so aroused? She's listening to50 Shades Of Grey. Well, there you go. That'smuy caliente. Okay, you are useless. I'll take care of this. What the hell? It's okay, guys. She's no longer horny. Excuse me, dirty birdie. What? You can have this back at the end of the day. Okay. Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles. - What's her name? - Esther Bruegger. - Sweet. - Lives on the neighboring farm. - 85 acres. - Oh, yeah. Keep talking. Well, we've been out three times. There has been physicality. The thing is, we were hanging out with her father the other night, looking at a farm catalogue, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me. What do you think? The same thing that you think. Long-term tractor leases can put pressure on a relationship. God, a lot of my buddies are going through the same thing right now. Something in the air. Here you go. And good for you, Dwight. I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes. Dwight is dating a Brussels sprout farmer named Esther. She's coming here this afternoon with her father. Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart. Cece has been calling me Pamela. Like, four times this week. Oh, man. I wonder if she'll start calling you Jim. Oh, boy. Please don't. - I know. - Let's not let that happen. Um Oh, what was I gonna-- what was I gonna say? Well, you know, your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen? Not that Ryan Howard. - The Phillies first baseman. - Oh! Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Um, okay. - Well - Yeah. So I'll talk to you later? Yeah, sounds good. Okay. - Okay, great. - Yup. - Bye. - Bye. What's going on? Ooh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song? There's a promo for the documentary on the web. Play it again. The boss. - There's Michael. - The workers. The lives. The loves. The people. The paper. The Office, An American Workplace. Coming soon on WVIA. Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes, and everything changes. This is a documentary? Ohh. I always thought we were, like, specimens in a human zoo. Did you see this? Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer. Oh, my God. Is that you and Jim? - Uh-huh. - Jeez. You fell in love with that hair? Really? Yikes. That is awful. It wasn't so bad. Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. "Banjo at 0:19 is a'ight." Internet, calm down! I must have really connected with this guy. I mean, that's a guy's name, right? Chobblegobbler? Hey, man, how you doing? Jim Halpert. Nice to meet you. Eat fresh. - Hey, man. Darryl. - Hey, man. Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat fresh. Eat fresh. Let's go to the conference room. Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let me see. I know she likes apples and carrots. I bet she does. I bet she'll eat 'em right out of your hand with those big, strong teeth. Did I tell you about her teeth? Hey, Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper. Yes. Ah, the Bruegger family. Welcome. Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls. Yes. Esther. - You look radiant as always. - Thank you. I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean, if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that thing. Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much. We've all changed. With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they retire your number. And we all know baseball does not last forever. I look at these actors on TV, and I think, "come on. I can do that." Right? Watch this. Eat fresh. Now what does that make you think of? - Subway sandwiches. - Yeah. How? I didn't say "Subway sandwiches" it's called playing the subtext. - Wow. - I actually wrote a screenplay. It's called The Big Piece. Based on his nickname. I like it already. Let me guess. It's autobiographical. Half-biopic, half-superhero movie. The mild-mannered professional baseball player Ryan Howard - hits a home run - Okay. into outer space. Ball comes back with space dust on it, which transforms him into the Big Piece. Big Piece. - The space dust does it. - Space dust. - Okay. - I actually brought some copies of my script if you guys want to read it together. Sure, yeah.  Hollywood  All right. - Yeah, we're gonna read it. - Okay, great. Andy, are there documentary groupies? Of course there are. Of course. A little ironic that I'm gonna be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flenderman novel was based on a murdered TV star. - The Small Scream. - Oh, I don't care. Hey, guys, I just found another promo. - It's in Danish. - Danish? I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark. Oh, my God. What was that word they said when they showed me? Skrald mand? What's that mean in Danish? "Cool guy?" "Dumpster man." Cool. Superhero. What about me? - Cloken tre pige. - Tre pige. "3:00 PM girl." What? Why would they-- w-- wait a second. Wait a second. What was that? I didn't know they were filming then. It looks like the cameraman was hiding behind the shelves. Wait, so they were filming all the time, even when we didn't know it? Oh, my God. There is much more secret filming than I expected. But I am fine with it, I mean it. - I am. - Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage. I am a very private person. I show 'em when I want to show 'em. Who wants a taste? Boob sauce! - Meredith! - Come on! Oh, my God. Do they film us at night - when we're sleeping? - Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping 'cause that makes great TV. - Hey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oscar. - I'm sorry, sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out. I have been very honest with you guys in a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not gonna use any of that, are you? People, relax. We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? Smokethatskinwagon says, "you guys are killing it." I mean we're internet sensations, guys. I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk. Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. Okay. Okay, everyone, turn off your mics. We need to know more. Did those shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape? I sneezed into my hands without using purell and then dipped into the candy jar. - Did they film that? - My first week here, I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more-- I thought I'd get more screen time as a villain. Okay, Pam, why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired, find out what they got? Brian? - Yeah. - Yeah, I guess I could. Hurry, Pam. I need to know how much hellfire is gonna rain down on me. I thought Teri knew about Cynthia. She does, but neither of them know about Lydia. - Ooh. - Wow. Whoa! Okay, so what's this lever do? That manipulates the secondary shaft. Oh, the secondary shaft. Ah-ooga! The lift capacity's up to 2,000 pounds. That's a lot of beets. Let's talk terms. If you agree to a 40-60 split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns. Mr. Bruegger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? or no deal. Esther, get in the truck. No, wait-- okay, wait. You win. Let's get the paperwork started. We should buy an Auger together. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, we should do that. You would be a great one to buy an Auger with. Hello, honey, I just spoke to the TV repairman, and he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring. Oh! Seven new comments. "The guy at 0:19 is hawt." "Hi, bongripper, it's me, Andy, the guy from 0:19. I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment. Going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!" "He's not hawt. He's gay." "Dear jasonjasonjason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay. So you're an idiot. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again." "He is hawt." See? Thank you. That's more like it. "He is butt." Agh! Damn it! I'm about to lose my freaking mind! Screw you, texaspoontappa. Ugh. Security deposit. That's been-- - Standard. - Right. Standard. Hey, can I talk to you for one second? Not now. No. No. - Just one second. - No. - One second. - I'm closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate. - Don't do it. - What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do-- no! You capped it! Wow. You are serious. Okay, you've got two minutes. Then the cap comes off. Dude, we're being conned. Go on. These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor. No. Yeah, the sister's trying to seduce me into buying an Auger with her. What? Has the guarantee expired on the Auger you have now? I don't even know what an Auger is. No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an Auger is. Hey. You ready to sign? I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. Oh, hey. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. Do you have a minute? Is this a bad time? No, no. Please, yeah. Come on in. Good to see you. Um, sorry. My place is usually not this-- Oh, my gosh, please, don't. Yeah, no, I-- actually, it's always like this. You want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there. - Sure. Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. - Let me grab a couple drinks. - Okay. Oh, wow, you have a nice view. All right. - That's for you. - Oh, thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. All right. How much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the Senator? They caught us kissing on Halloween. He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! - Oww! - God. Angela! Well, he kissed like Jack Kennedy. - Oh! - Stop it. Stop kissing him. Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career. I don't like giving him bad news. - Call him! - You call him! - Call him! Call him! - Stop hitting me! No! - So - So What brings you by? Well, the promo for the documentary aired today. - Oh, yeah, that's right. - Yeah. - It's kind of crazy. - It is. See all this, like, old stuff. - I know. - Like, there's that shot - of Jim and I up on the roof. - Oh, yeah, that was-- - that was a good moment. - Yeah, wasn't that neat? - Yeah, that was cool. - Yeah. And there's this one when we were listening to music, and it's like-- it's like we were in love, we didn't even know we were in love. And it's-- but do you think Jim's changed? - Um - I'm sorry. Did that-- but that was out of the blue. I just mean, because you know us, and you've, like, observed us for ten years, and I feel like he's-- I just feel like he's so into his work right now, and I don't know. Am I crazy? No, you're not crazy. Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos, and they're kind of freaking out. 'Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera. - Yeah. - You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see, and they kind of want to know how much. They want to know how much what? How much stuff you got. Pretty much everything. Well, yeah, but what if we turn off our mic packs? They've got parabolic mics. They can pick you up So, no, if you were around there, they got you. So we basically had no privacy for ten years. That's not really true. I mean - that's-- - Um yeah, I gotta go. Oh, no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry. I-- I-- I can explain this so much better. No, I think you explained it. Look, if you give me a chance, I can-- Pam. "We will win this baseball game against the Evil Space Yankees. Eat fresh." That'll pay for the exploding helicopter. - Smart. - Mm-hmm. "Suddenly, the Evil Thugs break into the stadium. The Big Piece hits baseball at the Evil Thugs." "Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks." Come on, man. Sell it. Yeah, Jim. "Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!" Yeah, that's better. "A bunch of hot women go, 'oh, yeah.'" "Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you." "They kiss. It is super emotional. - Like in Toy Story." - Wow. I tell you what. It's really strong. Can't wait to read the rest of it later, - see how it ends. - It's so strong. Keep reading then. "Gotta go. Darth Vader's launching a huge attack." Um, another thing. I'm gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader. I don't know how we'd go about doing that, but - We can look into it. - We'll look into it. We need Darth. - We gotta get him. - Go after Darth then. - We're gonna go get him. - That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go get him. Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten, and the best I've ever done is Angela, who's a nine, and she rejected me. A Scranton nine, but, yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours, huh? I mean, there are no games with fours. Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kind of guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy. Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we got to plant our seed - a different way. - By hand. Dwight. We need to talk. I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther. Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days, but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends. No. So you're gonna be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles, and he's pocketing a profit - behind your back. - That snake! You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles, or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine. That shady grove out by Willard's pond. Mm-hmm. So you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed? Of course. You didn't think I was just tractor bait, did you? N-no. - That-- - Yeah. Hey, Dwight. What's an Auger used for? Post hole digging. You've reached Senator Robert Lipton. Please leave a message. - Hi, honey! - Hey, honey. - No, you go. - Go. No, go ahead. - Hi, honey. - Hey, hey, Robert. - It's Angela and Oscar. - Hey. Just a few quick things. Um, the documentary's going to be airing soon, and-- and you look great in the promos. - Oh, you look so handsome. - Oh. Very presidential. - Very much so. Absolutely. - Yeah. Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay. Yes, and I cheated on you with Dwight. It looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it. - I think that's it. - I think we're good. - Done. Okay. - Bye. Love you. Hey, texaspoontappa and jasonjasonjason and all the rest of you haters out there, check this out. _ Good night, Andy. Huh? Yeah. See ya. Oh! What? Elskere. I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. _ _
What the hell? No, this is not happening. Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon. Come on, Stanley! Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in 100 years. It's a "mageddon!" Come on! Come on, Stanley. Stay in it! I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they're making me climb stair mountain! Come on! Our office has an unusually large number of unusually large people. - This is an abomination. - Come on. So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time. Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in. What? I just got a text from my brother. Scrantontimestribune.com. There's a review of the documentary. What does it say? I don't know, Phyllis. I just got the text and started screaming, "Red alert." Well, the alert was already set to "red" because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to "double red"? I think we should. "The Office: An American workplace "airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton's own Dunder Mifflin paper company!" Whoo! "In this series, which will air starting in May, "we get an in-depth look "at many interesting local people. "There's Kevin Malone, the Falstaffian accountant. "Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get." What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news thing. "Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund "child-slash-middle manager, "whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy." Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that's-- It's okay. The hell does he know? "A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent." I want you to print that out for me. I will. Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb. "Though it mostly focuses "on the daily realities of office life, "a lurid subplot reveals "the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values." Oh. Which public figure? I bet it's Katie Couric. I've been saying this for years. No, I think they mean more like a politician. You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like, Jackie Joyner-Kersee? Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should've called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! - Here we go. - Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator. The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order. You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete, iced tea. Three sugars, five creams. Your morning 3x5. Coming right up. Well, we won't be late. I love you, mom. Thanks. Oh, your mom's watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? Oh, um, Embassy suites. "Do not disturb" sign on the door. Mommy and daddy are on the floor. I wish. What, then? Oh, nothing that exciting. Marriage counseling? Hmm. Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had? You know, Jim's kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help. Mmm. I mean, we're having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right? Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question. Oh, sure. It's a little, uh, personal. Let's do it. Let's get personal. I wanted to talk to you about your divorce. Whoa. Sorry. I-- no, no, no, what I meant--what I meant-- Oh, yeah, no, it's okay. I can handle it. Um, so you guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it. Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couples counseling? Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren't in couples counseling, are you? Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couples counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better. Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. So s--hey! Hey, hey, no! No. Get outta here. - Clark, get outta here. - My mistake. Yes, it is your mistake. He's lingering. So annoying. I'm gonna kill him. How can I help? I'm here. That's all right. Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Good-bye. Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls. Don't worry, I've scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the cameras together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on. All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry. I'm a better wife than that. Andy-- I need to talk to you. Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. I can't even keep up! Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call. I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final. So what I'm hearing you say is, "Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible"? Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent. Mm-hmm. Good luck. Directory? Movie star department. Back. Directory. For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts. Hey, Dwight. Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale. Pass. Hey, c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next? Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker. Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha-- Holy shit. No, you didn't. Sick of you and your--ooh-- It's all right. Andy approved it. Man, he's really in Twinkle Town now. Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him? Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do. - You gave him three shots. - Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. Grab his feet. - Let's go. Move it! - All right. One, two, three. He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! Oh, God. No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain. We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something. Yes. Okay. We're good. We're good. Let's go. Oh, my God. - Push. - I am! Any good weekend plans? - I might see a movie. - Nice. What about you? Uh, I don't know yet. - Let's take him-- - I was thinking about Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay? And then what? Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before. Well, if I may, you're a natural. Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head, like, 1,000 times, but, uh That's a little weird. I know. Evel knievel. That's about as good as that's gonna be. Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go down to the bottom and catch him. - Catch? - Yeah. I can't catch him, he's, like, 250 pounds. You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? - He's gonna be moving slowly. - Blunt? It's only--it's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicine-- Dude, the size of my haunches-- Okay, good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall. We should probably call a doctor or something, dude. You okay? So how does it work? Is it like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator. Mm-hmm. He might start by asking each of you, "Why do you think you're here?" He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that. If I didn't do certain things without telling Pam, she'd be married to Roy I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up. If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I--this will be so huge for our family. Well, what's a little while? What do you mean? I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end. That's kind of an impossible question. Oh, guys, it's starting! Hurry! Ooh, there's Angela. I work with her. Huh. Yeah. I mean, I'm happy Angela's the first one getting famous, but it's a little weird, no? I mean, she can't sing or act, so it's actually kind of insane, if you think about it. Her hair looks beautiful. Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin' movie star! Andy. I would just like to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest I am gay. Senator, were you always gay, or did your wife turn you gay? Question for the senator's beard. I'll say it again for mis amigos latinos, - yo soy homosexual. - Poor Angela. Yeah. Poor Angela. I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn't until my marriage to Angela that I realized how charmless I find the female body. Ooh. Always hurts to hear that one. There's someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez. Come on. Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. Oscar is with the senator too? Yes! And I knew it the whole time. I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew! - He knew! - Yes! We did it. You did it, Kevin. Yes! Oh! I did it. I did it. With this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing Chief of Staff Wesley Silver. - What? - Wesley Silver's gay? They make a nice couple. Almost there. Almost there. Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside. We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this. Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation. That's actually really smart. Thank you. God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge. Let's get him inside. Carla Fern is not just an actor's agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate. Actor? Oh, no. Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse. Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that? Eh, you go through a lot of mice. It started by accident, actually, as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidentally put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was like, wait. Wait a second. Does anything go on top of the mouse? Yeah. - Little hat. Yeah. - Aw, that's cute. What's the mouse's name? Eh, you know, it really doesn't make sense to name the mice. They're kind of like cannon fodder, you know? You're not one of those PETA guys, are you? Oh, great. Hey, wait, wait, how-- how we doing this? Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters. Just say "arms" and "legs," okay? That just-- that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with. Fine, let's go. Hoist his shank on three. - What's a shank? - It's by the tenderloin. Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can you-- slouch him into the seat. Here. Go around, get the seatbelt. All right. - Got it? - Yeah--yup. Get in the back. - What? - Get in the back. - Aw, come on. - Get in. Damn it. Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do? - Hello. - Okay, we--hey. Hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay? - Pigeons. - Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson. Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister? New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go. Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go. I'm sure athlete will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly. Well, if Pam says she won't go, then-- We're gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph. That was exhausting. Blah blah blah blah. Jim. Well, they deserve each other, then. - They do. That they do. - That is for sure. That they do. And for--oh, whoopsie daisy. Stanley, what is going on here? He's fine. - He gets carsick really easily. - Driving. It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley? Ooh-hoo, look at that baby - Stanley. - Oh That's Benji in the middle. That's Benji. Oh, he's precious. That's a healthy-looking baby. Very special little boy. Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child. Funny sense of humor. If you push his nose, he'll go, "Eee." - Like this? Watch. - Eee. Like that. A beautiful family. Right? Come on! Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis. So what can you do? Well, what can't I do? Right? I can sing, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn't noticed, I've got a pretty good British accent. Can you drive a car? At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here. Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45? My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal's going out on. Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap? Yes. And yes. Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid's party, let them throw pies at ya? Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. I'm all for it. Well, Mr. Bernard, I'm gonna be honest with you. Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much. No, we're--we're gonna take you on as a client. You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me. We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out. Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots. Uh, it doesn't include headshots. - It doesn't include headshots. - No. Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though. So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it? You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell Andy the good news. Oh.  Silly me. Gotta take the stairs. Oh, no, I'm not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up. Well--no, no--n-- We need a winch and a hoist.
Oh! Hey, champions. Good morning. Quarterfinals in an hour. I hope you had some sleep, because I'm gonna be hunting your nightmares tonight. I did. I got some really good sleep. - Did you? - Zzz. Yesterday was the first round of a branch-wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyerhammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product, Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. It's practically made of plastic. We started with 16 brave aviators. Some used skill. Others relied on showmanship. Others seemed not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. And of course there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster. Hey, I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through. Beep beep. Ow! Ow! I didn't see you. You should have yelled, "crossing"! I'm sorry. Okay, so is that my spot? We are now down to an elite eight. Well, seven and Toby. "Be careful of that beaker. It contains dangerous acid!" It does not say "dangerous." And there's no exclamation point. Well, I'm just I'm trying to bring some life to it. Last week I got an agent. And this week I got a movie. HRPDC Chemical Handling Protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community, one of whom could have a cousin whose brother is Brad Pitt. And then, boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs 2. - Andy. - Go away. We're running lines. You wanted to see the gooey eye. Oh, yeah. All right, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. It just wow. Ugh. Ugh. I can't even. I'm so freaked out by that. Just go. Go, go, go, go, go. All right, but it's getting gooier, - so we'll just do it later. - Okay. All right. Where were we? Something full of acid. "And, remember, do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. It will only exacerbate the flame, the dangerous flame." That was great, man. All right, I'm out of here. Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times. Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep, and I really appreciate that. Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that. So we had couples therapy. No shame in that. Get it all out in the open. And we have homework. Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices, because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly. And we're also supposed to speak our truths, because, if I had spoken my truth earlier about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity - for couples therapy. - Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do opportunities. Heads up, everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig. - Hey. - Yeah. Who's Carla Fern? Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. She's my agent and my drill sergeant. And one of my best friends. Oh, and, Oscar, I already figured out if I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just gonna think about you getting dumped by the Senator. Why don't you just use your own life? Erin just dumped you. A little raw. Not cool, Oscar. - But you just - Not cool. Okay. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyerhammer Paper who will be joining us to judge the final rounds. Who's pumped for the quarterfinals, huh? I'm pumped. - Clark's a dead man. - All right. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. - Oh, my gosh. - Wow. Nellie, you didn't tell us we could win money. Oh, yes, I did. I told you all. It was 'cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget. Not one of us remembers you saying anything about $2,000. I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense. Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously. Oh, please. Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator, but my new studio apartment is just fine for me and Phillip and Tinkie and Crinklepuss and Bandit Two and Pawlick Baggins and Lady Aragorn and their ten kittens. Oh, my God. Come here, come here. Come here, let's go. I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And, if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer. I offered myself to Angela, and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest, when it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent. Oh, wide wings, interesting. Hey! Why don't you back off? I mean, best of luck to you in the competition. Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids for everything snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kind of worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped Greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head just for a handful of Crispix. Are you in that paper documentary too? Yup. - You need an agent? - No. I mean, you never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage. I was inThe Wiz in high school. That's the clicky-clacker. He clicks that, and then the guy says, "action." Hey, I made 'em get you a chair. All my clients sit. Can I take your picture? I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah, sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you, and then I can take it We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off. Got it. Sorry. No, if you just keep it down until Okay. Okay, next up we have two creatures great and small Kevin versus Angela. Yes. Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself? - Uh-huh. - Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself, 'cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane. Of course. Kevin, did you make that yourself? Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist. - Oh, man. - I call for a refold. No. - Really? - You can't do that. Thank you. This is flatter. It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane. Okay, that's enough. This is the end of the ream now. - You have to pick one. - I can't. I love them all too much. And none of them fly. So that makes it harder. You have to choose one now. Fine. - Angela advances. - Nice. Whoo! Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed. I'm not giving up. I am gonna keep making planes until one of 'em flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher. An Earl Grey tea for the lady. Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way - to get me tea. - Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way, 'cause I felt like a tea anyway, so one trip. Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture. We are rolling, and action. This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death. Okay, stop. Why are you smiling? I just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job. Okay, well, maybe no smiling on this one. So how do you want how should I do it? I don't know. Just like you're reporting the news or something. Okay? - Action. - This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. It's Tom Brokaw, the newscaster. Come on. - Who was that? - Tom Brokaw. - Come on, Clark! - Come on, Clark! - Whoa! - Yeah! Oh, eat it, piggy. Eat it. Oink oink oink oink. We still got to work together, so we should keep it civil. I can't hear what you said. You get your slop? All right, you know what, this is completely unnecessary. You already won. Just stop. - Erin. - What? - Relax. - Next up we have Dwight - and Phyllis. - You can do it, baby. No, you can't, baby. You're gonna choke. - Watch and learn. - Wow. Whoa, Dwight defeats Phyllis. Dwight, you are through to the semifinals. - Yes. - All right. Oh, Esther, what are you Hey. You're here early. Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast, 'cause I knew I was seeing you tonight, so there might just be a little bit of feather in your nuggets or just a little bit of meat inside of your pillow. I like a little feather in my nuggets. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now down to the final four Dwight, Erin, Angela, and, God only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with $2,000. Yeah Okay, here you have just knocked over the beaker. The chemicals splashed in your eye. - Which is insanely painful. - Yeah. And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap into to really express that pain. That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kind of flush out your eyes, you know, get the chemicals out, all right? So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later? What water special effect? Yeah, just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs. Like that. I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to. I'll go full Lena Dunham, but I Dude, we don't need you to go nude, okay? Absolutely not. Just do the eyewash thing, okay? That's all we're asking here. Darryl, what do I do? Hold up, I'm looking at my spit in the microscope. They want me to use real water in the eyewash scene. So? I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eyedropper. So, Andy, you saw how to use this? You step on the pedal. Water squirts in your eyes. Carla! Carla! It is time for a little "T" and "A." I give you Toby and Angela. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Okay, it's your turn. Well, Angela is the winner. Yes. Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman? Yes, I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything. Is she a gambler? In a way, but not in a stand-up-and-cheer kind of way - like the song. - Mm. That is sad. Andy, if you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm gonna call every production in Northeastern Pennsylvania. You won't even make an appearance on a security camera. What's the holdup here? The actor's crying. Oh, God. She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't. Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older male lab assistant number one. You believe in me? I believe I want to go home. Yeah! Okay. Beat that. Whoo! - Okay. - Damn it! Damn it! God sorry. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. - Okay. - I got mad. - Yeah. - 'Cause I don't like losing, Pete. I just gotta Sorry, I'm mad, Pete. I'm mad. I'm really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money. I was gonna buy you a sweater. So this is stupid. It's just the whole contest is stupid, - so it feels - Oh! - Sorry, I'm mad. - Okay. I don't like losing. I thought I was going to win. Okay, hey, hey, hey. Sorry. Sorry. I'm gonna go upstairs and just Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting. Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more, so let me just put this in my calendar. I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar. Thank you. Your mom is a treasure. Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant Sorry, it's work. Hold on one second. Hey, Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good. To speak my truth, I'd appreciate it if you hung that up, 'cause we were in the middle of a conversation. I appreciate the sacrifice. Okay, to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair. Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth? I guess I will swallow my truth. Are you guys high? Because, if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds. We're not high. I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so blocked up. The Mark 47 is ready for launch. Less paste. Here we go. Rolling and action. And cut. We can fix the sound in post. - Yeah. - I can do a better one. That's fine. We'll move on. I said I can do a better one. - Darryl. - Action. Kid can act. Yeah. Yeah. Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes. After you. Thank you. Oh, God. Angela's first throw terrible. Dwight. Oh! Oh, man! It slipped out of my hand. What a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. Okay? Okay. All right. Don't you dare tank this. And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone, because this is over. I know a guy who can turn that into $800. And it's me. Well, I guess you needed the money more than me, huh? Use it wisely. I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity, and I don't need charity. I have my dignity, and that's enough. And, as long as I have that, I'll be okay. I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go, but let's keep at this. - Okay? - Okay. Jim! Thanks. - All right, have a good trip. Bye - Bye. Hey. I "Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Love never fails. And now these three remain faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love." - I love you. - I love you.
I'm taking some time off from work well, my other work because we needed it. It's great. The phone's been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts. But that doesn't matter. This does. It's the only thing that matters. We've had some really nice days together. Mm-hmm. Nice morning, too. Beesly. Oh, my God. Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial. Ah. Definitely blue. Totally, right? So, big tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond? For now, yeah, yeah. I was just spreading myself way too thin Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on. Uh, well, it took me a while. But I finally realized that I can't give 100% to two things at once, you know? Yeah. Tell me about it. I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time, I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup. Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything, so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing. Is everything okay? No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats. Wait, all of them? Two sacks' worth. Apparently, my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Philip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house. That's that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry. It's the bitch that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type. I've never met anyone like that. And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone. Angela, you still have your son. I guess. Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. Basher, thrasher, crasher, and Smasher. "Smasher"? No. Where'd you get that? Fireball. Cut! This morning, after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers, I earned my black belt in goju ryu martial arts. I had to find a new dojo after Sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, Sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out Sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt. I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided. - Fireball! - Ahh! That's how it's done. That's pretty good. I feel safe. Hey, Erin. Is Andy in? Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I-I thought you said "is Indian?" And I was like, "is Indian what?" Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes to all three, by the way. Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic. Yes. There's Andy. Andy is in. I'm a good receptionist. I know he's in. David Walrus in his native habitat. Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk? Yeah. This isn't gonna be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away for three months to the Caribbean. Then last week, he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, "the kind that's good for head shots. " And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it's going to boost office morale. Now, he's a good guy. But honestly, at a certain point, the ice gets too thin, and you fall through. And that is when you get fired. - Andy. - I'm gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream. Uh-huh. But Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking, or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I'll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense. So you think you've been too focused on your job? At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany. So you you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting? Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing. Could be dancing. I don't it just I owe it to myself and my future fans. Uh, well, I guess I can't stand in the way of a man's dream. And it seems like you have the gift. Thank you, David. There's probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, huh? Nope. I have made up my mind. I'm really sorry. Well, good luck. Hey, thank you. Not gonna need it. Okay. Well, that kind of worked out. I think just about anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole. Oh. Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise. So I was wondering if maybe I could have my desk back. Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So I kind of feel like I've earned this. - I mean, you know? - You totally have. You have earned it. But maybe I could be with my wife. It's kind of the whole reason why I'm here. Right. Well, I'm here to sell paper. - Burn. - Wow. All right, Jim, look. I just got made junior salesman. Right? And and Wallace is here today. And I don't want him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a a second second job here? It's okay. You can sit in the annex. - What? - I'll come visit you. Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk, if that's okay with you. It's fine with me. Have fun. But be careful. It is very easy to get lost in Pete's beautiful, dead eyes. Everyone, a little breaking news for you. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin forever. I can't say we didn't see it coming, but it's a sad day when anybody is fired. We're so sorry, Andy. Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired. I wasn't fired. What are you talking about? I'm fired up. Yes. Guys, I'm I'm leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous. Oh, Andy. Yeah, so I'll see you on the red carpet. 'Cause see, that's how it works. Andy sings beautifully, and he's really good at dancing. He's a good speaker. But there's just something there you don't want to look at. Hey, how am I doing it as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark. Yeah, a little bit. Oh, wow. But, um oh, I get that Oh, no, no. No, it's cool. - I get it. - It's cool, man. I'm sure you and I will have our own thing. Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right? You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that. I just think you're going into this a little fast. I'm 38, Darryl. How much slower should I go? Show business is cold. Let's say you get a job, which you probably won't. They're not gonna cut you any slack. You're meant for a job with lots and lots of slack. All right. I get it. The male is a funny species. We don't just tell each other how we feel. That's chick stuff. So instead of saying, "hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don't want you to leave," you say something like, "hey, Andy, you're making the worst mistake of your life. You're not talented. " Well right back at you, Darryl. I'm gonna miss you, too. Mmm! Andy's from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack? Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird in the park that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to, 'cause the park is free. - Hyuh! Hyah! - Hyuh! Hyah! I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts. He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts. It's not a large room. I think they heard me. Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. That's really okay. I'm mostly focused on the belt here. Just slip it off my slip it off my hips. Hold it take a step back. Take a step back. Okay, okay, I can't I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off. He will now perform the ceremonial cutting off of the belt. He oh. Gah! Hyah! Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a Baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. I felt like I was flying. There it is. - Congratulations. - We did it, we did it. - I love you. - Okay. Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. - You're going to watch me, right? - Yes, I will. - Sensei, you're not watching. - Yeah, I'm watching. Just do it. Ho! Ha! - Watching? - I'm watching. Watch this part, okay? Huh, gah! Gah! - Ha, ha, whoo. - Oh! Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this? Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world. He said that? - He's an odd guy, isn't he? - Yes. Irritating? Also yes. But I've got to hand it to him, he is one of the most tenacious and determined men I've ever met. Hyuah! Hah! Hut! Ha ah! Unh! Kyah! Ha! Ahah! Aah! Oh! I am so proud of you, schrooberry blue. I really felt like I almost lost her. And and nothing is worth that. Well, I tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn't even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage, let alone their professional goals. Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to "hang out with Pam. " You did not just say that. You don't know Pam. She is really cool. All I'm saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager's chair. And I thought you wanted that job. Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager. So the reason I called you in here is because Andy is moving on. Again. And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy? Not at all. It should be Dwight. You sure? You're going to want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, - but, uh - Yeah. Hey, if there's someone who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person. Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word. It's now or never. Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business in your late 30s with no savings to fall back on and no real connections in that business, which can be competitive. Yeah, sure. What's your question? Our question is it seems dumb. Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right? Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and "full-ass" it? - Yeah. - Um, really give it a go? Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way, achieve the fame and immortality that you seek? Hmm? Nah. I like my plan better. Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead, and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor. What? No, I don't think he can make it as an actor. But he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so, you know, why not go nuts with it? Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies? Yes. Yeah. I seem to have a sticky note emergency, where I grab it on the wrong end, and then, this happens. Oh, boy, um If you could help me out, that would be - I could give you some beginner stickies? - Anything would help. Thank you. - Okay. Here you go. Oh, also, while you're at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks, and some aspirin, that'd be great. - Oh, wow. You have that. - Mm-hmm. - Wow, that's - It's all yours. You come so prepared. Aspirin. If you want to get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that. Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great. Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job? No. He was maybe thinking of you for it. Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying. - Hello. - Well, hello. Big day for you. - Big day for you. - Thank you. - Love the belt. - Oh, yes. You know, I don't know anything about karate, but I have broken a few boards in my day. Hi-yah. Diving boards at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but nard-dog's outta here, so lettin' it all hang out. This is exciting. You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings. Thank you. I appreciate that. 'Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it. Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who try to be a star. But listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off, and pursue your dream, and have some fun, right? No, I just applied for more overdraft protection. Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years. I have seen you perform. Dear God, don't quit your day job. Nothing is impossible to him who will try. Alexander the Great, if he were Cockney. You're bad. I'm gonna make it. Every person who's been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person. Erin. Honest Erin. Cannot tell a lie. - Oh. - We lay together. That's something you can't take back. So true. Is there a question, or are what? Will you tell me bluntly? Do you think I'm making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor? Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless or maybe even starve. Thank you. You can stay on as a salesman, Andy. Thank you. Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please? - Say it again. - Will you be the new manager? Where? - Where? - What branch? Here. Scranton. Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news. I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun. What? But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute Manager. Why do you already have this? In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David. I know. I will never, ever let you down. I know, Dwight. I know. Okay. Okay. All righty. You're gonna do great. - Hey. - Wow, hey. Hi. What's up? - Um, I have a question. - Okay. Oh, I had a question. Really? - I did! - Yeah, totally you did. Super important. I need you to stay right here while you think about it. - Okay. - All right? I'm gonna wait. All right. I did not come back here just to see you. No, I'm sure you did not. What was your question? I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out. Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I'm waiting. Exactly. Hey, everybody. I changed my mind. Not leaving. I'm gonna stay on in sales. Oh, thank God because sales could be your best role yet. Hey. Good choice, man. Seriously. Don't wanna see you in a porn next year. Okay. Ooh, there's a great play about a salesman. Death of a Salesman. I don't think so. Sure,Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller. It's a great play about crushed dreams. Mm, no, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants. Got any hot leads? See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. Now, the staple crimps outward. I had no idea. And here, I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep. - Look who's back. - I'm back. Oh! Hey, look, and now, it's like a double date. Wow. 'Cause, uh bop, bop. Tweedle-lee-doo. Actually, maybe we should go on a double date sometime. That'd be fun. Yeah, we should do that for real sometime. Well, how about Thursday? Oh, well, Thursday's tough because Weeknights are actually tough just because They are. That's true, yeah. Just forget it. - Forget I said anything. - Oh. Attention, everyone. Just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. - Dwight Schrute - David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement? And then, I'll never, ever do it again. - I don't think so. - But it's just one thing. - Just let me let me do this - Dwight Dwight Dwight. Come on what I was about to say is Dwight Oh. I- I'm sorry, I gotta this'll be a second, sorry. Just wait and send it to voice mail. Yeah. Come on. Then we'll get him a new set of drums. Oh, my God. Dwight Schrute is manager! Oh, yeah! Whoo! Brava. Brava. - Way to go, Dwight. - Whoo! Creed Bratton is the new manager! Congrats. - What's going on? - Dwight's the new manager. He freaking did it. Congratulations, Dwight. Pam. Congratulations, buddy. Thank you, Jim. Congrats, Dwight. Get out of Jim's seat. Wha but I fought for this seat. You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen. We'll see. Give it a couple years. Scram. It's nice to have you back. - So - So I wanted to offer you a new position. Let's hear it. Assistant regional manager. Nope. Can't accept that job. - It's not a real job. - Jim. I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job, and one I'd be proud to take. Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot. Don't get me wrong. I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus. So all the numbers adding up? Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but congratulations, Dwight. Thank you. Ahem. Yes, congratulations. Yeah, and, Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations. This is a big day for you. Hmm. Yes, it is. Carry on. How did I just abandon my dream so quickly? It's 'cause I had a fallback. That's the problem. When you have fallbacks, it's just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats so they could never return home. Huge dick move, but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself. Everyone! - Changed my mind again. - Which is it now? - Dream or no dream? - Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in. Ain't that right, Jim? Oh, don't look at me, 'cause I think you're making a terrible choice. All in! Whoo! Toby! Hey. I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all. - Okay, then, Andy. - Yeah. But here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on, or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners. A- Andy, you know I can't do that. - It'd be lying. - Seriously? - Yeah, I'm - Come on, just do it. - I can't. - All right, fine. Just know that you made me do this. Oh, come on. Andy, no. God, Toby, don't stop blocking my hand. No, no. This is your you brought this on. No, no. Andy. Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood! This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem, it's clearly on your end. And oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then, um what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey. No, you are out of line, Miss Polodnikovski. No. No, you are. No, you are! Evicted? Fine! I don't want to live in that cesspool anyway. Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. Ye That is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin, Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike. You are disgusting! What do you think that was about? David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite. We put the past behind us, though, Andy. When have I told you I hate you and this company? Enough, Andy. Enough! Just stop forgiving me, David. Please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car? Oh, my God. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. " I think she's right. - I feel calm now. - Get out! Get out! I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing. - Andy. - Yeah. What are you doing? Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it won't squash my knickety-knacks on top. Yeah, okay, that's not what I mean. You don't have to leave because you said you would. Don't let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It's not worth it. Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly, I think about it a lot too Ugh. But I just it's in the past. - And I feel like we shouldn't - No, that's not - Rehash - No, none no, stop. It's just - Exactly. - Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy. Thanks, Angela. You too. Thanks. A- bridge a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelei and I would like to say thank you and good-bye the only way we know how. - Oh, good lord. - Can't you just leave? You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice good-bye. Tuna, I'm a performer, and perform I shall.  I will remember you   Will you remember me?   Don't let your life   pass you by   and weep not for the memories   Remember all the good times   that we had   I let them slip away from us   when things got bad   How clearly I first saw you   smilin' in the sun   Want to feel your warmth upon me   I wanna be the one   I will remember you  You okay? It's just a really nice song.  Will you remember me?   Don't let your life   pass you by   and weep not for the memories   Don't let your life   pass you by   and weep not for the memories  Awesome. Nice! Thanks, Meredith. - Mm. - Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. - He's not terrible. - Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time, like Lil' Romeo. No, he's good. Hewasgood. - Good night, Kevin. - Night, Oscar. Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar. Well, I've changed my mind. Wait a minute, Angela. You're not thinking of living in a tent Oh, God, would you just mind your own business? Okay, listen. I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent. - Oh, God. - Come stay with me. You don't want me at your place. I do. Yes. Not forever, but u-until you get back on your feet, which won't be long. It's the least I can do. Well Separate bathrooms. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's go get Philip. - Then, we'll get your stuff - Okay. And you get the hell out of that place. Okay. Are you allowed to have pets? Oh, Angela. Yesterday, I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. Ah! It really is amazing how your life can change in one day. You talk to Wade and Colin? No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up? We got an offer on the table. - What kind of offer? - A buyout. - What? - We're in play, baby. - Oh, my God. - We did it. - We did it! - Ah, ha, ha, ha, ho! Hey, and look. The buyers wanna make sure it's not just a Philly play. - Okay. - So get this. They're gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking spurs, the jazz, cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby. - Wow, that is - Yeah. - Wow. - We did it. Yeah, we did it. Hey, how long how long do we think that's gonna take? Wade said we could do the whole country in three months. Oh, man. Yeah, I can't do it. Can't do what? This, man. I- I can't do this to Pam. No, no. Jim, this is different. This is everything. I know. And I and I can't do it. So is your place all bachelor, slobby, and gross? Nope, it's neat and tastefully appointed like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up. I wouldn't know. I never lived with a gay guy. Angela, you just were I love him. I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You you can't c No, not the Senator. I love Dwight.
"The tea in Nepal is very hot. " "But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. " Last week, I finally became permanent Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton! My first project: Increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they're protecting America's real treasure Paper! Every morning, I email the day's security codes. Something that's been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It's not the KGB, but it's a start. "The tea in Nepal is very hot. " "But the coffee in Peru is far hotter. " Close. This is Tuesday, right? The The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter? Colder. - "The coffee in Paraguay is colder?" - No, I meant you were getting colder. The correct response is; "The coffee in Peru is much hotter. " - Oh, much. Okay. - But that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. - No. - Unless you want me to break protocol. No, no. Give me the steam. It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd! Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol! Oh, I'm saving a fortune on dry-cleaning. Mama. Angela, someone wants you. Okay. Coming. Hi, baby. Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that now it's Angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o. Saddle shoes with denim? I will literally call child protective services. Go get 'em, honey. Oh, don't worry. They'll get got. Manager of Dunder Mifflin. Check! Owner of a 1,600-acre beet farm. Check! Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid. Check on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring. Hi. Good morning. Name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that's premiering tonight. Also killed it in local theater, and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick. Okay. Thanks. - Go ahead and get in the back of the line. - Yes! Well, I burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American idol by winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation on channel TBD. It's a really cool show. It's like a total reinvention of the whole American Idol/Voice/Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean. Sales form for you to sign. You know what to do. Okay. Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best. Aw, thanks, man. Once upon a time, we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences, - much like Germany and Italy in World War - No. Good call. Together, we run a no-nonsense office. Preconference room meeting with Dwight went really well. Oh. Bodes well for the post-conference room meeting. All depends on the conference room meeting itself. Uh, okay. - Is that them again? - Yeah. Maybe you should call back. I will. I will. The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three-month road show thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that's final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I'm not risking that again. When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim. Welcome. He welcomes you. Please take an agenda item. - Your agenda-taking pleases him. - Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. "Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try. " "That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. " - Jim, over to you. - Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, "Michael J. Fax from fax to the future!" Okay? That's nonsense. - Question. - Yes, beautiful girl in the front. We are expecting a water delivery today at 10 a. m. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, "nice jugs!" That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office? - Zero. - No nonsense. - No. Can't have nonsense. - What is going on? Daycare won't take Phillip anymore. Why? Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi. Hi, buddy. Okay. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us at the office today. Gotta write that down. Okay, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited? I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap. Over the course of this documentary, I've had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble. My wife did it. I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary, so you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow or a minute extra for the rest of the month. Ooh! Announcement. Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those who saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions. I can't believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe. This airs tonight? Oh, my God. If my parents see this, I am toast. This is really huge. This is like the march on Washington, but for a singing show. Whoohoo! Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here and sang I Dreamed a Dream from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic. Whoohoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! - Whoa. -  Doctor, doctor, gimme the news   I got a great Casey Dean for you  - No. No, this is my time! - America wants it! You don't belt on my time! - I belt on my time! -  Casey Deeeeee-eeean  Casey De-ee-ee-ee-ee-ean  - Man, those are some nice pipes! - Yeah. What's your name? Andy. What's yours? - Why didn't you pack the apple snacks? - Why didn't you pack the apple snacks? - Guys. - Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong. - Guys. - Why don't you pack it? - Guys. - Kevin, what? - Kevin, what is it? Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says "bold front" instead of "cold front"? It's insane. Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks. Seriously, Kevin. - I'm just gonna have to go to the store. - Okay, you go to the store. Phillip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip. Not now! Private time! I love Star Wars as much as the next guy - Hey, hey. Seriously? My God, I'm so sorry. Well, this might make up for it. I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN. Which is, of course? - Potential future nonsense. - Yes. Good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up. Shut the door. Break it down for me. I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. - You've got a regional manager. - The power source. Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager. A loyal but bungling apostle. But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager? Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore. Exactly. I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable? Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests. I like the sound of that. - Who did you have in mind? - Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table? That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard. - What are you listening to? - Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note.  A 440 - Oh, sweet. - A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch. What's up, everybody? And welcome to America's Next A Cappella Sensation! Oh, my God! You're gorgeous! Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for 30 seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole! There's a mole? Oops. I'm not supposed to not supposed to say that. All right. No mole. Forget I said it, all right? What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it. Good man right there. I'll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right? Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me! What? - On a roll much? - I don't know where it came from. - That was amazing, man! - Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny. Yeah, you made a personal connection with him. - I did. I felt it. - Big time. What are you so excited about? - Nothing. - What are you up to? Members of the office, hear ye. That means ye, Plop. "Plop"? Still? We owe Andy that much. - Absolutely, we do. - Am I right, people? - Fine. - Today, we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager. - Aw, heck, yeah. - Nice. You'll always have the upper hand when you've got a good "aarm. " - Trademark pending. - This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corn dog, but that's for fueling only. - No savoring. - Wow. What an honor. - God, I envy them. - He envies you. You don't need to repeat right now - All right. - What I'm saying. By 2:00, Dwight will choose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me. What's up? What's going on? How was the "delivery"? Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I'm here. I hate good-byes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old "Irish Exit. " Just slipped out with making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all. A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now? Uh, two. Not even close, Meredith. - Come on! - Okay. Pam. What song is running through my head right now? The theme song from Saved by the Bell. Oh, my God! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World. Wait. No, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job. That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing? A horse. Ew, the exact opposite, actually. What's the opposite of a horse? - Come on. It's sea horse. - A sea horse. Whoa, how did you know that I was gonna Say that? Uncanny. Challenge number two, protocol. - Clark! - Yeah. Do you want a corn dog? - I would love a corn dog. - We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message. "Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri big nose went. " No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations. Uncanny. I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they'll feel like anything is possible. Great. More screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes Gaga for you. Oh, over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids. - What? - Yeah. Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit or is it a show about singing? I don't know, but I'm getting really worried here. Me too. - Hold my place in line. - Where are you going? They want feel-good stories? Wait till they get a good feel of me. - Thanks, man. - Thank you. Yep. Take care. - Darryl, hey. - Hey. Cool. Are you coming back to say hi? No, no. I'm not here, actually. These doughnuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn't say good-bye to. Aha! - How's Athlead? - We livin' like rock stars. I'm about to eat free steak with my sports heroes in 32 different cities. - Wow. - Jim really doesn't want to come? - He says he doesn't want to. - Wow. Man. I hope he doesn't regret it. Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin. Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin? That's what he says. If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then. An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity, but an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, - am I right? - A thousand times more. - I'll try this one. - Phyllis. Grab both these coffees, double fist it, - and head through this obstacle course. - Okay. Ooh, it's hot. Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. Okay. And go ahead. Oh, God, nice. She's through the green, everybody. - Here comes yellow. - No, no, no, no. - A real doozy. - Oh, boy. Phyllis, seriously? - Look at that form. - Oh, my God, that's just pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! Wow. Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ow! My skin! Ow! Ow! Aah! It burns! Aah! Aah! Aah! Uncanny. Darryl? Darryl! - Oh! - Oh, hey! Hey, what's up, y'all? You left us without saying good-bye! Oh. My bad. Good-bye, everybody. - No, that is totally uncool! - Hey, no way! Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. - Get upstairs. - I don't think I should Get upstairs, mister! - Yeah! - Right now! So, I'm going upstairs. You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing, none of these people are good enough. I know. What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet it might be the most logical thing I've ever said. Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise, but I know exactly what you were gonna say. The only possible assistant to my assistant Is Me. The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is - Dwight K. Schrute. - Yes! Thank you. I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no man. Wait. - That's it. - Okay. You look really, really good. Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right? Hey. - Hey. - You all right? What's going on? Are you happy? Yes, I'm happy. No, I know that you're, like, happy, and, like, you had fun today. - Yeah. - And that was fun. But what about a year from now? - What? - What about five years from now? - Pam. - Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much. This was my decision, not yours. - Okay. I kind of forced you to do it. - You didn't force me. - You did not force me to do this. - Yes, I did. - I don't know how else to tell you. - I'm afraid you're gonna resent me, - and I'm afraid that - Resent you? This is not enough for you, and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you. Is that really what you think? Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so you know what? I know it's against the rules, but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys. Okay. You got it, man. I didn't realize we were this close. We're all a little hormonal with the doc airing. Are you gonna come to poor Richard's and watch with us tonight? Uh yeah. Depending on traffic. - He ain't coming. - Oh, God! These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck. - Well, it's been great. - 11 years. A guy is in your life for 11 years, and then he's gone for who knows how long. Maybe forever. Anyhow Did we ever have lunch together, just just the two of us? You know what, I'm gonna make reservations right now - at Cugino's. - Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to zeppelin in my van? Oh, oh, I'm sure we did. Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl. Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours, and just see what we get. Listen, guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl's next I will go watch an eHow video on how to use excel, - and then we'll get this started. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here, and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you 'cause you're feeling sentimental. - You have to! - Come on! Hey, hey, hey. I'll do one thing with y'all. Which thing? I don't care. Choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though. Kevin, Kevin. Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. Kevin, could you not do that? What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work. - Here, use my pen. - Don't tell me what to do! - Shh! - No, I don't need this. And you obviously don't need me. - Kevin, where are you going? - Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true. He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper. I know, earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond. Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond. Hey, what's going on over here, some sort of singing competition for the young'uns? You're back. - No, it's me, Andy. - No, I know. No, no, no, I'm wearing makeup. You did a really great job. - You even look shorter. - Oh, I took out my lifts. - Oh. - Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height. Oh. All day long, it's moo the cows and cluck the hens. - Mm-hmm. - Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs. Oink the pigs, that is very important. Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight? The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm. - Thank you, Esther. - Bye. You threw the summoning bag at me, sir? I need you to perform a test. - Perform a test. - On an innocent baby. Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately, I have a lot on my plate today, so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But don't worry, he's the best in the biz. - Damn straight. - Unless you think he can't handle it. - Hey, he can handle it. - All right. Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley's sleeping. You don't want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you? I heard that. Mama. Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps. He does have a gift. Well, he's calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. - Careful, he bites. - Mama. Okay. You ever been in a manager's office before? Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called "Schrute or Consequences. " You're gonna choose one of these two things, a check for a million dollars or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet? Beet. Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child, are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes. Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions. - Oh, come on. - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? But thanks for coming out and please be sure to watch America's Next A Cappella Sensa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't do that. - Yeah - You can't do that. We've all been waiting! Okay. I am going in there. Don't - No, you're not, sir. - Don't don't - Please don't. - Don't touch me. I'm not touching you. Okay. No! - Run, old man! Run! - Ow. Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don't you dare. Don't get I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I'm Casey Dean! You'll be seeing the last of me! Or I meant you won't be seeing the last of me! Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple. That's because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience - of a real human breast. - Come on. He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.  I am beautiful  no matter what they say   Yes, words can't bring me down  -  Whoa-oh-no - Hi. - You're still here. Oh, thank God. -  I am beautiful Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You're, like, my three favorite people ever. - Excuse me, what is this? - Sweetheart, you're amazing, okay? You're obviously gonna be on the show. So it's someone else's turn now. Yeah. Go ahead, all right? Um My name is Ezra Cornell and I'm just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart. No, you're a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on. Busted. Got it. Yes, all right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing. I respect that. We do not want to hear you sing. Gabriella was our last audition. - Thank you. Good-bye. - Nope! Can't end like this. Slept in my car last night. Quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss's car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern. - Ugh, flag on the play. - That's that's what Yeah. Okay, all right, well, here's the song.  Far above Cayuga's waters  with her waves so blue  stands our noble Alma Mater  What is this song? Are you insane? It's the Cornell fight song. Listen, all right, thank you very much. We're not interested. You didn't let me finish. That's not fair. Look, man, you're not terrible but we've heard a lot of really good singers today, and you're just not good enough. Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that's the show. - Let me try a different song, okay? - Can he do this?  Hey, hobo man, hey, Dapper Dan   You both got your style  but, brother, you're never fully dressed   Without a smile Yeah.  Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly  Look, you gotta go. You can't just sit here and cry. Oh, I can so just sit here and cry! Thank you. Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy? Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored? Okay, I guess, it's just that Phillip got you something. Yeah, a $25 gift card. - iTunes. - I think there's, like, $7 left. It's just his way of saying; "Thanks for letting me hang out in accounting. " - Phillip got this for me? - Sure. That was a really cool move. Would you like to hold Phillip? Yeah. That's Kevin. - Whoa. - Easy. What a chubbers. - Whoa. - Okay. Okay. - I'm losing my balance. Whoa. - Now, Kevin No. - Hey, no. - No horseplay. - Stop it. You want to play with the cactus? - No. - No, no. So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we're gonna be best friends. He's a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you. We have our decision. You chose one thing. We want to dance with you. - You want to dance? - One dance. All of us together. This is what you want? - Yeah. - Absolutely. Better get some decent speakers up here then, 'cause we're gonna do this right. Yes! Yeah! - Whoo! - Whoo-hoo! Hey. You wanted to see me? Door. Chair. - It's about Phillip. - I'm sorry he's here today. - But I had - I believe that that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal. How thoughtful. Then the two of you would move to my is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet. If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son. Very well. - Can I go back to my desk now? - Yes. What's this? Well, I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so I needed a little help. Jim, I need my assistant to the regional manager, code red. Okay, I don't have my pocket code chart on me right now, so Now. I have an assistant now who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip. Jim, I'm not kidding. I need you. Go ahead. Okay, um, this is I'll be right back. What do we got? I was thinking of proposing to Esther today. Wow! Congratulations. That's a really big step, man. She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful. Genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me. My family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines, and isn't technically incest. Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy. Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm. - That's a lot of pros. - And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs. It all adds up. So what is the problem? Angela. I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew. Every instinct, every rational calculation. Some sort of virus? Love. Oh.  The anger swells in my guts   And I won't feel these slices and cuts   I want so much to open your eyes   'Cause I need you  to look into mine  Tell me that you'll open your eyes   Tell me that you'll open your eyes  I'm in love with you. What?  Tell me that you'll open your eyes   Tell me that you'll open your eyes   Get up, get out Dwight, listen, no matter what happens, you got to forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have. You're a good assistant, Jim. Not as good as you. That's very true. - Get the hell out of here. - You got it. I was just, um, checking out my present. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside. Oh, my God! - The yearbook picture! - Yes. That's incredible. Is this the boggle timer? I didn't think you were gonna get that one. - I really didn't. - Oh, no! This is, like, the best present ever. Okay, wait. What is this? A mini golf pencil that you threw at me. Like, three years ago. You saved this? - Yes, I did. - Oh, my God.  And I won't waste a minute without you  You watched it. Yeah. Well, then I guess you're ready for this. - What's that? - It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know is in that note. Not "enough" for me? You are everything. Thank you. - Okay. Ready everybody? - Hit it, red!  Dance  boogie wonderland  Dance  boogie wonderland  midnight creeps so slowly   Into hearts  of men who need more than they get   Daylight deals a bad hand   To a woman  who has made too many bets   The mirror stares you in the face   And says, baby, uh-uh, it don't work   You say your prayers  though you don't care  You dance and shake the hurt   Dance  boogie wonderland  Dance  boogie wonderland I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I'm gonna miss these guys. Okay, I've got my - See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right? - All right, Meredith. - Okay, bye. - See you there. Listen, I - Bye, Phillip. High five. Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother's, and I'll meet you at poor Richard's in an hour. Are you sure you don't want me to drop him off? She doesn't know I'm living with a straight woman. I don't want to get her hopes up. All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye. Oh, my goodness. Pull over! Dwight? Move to the side of the road! - Why? - Pull over! What do you Dwight! Dwight, what the fuck is your problem? - Shut up, woman! - Who drives like that? Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son! I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means I can be with you! Can you put that down? This expresses how loudly I love you! It's too loud. This is a ring taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the Gangster Patriarch of the Coors Dynasty, melted in a foundry run by mennonites. Okay. Yes. Yes, I will! - I love you. - I love you! - And I lied to you. - What? Phillip's your son. What? Why would you say that I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me. Get out! I'm a dad! You're a dad! Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor's up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. Oh! You have to change the channel to PBS. - Yeah. - College baseball is on. But there's a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it. - What's it about? - A paper company. How many people want the game? - Yeah! - Yes! Who wants PBS? - Whoo! - Yes! Sorry. A tie means I do nothing. Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places. - One more for the doc. - Hey! - Yay, Andy! - - All right. Yes! Hey, how was the singing show audition? Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal. Okay. I feel scared a little. Yeah, I'm not ready for this. No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is. One thing we do know. Nothing will ever be the same. Here we go. All right, Jim, your quarterlies look very good. How are things going at the library? Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it, so So, you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? Uh, actually, you called me in here. All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
_ The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew? We're getting bonus footage for the DVD. Pfft. Nobody buys DVDs anymore. It'll be a pledge gift. PBS The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you. In the past year I've consolidated the entire Scranton paper market regained the White Pages, the district, the county, we supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon. And in the morning there's mini-reunion. A kind of "where are they now" panel at a local theater. It'll be nice to see everyone again. I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go. Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring. Yes. Whoo, whoo, whoo. Ah, I've been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old. - Speech! - No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is for Kevin. Yes! Wait, why? Go ahead and just read the frosting. - "Get out"? - Mm-hmm. What does that mean? It's a colloquial way of saying "you're fired," Kevin, - which you are. - What? Dwight you can't do that. The cake has spoken, Pam. Sorry! Heh. Well, if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying Dwight Based on his merit. Ooh. Um I'm good. Well, Toby'll stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, - Toby's blocked it, so - Yeah, yeah. - I don't think - Toby, wait, wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. Bye bye, Toby. At least I got chocolate. I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy, and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too. Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish Cultural Center. - Whoo! - Can you clap? Can you clap for mom? And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese. Angela, are you ready for the wedding? Yes. My heart is so open. I am so at peace. Look at Meredith. She's disgusting. Those feet they're like the paws of an orangutan. I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much. That is all. Have a good morning. - Thank you. - Thank you, Dwight. What was that for? To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful. Ah, I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone. D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me. Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him. I don't I don't know why. I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always liked Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band The Grass Roots in the 1960s. During that time, the police say, he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military. - Oh, some fudge? - Oh, thanks. I love your fudge. - Thanks. - Mm. I think I gained a couple pounds since I got here. Oh, you can afford it. After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But he'll get there. - Okay, the limo's gonna be here at 5:00. I need everybody to be ready 'cause I want to pack in a lot. Partytime whorehouse. Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay? Well, you're the bestisch mensch Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know, for over 12 years, I've done nothing but trick and prank him. But tonight only good surprises. "Guten pranken." Oh, hey, Jim, I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight. Great, now we got three hours to fill. Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up? Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had stopped sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing. Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him. Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? America's Next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say. You can't just sit here and cry. Oh, I can so just sit here and cry! Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it. Oh, don't. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don't be such a baby. Oh, no. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. For Weekend Update, I'm Seth Meyers. That's Baby Wawa. Good night. Bye. After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. Not really my scene. Years ago, the Senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you hold on. Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's all over the place. I don't know what it means. That's the reason Kevin got fired. It's his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a keleven. He told Dwight, "a mistake plus keleven gets you home by seven." He was home by 4:45 that day. Oh, I live in Poland now the Scranton of the EU. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone. Hello! Hello! - Oh. - Hi! - No. - Oh. How did you know my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me? Oh, no, no, no. My plane just got in. From New York. - Are you still with Piotr? - No. And I thought I unfriended you. Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab? After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know, 'cause they have to give you one month's notice before they leave. - Hey-oh! - Andy? - You're back? - Yeah. That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God! Hey, man, good to see you. Thank you. Yeah. - Andy. - Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly. Andy, I've been worried about you. How are you? - A little warm. - Poor, poor Andy. Okay. Aw. - Thank you, Phyllis. - Hello, hello. - Hey! - Dar-ryl! - Darryl! - Hey! Hey, what's up? Didn't I just see you at the airport - jumping in a limo? - What? Must've been another devilishly handsome, - debonair individual. - Hmm. Hey, man, how you doing? I, um I didn't call 'cause I figured you changed the number. No, I didn't change the number. All good, though. Phone never rings. What! Ohh! Surprise! I thought you guys couldn't come. Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend, and the doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet. Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I. "Guten prank" number one. You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town? - Uh, better ask Jim. - And Jim will say nothing. Darryl! - Andy! - Hey, Pam! Hey, Pam! How are you? We're fine. Yeah. And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. - Because why wouldn't you be? - Mm-hmm. Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time. I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, it's hot, the music is awesome. And the tacos are - for real. - Wow! That sounds incredible. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to. - Whoo, whoo, whoo! - Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy. - Yeah. - Ohh! - Aw! - Whoa-ho! Haven't been in one of these in forever! They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliche. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out. Wassuuuuup! Wait. Why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary. - Dwight. - Jim, what - Get out. - Come on!

He'll just get you on his cell phone, and then that'll go viral. - That happens a lot? - Yeah, I guess. But things are going well, actually. I spoke at Cornell during Commencement Week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke, but it was a huge success. Well, I bet it was a smash. That's how I got my new job in the admissions office. Is that a volunteer program or No. It's a job. Things are going great. - Let's get a drink in you, huh? - Yes! Whoo-hoo! Let's get this party started! Where's my angel? This is my big sister Rachel. No, this is my big sister Angela. We're very close. We even have our own special language. People love it. They do. Man, how long have we been sitting here? Hi, boys! - Ohh - Here we go! Oh, thank God. We are famished! Hey, did somebody order the chef special? - Right there. - Right here. No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special? I bet you boys have a big appetite. Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups. Mm, I know what you want. I knowexactlywhat you want. Yes, an onion loaf for the table. But that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. - What is it exactly? - Ooh. Shh. Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef special? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good. - Whoo! - What? - Okay. - Oh, boy. Oh! Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed, or cleaned or whatever. Angela's special repair man is here. Wait, what is this? Shut up. Jakey? - Mom? - Wait. Wait. - What? - Oh, man. No, no, no, no.

Stop it, Meredith! Fine. My bad! Go ahead, Jakey! Uh, no. It's o thank you. You know what? You don't have to oh! No, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay. Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic. Dwight, for the last time, she's not a waitress. You're telling me! If you want her to leave, just tip her. What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right? That was interesting. - What was that? - It's just the wind. - Will you lock the door? - Okay. It's just the wind, see? Nothing. All right, you know, you don't have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It's the wind. Just come and shut oh! My God! - Phyllis! - What's happening? Oh, man, never thought I'd say this, but I think I ate too much bone marrow. Oh, it's the girls. Hey, Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled. Good old Mose. They think it was Mose. Oh, great, he's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a braut entfuhrung. What is that? A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub. And when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah. All right! Oh, Mose! Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom to search for her, and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town? Right. Which one is that? Mm, hey, driver, why don't you take us to 3030 Adams? - Is that Mose? - Yes, it is! I am here for my bride! Well, first, buy us a drink.  if you want your bride, buy us a drink   if you want your bride, buy us a drink  Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! Well, well, well, well, well. That's six "wells." Did I get that number right, Dwight? I heard you bought a bar, Kevin. Yes. I did. This one. Now get out! - Why did you pick this place? - Ohh. You? You did this as a prank. My own bestisch mensch. Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet. Waste of a good hatchet. Okay, just talk. Well, w - I heard you say "well" the first time, I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him making his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day. It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job. You're just saying that to make me feel better. No, really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw out your computer. Is that all it was? That's it. Come here. I missed you, Kevin. - I missed you! - Ohh. - Guten prank. - Yes, Mose. Guten prank number three. You've had your drink. Now where is my bride? Mose! What Ohh, Mose. What the fuck is your problem, you fucking piece of shit? _ Hey, is Angela coming, or _ No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk. - Right. - Hey, guys. Stanley! - How's Florida? - Oh, great. Yes, I'm living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the Everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat, which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds. Am I the only one that's nervous? Heh heh. How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed? No, no, I'm fine. Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway. I guess this was worth being filmed nonstop for nine years. I'm sorry, guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.  Just sit here and cry, just sit here and cry   oh, I can so just sit here and cry   you guys are really mean   it can't end like this, you know   slept in my car last night, quit my job   burned all my bridges   and I did unspeakable things   you're just not good   you're just not good   are you insane?   You're just not good   you're just not good   chill out   just sit here and cry  People actually dance to this. It's in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy, though.  Cry, cry, cry  Yeah, people hate you. I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. Hey, it's Andy Bernard. Nard Dog! Roo-doo-doo-doo! Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo! Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo! Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo! Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo! Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo! How did it feel to see your lives played out on TV? It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it. With today's modern surveillance technology, we are in a constant state of being watched, whether it's our government or the government of other countries, AKA Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were. Uh, no one recognizes me. But now all my friends call me Plop. So thanks, PBS. Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we'd all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead? Well, I mean, how do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something. She pays me back every day, just by being my wife. So that's fine. Aww. O-kay. All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean, if I lucked into that, he could do anything anything. I'm sorry, is there a question? Uh, no. Pam, what was in that teapot letter? Oh, um, well, you know, I I just I think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself. I hear ya. What did it say? We're gonna move on. Next question, please. Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore? Yes. I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. - Was it accurate? - I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in school psychology, and they didn't show it. Yes, I was getting hammered. But, hey, it was college. I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia? Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully, from not communicating to being a little selfish. Listen, um I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't wanna risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong, because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year when it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger, and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end. And you're fine with that, because you just never, ever wanna leave it. Aww. LikeHarry Potter. Yeah, likeHarry Potter. I have a question for Erin. - Really? - Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother. Thank you. So my question is, um, do don't you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her. Maybe sometimes. But not like hate hate. More just like, "mom, I hate you!" And then she would say, "go to your room, young lady." And I'd stamp my foot and run upstairs. And I have a room, which is really cool. And then we'd just have dinner together. But I don't know. I'd have to meet her. Thanks. Erin Yes? Um Oh, Erin Yes? Is there a follow-up question? Mom? Aww. Erin same question, but about your dad? Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let's thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today. Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center, don't forget, Irish step dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic. - Where is the basket for gifts? - Right there, sir. Hi. I'm Dakota. Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark. - Nice. - My wife's name is Kathryn.

That is an amazing name. I'm obsessed with Drake. His last album, it just touched me to pieces. No, Kelly, he's not named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It's Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake. Cool. Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. - I'm obsessed with him. - Oh? Ravi is a pediatrician. And some of his patients are total uggos. They're called premature, sweetie. Yeah. It's good to see you again, Ryan. - Let me help you up. - Thanks. - Ooh! Oh! - Ow! Oh, boy, maybe your heels are too high. No, my heels aren't too high. It's because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. Ohh. Sorry, Phyllis. You didn't know. As long as I can get to the altar. Oh, I'm gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank. - You ready? - You kidding? I was born ready. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um I don't know how to tell you this, but we have a little bit of a problem. Oh, no. What? The minister just told me that it's tradition for the bestisch mensch to be older than the groom. Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing. I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out, because I'm significantly younger than you. Not significant is a big word. I think it's definitely well, okay. - Either way - I think you're only a teeny Either way, Dwight I can't be there for you. I'm sorry. Jim. I just really wish there was something I could do. Michael. I can't believe you came. That's what she said. Best prank ever. Yeah! As is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do. See, I get what they're trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow? Ugh. "Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle dove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice. For your voice is sweet, and your face is comely." I now pronounce you man and wife. - Bravo! - Bravo! Whoo! Release the doves! Ooh! Oh. That's Go. That's not Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed along the aisles. Just stab 'em on in there. - Agh! - You get it?  no Angela, I'll be there for ya   and when the storms scream Angela   Angela, I'll be there, yeah   oh, Angela   oh, Angela   when the winds cry Angela   Angela  Everybody.  Shout it, hey, here comes my girl   here comes my girl  See, now you don't owe me anything.  Yeah, she looks so right   she is all I need  Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. - And he's hot. - Oh, no. I was wondering, could you maybe examine him for a second? Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well, little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside? Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water. Are you sure you don't wanna go in? Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like, what you live for? - Just go, go! - Thank you, Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you. I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good. He'll be fine. I let him suck on a strawberry. He's allergic, but he'll get over it fast. I had to talk to you. You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? Mm. Mmm.  Sara smile  Michael has so many pictures of his kids, he had to get two phones with two numbers, and he pays two bills. Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed! He's just so happy to have a family plan. Where'd you learn to dance like that? I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing.  I'll meet you in the middle of a hurricane  Is it me? Is it Nellie? It's everything.  I'll meet you in the middle of a sad song   so free and easy  I missed you. I missed you too.  I'm excited just by touching your hand  Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson's a mean old grump. But would a grump make this? It's me. It's me.  I wanna run with you, fast as I can  - I love you. - I love you too. We're gonna be together forever. We're running off into the sunset. I finally mastered commitment.  I just wanna be your lover, ain't no liar   Rosalita, you're my stone desire   oh, yeah  What was that stuff? Hey, has anyone seen Ryan or Kelly? Ooh! Yes. Uh, they left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby, so they can start a new life together. Oh, that's it. Here. Call Child Services and report an abandoned baby. We'll find a better parent than Ryan in no time. Oh, I don't know. Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves. Hey. This is better. - Yes! It is. - Hi. - Oh, yes. - Hey. Yes, it is. Oh, yes, it is! If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to find me. We'll be somewhere in Europe. Won't we? I feel like all my kids grew up, and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream. - Thank you so much. - Good night. - Good luck. - Great. It was really fun. Good evening. The doc crew's throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight. Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. No offense. You going, Toby? Oh, I don't know. I might turn in early. It's only 6:00. - Come on, everybody's going. - You have to go, Toby. - Yeah, come on, Tobes. - Come on, Toby. - Come on! - Yeah, I'll stop by. There he is. - I need to get out of this dress. - I gotta get out of this dress. Oh, I'm sorry, Pam. What's going on? Why are you still here? I'm so sorry. They were an hour late. No, really, what's going on? Okay, okay. Um So this past year has been really great, and you've been great, and I just I know that you had to make this choice, and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer, then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way, and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture and show you all at once just how much I love you, and how much I really do believe in your future. Sorry, how long have you been showing the house? - About two months. - That's why it's so clean. Yeah. I mean, you were gonna do this without me? Well, you you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. Oh okay. Where would we go? Austin? Maybe. I promise you you don't have to do this for me. I'm doing it for us. - Okay. - The last - We'll take it. - Hold on one second. The last few months have meant the world to me. - And all I care about - Hold on a second. Wait, what did you just say? We wanna buy your house. - You wanna do this? - I wanna do this. - You really wanna do this? - I really wanna do this! Oh, my God. Hey, Darryl. What? Yeah. All right! We're so excited. Cool. Oh, that's for PBS executives only. I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this. I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I'd love to contribute to your campaign. Thank you, David. Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin. And I decided to paint the history of paper, which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it, and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best, because I think that I've painted the perfect thing, which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you, Jim. And go ahead! Everyone, let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just I kind of meant just everybody from the office. Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody. - Let's go outside. - Okay. Okay, I need a drink. Yeah, we all need a drink. What the there's only dandelion tea and raisins in here. Hey bottom drawer. Yes! - Oh, so - Mm-hmm. Right. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore. I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could've been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk, and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But it would just just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself, "Be strong. Trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want. And act fast, because life just isn't that long." If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural. Hey, guys. - Hi. - Hey! What about the honeymoon? Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again? Aw. J, P, and D. The three amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from our honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? What is that meaningful look? You know what? Maybe we should talk. Hey, come here. You guys need to see this. What is it? You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark, what will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn - I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing. Athleap. And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially No, don't say it. You're fired! - You're both fired! - Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note. Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best that I can do is one month for every year you've been here. That's the Max. Thanks, Dwight. Hey, and if you're ever in Austin Whoa. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No, thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay. In my barn. There it is. Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore. I have subordinates. So have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant, is now my wife. My top salesman Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding. And office administrator Pamela Beesly Halpert is my best friend. So yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates. You might feel sorry for me. But I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with me. Oh, I can so just sit here and cry. Oh, yes! You did good. Real good. Thanks, dad Darryl. I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell, and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. Someone should write a song about that. You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way and that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary, and you couldn't once show me doing my origami. Uh ohh!  I saw a friend today, it had been a while   and we forgot each other's names   but it didn't matter 'cause deep inside   the feeling still remained the same  Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's an amazing gift. Hey, Jim, remember Flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? - It was awesome. - Thanks, Phyl. I still have my medal from that. Do you even have a mattress? No, but I still have my medal from that. Oscar. Oscar. I think I'm gay. Why do you say that? It's just that I'm so emotional. Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay. - No, but maybe the reason - You're not gay.  And all the faces that I know   have that same familiar glow   I think I must have known them somewhere once before  How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how we made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work? Every day when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now? It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. Let's do this. I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they're the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You're not alone, sister. Let's get a beer sometime. I'm happy that this was all filmed, so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years, and I never wrote anything down. That was so much fun. Bye, Kev! I sold paper this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid wonderful boring amazing job. I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?
