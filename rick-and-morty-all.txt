Morty, you got to come on.  You got to come with me.  Rick, what's going on? I got a surprise for you, Morty. It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about? I got a surprise for you. Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard. I got a surprise for you, Morty. What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage. Yeah, Rick, it's great.  Is this the surprise?  Morty, I had to I had to I had to I had to make a bomb, Morty.  I had to create a bomb.  What?! A bomb?! We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty.  Create a whole fresh start.  Ttthat's absolutely crazy! Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica. Jessica? From my math class? When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam. And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and so that's the surprise, Morty. No, you can't! Jessica doesn't even know I exist. But but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity. II get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not you don't you don't got to worry about me trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm I'm not that kind of guy, Morty. What are you talking about, Rick? You you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she she's all for you, Morty. I don't care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You're right. Let's forget the girl all together. She she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways. Arming neutrino bomb. That's it that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. Get off of me, Morty! I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy. What's gotten into you? I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb What are you, crazy? person and just let you blow up the whole world. All right, all right. I'll I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden. We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the road here. Oh, thank God. You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive. It was? Sure. Why not? I don't know. You you know what, mo Neutrino bomb armed. Um Corrections by XhmikosR I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer? Oh, my God. His head is in his food.  I'm going to puke.  Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practicekiss the livingroom pillow. The dog sleeps on it. I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something. Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.  What?!  Dad? What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time? Damn it!  Jerry!  Beth! Oh, my God. My parents are so loud. I want to die. Mm, there is no God, summer. You got to rip that bandaid off now. You'll thank me later. Okay, with all due respect, Rick What am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for highconcept SciFi rigamarole? Listen, Jerry, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar. But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. Gguy up front says, "two plus two." The people in the back say, "four." Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them. Oh, dad. What? For real? All right, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math. And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in.  Two plus two.  Jessica. Five plus five. Tenssica. Okay, good. It's time for the quiz. Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room. There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00. Hi, Morty. Whoa! Hi, Jessica. Can I show these to you? Wow. Ththey're both great. Thank you. You know what I named these? My little morties. Uh, that's flattering and a little weird. Do you know what I want you to do with them? Rename them? Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around.  No wrong answers.  Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. Llet's give this a shot. Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me? Uh, II'm just doing my best. Morty! What are you doing to me?! Jessica. Morty! Jessica. Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad. JeJessica. Jessica. Not my fault this is happening. Well, well, well.  Uh, morning, Frank.  "Morning"? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family's poor? Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, yyou kind of had things handled without it. You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty. And now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich. There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands. Oh, geez, Rick. What'd you do to Frank? It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.  I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again. Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on! Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go. Oh, my God. I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky. This is the story we'll be telling our children. Hi, Frank. Aah!  Scalpel.  Scalpel. Knock, knock. Jerry? My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?" We're losing him. Okay, he's back. Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason. Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia. Losing him. Stabilized. Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.  Well, yeah, on horses.  Excuse me? Okay. Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way. Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nicelooking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home. We're losing him. Hey, Tom. We know when we're losing him. We can hear the beeps! There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go. Oh, geez. Okay. Oh, man, Rick. What is this place? It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about mega seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty. Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing. All right. All right. Calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, mmeeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be holy crap, Morty, run! I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty! Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Yyou smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline. All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now? Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? Look at it just lumbering around. It defies all logic that thing. Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. Tatatatatata. Morty, you see this? You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there? The mega trees? That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them. And that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school. All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an Under underfoot figure. Just take these shoes, Morty. They're special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together. Aah! You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on! I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's secret? I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son. Everything cool in here, Beth?  It's fine, Davin.  Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse. Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend. Well, maybe you're right. Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon? Horse heart surgeon. Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon? Morty, oh, you really ddid a number on your legs right now. You know, you got to turn the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze. I'm in a lot of pain, Rick. Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty? Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Yyyou're a monster. Yyou're like Hitler, but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something. Okay, hold on just a second, Morty. Ooh. Ohh. Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you. Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy? Sure thing, Rick. Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had brokenleg serum at every corner drugstore. The stuff was all over the place, Morty. Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick. There's just one problem, Morty one little hangup. The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. II was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty.  It's got no charge left.  What?! It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty. Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. Wwhat are we gonna do? II have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home? There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid. Uhoh. When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty. In my butt? Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit. Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that. Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Ththese seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty. And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Yyou've got to put these seeds inside your butt.  In my butt?  Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty. Oh, man. The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months. What? Why didn't you notify us? I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather? Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating? Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school. Summer? What kind of God lets this happen? We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them. The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. So, I told him, "give me the blimfarx," you know? This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency. It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like, that's what we eat on girvonesk. The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt. That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them. It's gonna be great, Morty. All kinds of science. Okay, next through. Except you. You go over there. Why does he have to go over there? Random check. He's got to go through the new machine. What new machine? It's a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt. Run, Morty! Run! Aah! Red alert! Ohhhhh! Hey! Ohhhhhh. Aah! Don't think about it! Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher. Whoooooo! Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I'm just trying to Aah! I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty.  Cover me.  Oh, man. I mean, you know, II don't want to shoot nobody. They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots! Aah! My leg is shot off! Glenn's bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children! They're not robots, Rick! It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here! Holy crap! This is insane! Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here! Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal? Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop. Just kidding.  You're Morty, right?  Yeah. You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass. Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Eindouche. What? I'm an angry father, not an improvisor. Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior. No? No takers? You guys should really not be touching that stuff.  It's beyond your reasoning.  You're beyond our reasoning! Takes one to know one. Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. What what are you guys doing with my stuff? We're moving you to a nursing home. A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun. Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas.  What does that mean?  It's personal. Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all. Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something? Oh, don't highroad us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes. III don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific? Oh, for crying out he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say? I do? Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard. Aw, geez, dad. Yyou know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once. Morty, ttell your parents the square root of pi. Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't. The square root of pi, Morty. Go! Whoa! What the hell? Holy crap. He's right. Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics. "The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart! But I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me. Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop. No, II understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school. Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication. Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! No idea what you're talking about. Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family. And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you. You know what? Okay. Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter. Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity. Aw, man. Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. Starting right about now. Ohh, man. Oh, geez! Ohh. I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times.

Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby. beautiful putt right there good birdie. That's only the eighth birdie of the day. What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? Outside? Are you kidding me?!  Come on!  Oh, my God.  What's wrong?  Your idiot dog! Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy. Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad! Morty, come on. I need your help tonight. Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you? I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty. Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rentfree and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!  Haha!  Aw, man! Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry. All right, ruffles What's his name? Snuffles. Snuffles, shake. Roll over. Go to the bathroom.  Holy crap!  No way. Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.  That was fantastic, Rick!  Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one. Wwwwhat is it? It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.  You talking about "Inception"?  That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense. "Inception" made sense. You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, yyou're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time. Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework? Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it. Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. Wwe're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me. You don't know me! Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice. Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes" You don't know me! Then let me get to know yo, damn it! Uhoh! Spoilers! I'm a full season behind. Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird. It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty. Wheat thins. Wheat thins. I'll take two. Oh, I think you've had enough, sir. You don't know me. All right, Morty, time to make our move. Make it bounce. No, you didn't. Oh, jiggle it now. You better stop with that. Allahu akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math! Hey! I said nobody move, buddy! The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you! Take cover, Morty! Ooh! Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches highschool math. I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty. But we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty. What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh! Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine! Now bring me my slippers. Now, be my footstool, snuffles. This is what I'm talking about.  This is a dog.  Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine. You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what. Oh, my God. He's trying to tell us something. That is so awesome. Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna". He's saying "I love Obama". So cute! I'm posting this online, like, right now. I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing? Hmm? Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk! Why would I negotiate with you? Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield. Mrs. Pancakes! Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking. Run! Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on! Hey, you don't know me! Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall  into a giant vat of lava!  Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out! You don't know m All right, let's go. Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird. Don't judge, Morty. Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up. Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch. Ooh, hey! Ooh, oh! Oh, man. Come and join us. I'm sorry. No, no.  Ooh, come here!  No, thanks! Ooh, wow!  Come over here, baby!  No, I'm okay. Whoa! Summer?! Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things? Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here. It's Summer! Aw, geez. Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister. Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an intergenerational sandwich. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake! This is disgusting!  I'm gonna puke!  I can't take it, Rick! Sexual hangups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads! Time to go another dream deep, Morty! What the hell? Why would Mr. goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick? Geez, I don't know, Morty. Whawhat do you want from me? Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!  Oh, here we go!  Holy crap! Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives. I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there? Snuffles fix. Make better. Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome! Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood. Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over. Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.  Why not?  I don't know. It's Indian giving. A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill. It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy. Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV. "A," "b" his name is scary Terry "C," "d" he's very scary Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! "E," "f" he'll design your death The little girl! Huh? "J," "k," he'll really ruin your day Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty. Oh, geez, Rick. Wwwhoa, this isn't good. Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch! Ohhhh! Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed! Where are my testicles, Summer? Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone? Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, snuffles. Do not call me that! "Snuffles" was my slave name. You shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white. Okay, snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me. Scaring you? Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund? Uhhh Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here? Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? No! No, we were uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to uh Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks! Yeah. Totally. Let's go. You will walk when it is time to walk. What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math? Oh, yeah. Buckle up, bitch! Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot! You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Hold on, Morty. Yyou know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide.  I say we try hiding.  But that's the opposite of what Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything? Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? III think it's a good idea, Rick. Worstcase scenario we're back to running. Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking. Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while. You can run But you can't hide! Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move. Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding. Dad, he wants to be called snowball. Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous. You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery. You think you can control me with a haircut? Hi, honey. You're home early.  How was your day?  I don't want to talk about it! Oh, of course.  You never want to talk about it.  Get off my back, bitch! Out there. Not in here. Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa. I love you, too, Terry. Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him. Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare. Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare scary Terry. Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants! Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch? Oh um "Bitch." Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Hey, leave him alone! Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants? Well, I never! II see no reason to stand here and take this. You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, yyou're perfectly scary enough as it is. Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool. Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say. You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg. You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip. Oh, hey, it's you guys! I haven't seen him this relaxed in years. If you guys ever need anything, just say the word. As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with. "Q," "r," you won't get very far I always hated that song! These halves don't belong together, bitch! Sex is sacred! This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch! Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an "A" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought. What the hell? Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty? Oh, man, what's going on? Well, it's possible that your dog became selfaware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty. I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart. This is why I choose to get C's. Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.  Dad!  Rick!  Oh, thank God, Morty.  Oh, you're welcome. All right, let's get out of here. If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it. It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right? Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time. See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them. Bad person. Bad. Ooh, great plan, Jerry. Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side. Ththanks, snuffles. Begin phase two. Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. Please! Please don't kill me! What's she saying, bill? I think she's saying, "I love lasagna." Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead! No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.  What?  It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream. But Iit's been like a whole year! It's been six hours. Dreams move one onehundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is oneseventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth. Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Look, ddddon't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these. Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. What?! It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg. It's pretty bad, emperor snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation. Anything. Anything for my precious Morty. Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom. To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness. Do you think they would have done this for us? We are not them! We are not them. Assemble the troops. I've made a decision. Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory. I'm gonna miss you, snowball. You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much. Jerry? I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller." Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it. Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick. I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed ininto a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, maymaybe they'll do it boarddriven. You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick. What do you know, Morty? What do you know? Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for scary class. My name is scary Mr. Johnson. Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say you can't learn anything until you learn how to chill. Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.
Corrections by XhmikosR  last king Christmas   last arrived   on the Christmas   Christmas  Mmm. Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham. Um, merry Christmas. Hello? My parents are coming over for the first time in years. Can we stow the gadgets and look alive? Alive? For your parents?  Mm, good one.  Hey, man! You "hey, man!" This holiday is about humanity. You know, I thought it was about being born halfGod or something. Whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking now. Dad, I'm not giving you my phone. Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook. Aho, ho, ho, everybody. More like "whoa, whoa, whoa." What is this? My parents are coming! Calm down, Jerry. This is Reuben, an old friend. Pearl harbor. I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation. Aww! Dad, that is so sweet! Yeah, it is. I don't get it. Korea. Don't worry about your Christmas, Jerry. I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise. Huh. You think you know a guy. Okay, there's my parents. Now, remember no TV, no phones, no laptops. We are connecting this Christmas, like oldschool Jews on a Saturday.  Hey, hey!  Merry Christmas, son. Uh, hi. Can I help you? Jerry, this is Jacob. Didn't you get our text message? No! You must be Jerry. That's a finelooking apron.  Williamssonoma?  I wish! But thank you. So, you're a friend of the family? Uh, the way we see it, he's a part of the family. Wow. After your father's brush with cancer and losing your Uncle, we looked at life and wondered, how have we spent it, and how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die a list of fears and questions or a collection of real experiences? Holy crap. Joyce, that's amazing. Then Jacob came into our lives, and we're learning to live again. All three of us. Cool.  Eggnog?  Now we are talking! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh? Hi, Joyce. Leonard.  Hello, there.  Merry Christmas, man. Morty, a moment of your time? He's in bad shape, Morty. Aw, geez, Rick. What'd you do? Gee, thanks, Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I'm sitting here trying to save the guy's life. I need your help. I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's going on. Uh, where where do I find Dr. Bloom? In Reuben.  Reuben, Minnesota?  Reuben on the table, Morty. Look, I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse. What proc  Hey, dad, where's Morty?  He's busy. Morty, can you hear me? Head north. Rick, where am I? Depending on my aim, you should be just South of the entrance. Entrance to what? Welcome, Morty. Welcome to anatomy park! It's a little business venture I've been cooking up on the side with Dr. Bloom an amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead. Oh, my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder falls? Pirates of the pancreas? You got a problem with that last one, Morty? Huh? No, no. I'm just reading 'em out loud in the order that I'm seeing 'em. Okay. All right. If I sounded a little defensive, it's because pirates of the pancreas was my baby. You know, I got I got a lot of pushback when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, all right? I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty. Proceed to the liver. Arriving at liver. Ow! Mind the gap. It's really scary in here, Rick. The liver's under maintenance. Reuben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great. Rick! It's a monster! No, no, no. Morty. The only monster here is alco holism. That is an animatronic werewolf. Who are you?! Answer me! Where'd you come from? My my my grandpa Rick sent me! Poncho! That's quite enough. Morty, that's Poncho. This is Roger and Annie. And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom. Hey, Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's going on here? I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down, and I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked. Exhibits? Anatomy park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the pancreas. Watch it. It is, first and foremost, a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases. Diseases? Hey, doc. I got news for you. Your living museum is officially a wild safari! Hepatitis A! Run! Oh, the food goes in your mouth, girl. Oh, Jacob. I'm sorry, Jacob. I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you, like, uh are you, like, their caretaker? Is that what it is?  We can go into detail later, son.  Now, wait. Ththere's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared body, and soul, and when minds and souls are joined for eternity and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body and an opportunity to share and experiment. Dad, please. What are you saying? Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard, and we support you. Hey, speak for yourself, because it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover. No, no, no, no, no, no. Jacob is your mother's lover. I watch them sometimes from a chair and sometimes from a closet, almost always dressed as superman. Oh. Jerry, this ham has got to be all you, right? It's incredible. Happy human holiday, dad. Aah! Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system. That's strange. Airflow is down 20%. So, the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security's offline. Well, I guess we better check it out. Hey! Wait for me! Put that back on! If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for a blockage. I'll go.  Don't be a hero, kid.  I'm not. I'm doing it because it's fun. We shouldn't be here. Whatever you do, do not fire that thing in here. We must save Reuben. This is my life's work. It's all right, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of these bacteria, but the scar tissue keeps them Dormant.  Morty, get down!  Whoahoho! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, what are those things? Tuberculosis coming in fast! Not faster than a bullet! Aah! No! Do you know what you've done?! Whoa! Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing! Whoaaaa! Don't let me die! Just take a deep breath, Reuben. You're not gonna die! What's your name? My name is Alexand Rick rrReuben's got tuberculosis! Oh, great work, Morty. Okay, I'll just cure it and then Okay. Well, I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor and pop by pirates of the pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's great, Morty. It's a bunch of Pirates running around a Pancreas. We don't whitewash it, either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get, you know, you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible, please, you gotta treat yourself. Oh, man. What is that horrible smell? You mean the panda express? Kidding. II'm kidding. The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We're inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy park is doomed. Forget about the park, doctor! How do we get out? The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all. Everybody, head for the colon! Now I'm taking orders from a Morty, the scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eye on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand. Intestines are ahead to the left, then to the right, then left, et cetera. Hey, just so you know, I'm actually 14. So, you know What?  Not 12.  Okay. You know, because he just said I was 12. Oh. Good for you. Oof. Ugh. Morty. Strike one.  It's a road of wonder   a trail of food   it's a pathway to break up   the bad and good   it's a tube that digests   and then sends out the rest   it's a small, small   intestine  It goes on like this for miles. Then we get to the large intestine! Shh! I hear something. Don't move. Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move. Wait, I was wrong. I was thinking of a T. Rex. Move! We're sitting ducks! Doc, didn't you say that the body was filling with gas?  Yes. Why?  Kid, you're a genius. Are you mad?! Everybody, in here! Hey, gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation? Huh.  Drummer drum drum   drum drum drum   drum drum drum drum drum drum   Christmas drums  Oh, sing it, Summer.  Christmas drums   being played by a Boooy  Oh, I love to hear you sing. Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted. I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad. What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here.  Summer!  Ethan? What are you doing here? I've been texting you for hours! What the hell?! I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday! Well, did you even consider how that might make me feel?! How you feel?! Why is everything always happening to you?! Summer, do you have a boyfriend? Yeah, do you, Summer? I don't know, Ethan. Do I?! Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man. I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray online. If it works, we'll be regularsized in a few minutes. I just hope Reuben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.  What the hell is that?  The sphincter dam. We built it when Reuben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse load. I've almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle. Poncho? What is this in your backpack? That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho? Everybody, get back! Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me? That's right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I'll take the highest bidder Alqaeda, North Korea, Republicans, shriners, balding men that work out, people on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers. Anything is better than working for you, you pompous, negligent, iTunesgiftcardasaholiday bonusgiving mother Come on! Aah! Get off! You guys! It's gonna burst! Go! Go, go, go!  My foot is stuck.  No! It's okay! It's okay. Just go. Tell my family I love them. They may be hard to find 'cause my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it, too, so, II don't know, you can No! Let me ask you a question, Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man? From Summer being a total bitch! Where's the anger coming from? My brother took me fishing once in the bushes I can't I can't He made me feel like a girl! He made me a girl! He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are. She is who she is. Now, you go to her brandnew. Come here, right now. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Ethan! I love you! I love you so much. Um You did it again, cubbie. Come here. No! Stop! I hate this! Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son. Well, then I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame. My name's Reuben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey Whoopsie. I'll be inside all of you. My story begins during the dotcom crash in the early '90s. You can put your fingers wherever you want. Morty, you want to put it on mute or something? I'm I'm trying to concentrate. Uh Rick? Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry. I wanted to say I'm sorry I ever judged you. Right now, you're my sanest relative. Relative. Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite. Morty, can you get to the left nipple? Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick. No, Morty, I'm talking about Reuben's left nipple. We need to get to the left nipple! The body is decaying. The arterial transit system is useless. We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the bone train. Would you like to ride the bone train, miss? If it'll get us out of here. How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the bone train? Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die! Let's go! Well I can see you're busy. Merry Christmas, Rick. There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually. Uh, well No, you're you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on. What the hell is that? E. Coli outbreak. Hurry!  Wait, there is an autopilot.  Wait! It's okay! Never mind! I wanted to sacrifice myself anyway! They're they're chewing through the doors! We're in the areola, Rick, almost to the nipple, but we're also in a really bad situation! I'm almost there, Morty! Reports from all over the country have been coming in about what appears to be a giant, naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom? Well, the eyes aren't twinkling and the dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a 70mile cherry. Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMahan in Los Angeles. We've got feet here on the west coast, Bill, giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size, and you know what they say about that. Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what's going down in the rocky mountains. Wha? Oh my God, the track! It's Hepatitis A! Aaaah! The nipple hole. It's beautiful.  Oh, no!  Holy crap! Whoa! It's Hepatitis C! Um wait did we have some sort of relationship with him? I think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys. Oh. Huh. Where's Dr. Bloom? I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead. God damn it, Morty. I ask you to do one thing! Jerry doesn't know what he's missing. He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together. I don't know, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will It's raining blood! Oh, shit. Find Jerry. Oh, God.  Jerry!  It's all right. The TV says there's nothing to worry about. The giant, naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine. Oh, yes. Dad, can I have my phone back? A sure, sweetie. Here. Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax.  This is nice.  Yeah. Look, I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob. No, we didn't, dad. No, we didn't. Too bad about Dr. Bloom. He was a genius the only man capable of creating a new anatomy park. Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create an entirely new, much safer park. What about Pirates of the pancreas? I think it was one of the most underrated attractions. Booyah! Hold your breath. Hey, what the hell, Rick?! What the hell, man! I liked her! I really had something going there, Rick! Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me.  Puffy vagina.  What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me. I don't know. Come on, let's get some stuffing. I'm starving. Oh, unbelievable. We got we got a bunch of robot, computer people, sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens. Do you guys realize that Christ was born today? Jesus Christ, our savior, was born today. Are are are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this? Hey, Rick? Rick, can you hear me? Loud and clear, Annie. Great. We're also on with Alejandro, our chief imaginarian. Hey, Rick. Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter from microscopic marketing, Zack from organ concepts, and Jamie from new media. Hey, everybody.  Hi, how's it going?  Hi, Rick. So, pirates of the pancreas. Yeah. Talk to me. Hey, Rick. It's Alejandro speaking. Um, so, we asked ourselves, internally we asked ourselves over here, "okay, what does a pancreas do?" And the answer was, "does it make pirates?" No, it makes Insulin, you know?  So, we're starting with a new  Those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park? Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Those people. This whole thing, Ethan. Cool. And who pays me? Corrections by XhmikosR
Corrections by XhmikosR This is just sloppy craftsmanship. Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh? Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it? Yeah, you know? There's something about the air and just the way the sunshine is. Uh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. Brilliant.  Very convincing.  Convincing? Oh. Responsive, too. In real time. I love it. Uhh okay. I'm going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye.  What's with mom?  Oh, what's with mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How sophisticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one. Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too. Whatever, quoteunquote "Morty." All right, well I'll see you after school. Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay. All right, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? Morty? Uh, me? What is 5 x 9? Umm you know, it's uhh at least 40. Morty, that's exactly correct! Come up here. Whoo! Way to go, Morty! Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. Teach us, Morty! Interesting. What do you want me to teach you? Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter? Oh, that's a good question. Concentrated huh? Concentrated dark matter the fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it? Umm Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist? Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff. I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I'll be your girlfriend. Uh, yyou will? Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty. Morty, uuh, come on.  There's a family emergency.  Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an "F".  He doesn't care.  Aw, man! Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! Ugh! Take a shower with me, Morty.  What?!  Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. You got to trust me, Morty. Ugh! I'm gonna get an "F" in class, Rick. Morty, that's not class. That wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship. Wait a minute. Wwhat are you talking about? It's all fake, Morty all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of crazy fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here. Monitor us?! Wwho?! Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity. Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone's just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica. I can't let you do that, Morty. Give it to me! No! You give it to me! Gggive it! No, Rick! Oh, God, sir! They're still naked! Ugh. Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not. I think we should make Kevin look, sir. What?! No! Why would you even say that? Uh, sir, we have a situation over here. If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to God, stu Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. There's another real human in the simulator. Okay, Jerry big pitch meeting. Makeorbreak time. You can do this. How did this happen?! Where's the abductions department? Hey, man, abductions just follows the acquisition order. Don't put this on acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated! Well, simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. There's still another human in here! Who is he? Rick's soninlaw, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation. Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target. Got to relax. It's just a pitch. Got to relax. This is earth radio. And now, here's human music. Hmm. Human music. I like it. Rick! Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your dingdong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs. I don't know, Rick. I mean, I've seen people do that before. Well, look at that old lady. She's she's walking a cat on a leash. Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick. Look, III don't want to hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! All right, all right, there. What about that, Morty? Okay, okay, you got me on that one. Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before? No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No. So, why are they doing this? Wwhat do they want? Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention. We got the President of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die! Concentrated dark matter? They were asking about that in class. Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this.  Now they're gonna pay!  What do you What are we gonna do? We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got. National apple farmers of America, welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith. All right. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, what are apples? Excuse me. What are apples? Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry. With that, I give you your new slogan! Well, say something!  Do you like it?  Yes.  You do?  Yes. So I sold it? I sold the idea?  Yes.  Oh, my God! Thank you!  Thank you.  You're welcome. Hey! I just sold my first pitch! Slow down! Lookin' good. My man! Hello. Guess who just sold the apples campaign. Who just sold the apples campaign? Me! I guess it wasn't a ripoff of "got milk?" after all.  Guess someone was wrong.  Yes. Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I've got an erection the size of an east coast lighthouse, and I'm coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.  Okay.  Wait really?  Yes.  Yes! See you in 10 minutes! Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife! Lookin' good.  Slow down!  My man! Aw, geez, Rick. I don't know if I like this plan, you know? I mean, crowds, they have a tendency to make me really nervous. Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine. Just follow my lead. Yo, deejay, drop that beat. Uhoh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, "the recipe for concentrated dark matter", for a crowd this tiny. You got that right, Rick. Now that's more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say "heyoh!" Yeah! All the ladies say, "yeah!" Everybody over 30, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! Yeah, don't move. Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an "L" who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times 10! Run, Morty! Before the system reboots! Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?! Oh, my God. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud. Oh, man, Rick! Where we running to? Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to The edge. Here we go. Holy crap! Come on, Morty. Sir, they're over the edge. Yes, they are. Just as planned. Oh, this is going to be such a mind Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots. So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them? It's an obsession for them at this point. The zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. Aha! Here we go. Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips. I've got so many, I can barely hold them all. Look at look at this. Oops. I dropped one. Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball. Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha! Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it! Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella. Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy. Totes malotes, dawg. Just kind of hard to believe, you know? Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the zigerions got nothing of mine. Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk? Yes. Look, I'm a fraud. I mean, let's face it, "hungry for apples" is just a ripoff of "got milk?" It's almost identical.  Yes.  Okay. I deserve that. Umm I guess I'll just pack up my desk. Yes. Oh, my God. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! There's not even a single word in "hungry for apples" that's shared by "got milk?". It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired.  I should be promoted!  Yes. Yeah! Wait. Really?  Yes.  Yes! I mean, I'm it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out  of this agency in a long time.  Yes. I'm not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an appley or something. Yes. Is there really an award called the appley for applerelated ad campaigns? Yes.  Could we nominate me?  Yes. Holy crap! Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. Huh. I thought I entered the code right. Wha well, what's this? What could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation Inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Gameday bucket go boom. Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific. We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours! Uh, yeah, until I get home before you, and change the combination, you bunch of idiots! That is why you're never getting home. Get them! Run, Morty! Oh, my God! Ow! I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And um Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's more meaningful than that. My man! Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete! My my my my man! What the hell?! No.  Jerry?!  Dad! What are you doing here? Why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time.  Come on.  No! Ohhhhh! Aah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oof! Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers. Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick! I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter. Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, plutonic quarks, and bottled water. It's all here, Rick! Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts plutonic quarks, one part cesium. Okay. Uhhuh. All right. Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time! Oh, no. What the No! Oh, my God, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation Of a simulation Inside another giant simulation! We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka! You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! You bunch of diabolical sons of bitches! Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project. You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I? All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now? I don't know. Can you? Ha! Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? You're not. Or are you? Oh, and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation. Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then? Yeah! Of course you should! No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can. Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity? You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us. Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right. All right, everybody. Two parts plutonic quarks One part cesium And listen, I'm sorry for yelling earlier. I couldn't ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. And the final ingredient Whoa! What the hell?! What happened back there? Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up. So What do you think? You're fired. Wha But this idea was tested in a stateoftheart simulation. Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out. Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife? Hey, Morty. What? Hey, little buddy. How you doing in here right now? Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man? You're a good kid, Morty. You're a real little character, Morty. Oh, boy. You know, I had a really rocky road today, Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, Morty? You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a real trouper, huh, Morty? Have you been drinking, Rick? I really appreciate you, Morty. Okay, cool. All right, Rick you little son of a bitch! Are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?! No! No! No! You little son of a bitch! I'm sorry, Morty. You're a good you're a good kid, Morty. Geez! You're a good you're a good kid. Oh, my God! What the hell? What a life.

Run! Morty, do it! Hit the button now! I can't do it, Rick! They're my parents and sister! Morty, I already told you it's not your family! They're clones from an alternate reality, possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button, already! Morty, please, I love you, sweetheart. Oh! Good work, Morty. You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable. You okay, Morty? I told you not to trust that tuna. I just killed my family! I don't care what they were. I don't know, Morty. Some people'd pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. You know what, Rick? That's it! I'm done with these insane adventures! That was really traumatizing!  I quit! I'm out!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, Morty, don't be like that. The universe is a crazy, chaotic place. You're the one that's crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun. Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah. Yeah, that that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position. But but, uh, how about next time you be in charge, and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is? Seriously, Rick? You'll you'll let me call the shots? Okay, yeah, fine. But let's make it interesting, Morty. If your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month. Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good I get to be in charge of every third adventure!  Every 10th.  Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going. Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.  Washing dishes?  No. The opposite. Can you fix it? Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework?  Yeah just don't do it.  Grandpa! Hey, Rick, you got some kind of handshaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar? Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family. Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk. Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar. Yes, siree! The Meeseeks fulfills the request.  All done!  Wow! And then it stops existing.  Oh, my God, he exploded!  Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods. All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!  So many possibilities.  My mind is racing. If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple.  I'm Mr. Meeseeks!  I want to be popular at school!  Ooh, okay!  Summer, what did I just Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! I want I want to be a more complete woman!  Beth!  Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am! You guys are doing it wrong. He said "simple." Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game. Ooh, yeah! Can do! Nailed it. God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky? Rick, this is a fantasytype world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things.  We're going on a quest, okay?  Can't wait. Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure! Oh, my God, so embarrassing. At last! Two heroes! You must help us! This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures! You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick.  There's a giant in the clouds!  Yeah. Beginner's luck. In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you! Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering No, I'll get your info from Summer. I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wideeyed girl from muskegon. She's still there, Beth. Well, her waistline isn't. Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free. You're saying I should leave Jerry. I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation. More wine? I think I've had enough. Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry. Yeah, yeah. I got it. That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down. Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down? Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax. You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up. I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me. Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck. No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks! Let me try something. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Hi, Mr. Meeseeks!  I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.  Hi! Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing? Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared? Ooh, he's trying! All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next? Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously. Uhoh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss? Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar. Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word. No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it. I smell the blood of whoop!  Holy crap.  Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out. Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying! Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, "hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?" Thth but that's not how it went down! Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that. Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun. Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you. The most important love you can receive is from yourself. Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club! Well, which is it, choke up or followthrough?! Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you. Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!  Just try to relax.  You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through. Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry. You're kidding me. Notice anything different? I'm sorry. Hours? Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her! Uhh Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird. Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty. Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.  We're gonna be okay, Rick.  How? They took my portal gun. This is an openandshut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tinypersons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore freefi to fohome. Wwhat the hell is he talking about? They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever. Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it! All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home? Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers. Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously a wash. Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps. Oh, boy, Morty. Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure. What do you say, Morty? I say give me a hand, sidekick. Everybody shut up! Let me try! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I'm going out. Wait. What? Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison? Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is I'll take you to dinner. Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine. I can't take it anymore. I just want to die! We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this? 'Cause he roped me into this! Well, him over there, he roped me into this! Well, he roped me into this! Well, what about me? He roped me into this. Well, that one over there roped me into this. Well, he roped me into this. Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps. All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid. Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step. Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircaseshaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun. What are you looking at, mother Easy, Rick. Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies. Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words? Rick We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippelyslippery stair. I'll take you down there for I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little? That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies. Hi, I'm Mr. booby buyer. I'll buy those boobies for It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline. Rats! What a shame. Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out. You keep heckling my adventure, Rick!  You know why?  Uh, because it's lame? It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here! Whatever. It's become clearlook at me that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's followthrough, we will solve this problem.  I'm Mr. Meeseeks.  I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution. Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst. Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say followthrough! Who's with me?! Followthrough! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Kill him! How are you today?  I'm Mr. jelly bean.  Hi, Mr. jelly bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure.  Nice. Is it a fun adventure?  I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails. Isn't that what adventures do? Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow. Yeah. Okay. Uh. Bbye. Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow. Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable. Stop fighting me. Just let this happen. Get off of me!  Sweet home Alabama  Whoo! No! Stop! Please! Stop being such a tease, you sweet little No! No! Everybody stooop! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done. The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game! No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game. Where's he going with this? What's he mean? When we kill him. Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about. Where would you go? I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina. Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut? What the heck? There he is! Run, Jerry! Come on out, Jerry! Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay? Oh, we're well past that, Jerry. Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got? Read 'em and weep, fellas! Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty.  It's not so bad.  Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over. We can't leave now, Morty.  I'm on fire!  Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. Please, I just want to go home. Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?  Really?  Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending. Buckle up! Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask Aah! what's your name, ma'am? Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants! Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre? Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you. I'm counting to three, Jerry. What the is going on? He's got it! That's a lower handicap strooke! Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game? Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?! Ooh, nice! I think we'll take our food to go. No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer. Fair enough. Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes! Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet. Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place. Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style. Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally. Uh, no, Iit's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry. So You still thinking about taking that trip? Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to "complete their task." Was I one of those guys? The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards. Well I got you pregnant. Yeah What the hell happened to this place? Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible. Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot. Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up? Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box. No. No more boxes. What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs! Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody. I don't get it. Sir, I think you're going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king jelly bean's closet. We have to tell the people. Wait. Destroy it. Our people will get more from the idea he represented than from the jelly bean he actually was.
Principal vagina here. Don't let the name fool you. I'm very much in charge reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. Hey. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to passover. Okay. Here we go. Hey, Jessica. Uh What's up, Morty? What are you doing? Um Wait, wait. Were you about to talk to her? Well I mean, I was thinking about it. Dude, stay in your league. Look at how hot she is. You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl. Gee, thanks, Brad. I throw balls far. You want good words? Date a languager. Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape. You're missing the point, dad. I don't want girls. I want Jessica. Ah, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named "your mom," and that's not an urban diss. Your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her. I thought, "I should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me." I beg your pardon, Rick. Inappropriate. Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty. His marriage is hanging from a thread. My marriage is fine, thank you. Jerry, it's your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care, and even inoticed. Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that. Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. Yeah, I'm just going to check on your mom. Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great. Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? Well, I was thinking, you know, could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing? You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something? Morty, that's such a poor use of my time. It's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. You know what? No, Rick! I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver. I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick! I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. What about me, Rick? Why can't you just help me out once once for once? You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass. Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. Do you know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love. All right, Morty, I just got to combine it with some of your DNA. Oh, well, okay. A hair, Morty. I need one of your hairs.  This isn't "game of thrones."  Ow! All right, Morty. Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever.  Are you happy now, Morty?  Heck, yeah! Thank you, grandpa Rick. Hey, there's no dangers or anything, or side effects, right? What am I, a hack? Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof. Eh, unless she has the flu.  Beth, do you still love me?  Ugh, what kind of question is that? The "yes or no" kind? Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?  Yes.  Are you gonna build them?  No.  Then what good was the "yes"? Wait, is loving me the house or the homeless people? Loving you is work, Jerry hard work, like building a homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in. So, what do you say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me? Sort of. Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I? So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more. Crap, they need me at the horse hospital. This late? The racetrack had a starlight derby. There was a sevenhorse collision, and Davin's there alone. Davin. Davin! Davin. Davin! Davin! Davin! Davin!  Flu, yo   you got to be aware   aware of all the flu   up in the air   I'ma get me a shot   and make the flu go away   fluhating rapper   just rapping away   yo, yo, fluhating rapper   it's a fluhating rapper  Hey, there, Jessica. Whoa! Oh, whoopsie! Oh, my God. Morty. You look really nice tonight. Wow, thanks. I love you, Morty! I love you so much it burns! Oh, man! I love you too, Jessica! Is this punk bothering you, Jessica? Leave him alone, jerk! I'm in love with him! He is more man than you will ever be!  This is about   flu awareness   got to be aware of the flu in   the airness   yo, I'm a fluhating rapper  Oh, man, Morty. I'm really sorry. Oh, well, no problem, Brad. There's something special about you, Morty so special.  Mmm, yeah.  Whoa, take it easy! Get your hands off of him!  Back off!  I'm trying to be with my man! That's enough, Bradley! We don't want you injuring your ballthrowing arm. Oh, come on, principal Vagina. Never leave me, Morty. Never! Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about? Who cares? Just hold me. Let me go! I love you, Morty! Let go of me! Morty! She's gonna be alone with that guy all night. Yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses. It's not a very romantic setting. Well, Summer, there's always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up. Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides. Grandpa, so gross! You're talking about my mom. Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card. She's not responding to my texts! Careful, dad. Jealousy turns women off. Well, isn't that convenient? Not for the men they cheat on, no. Okay, I'm going to go out for some ice cream. And maybe stop by the hospital to support my wife with my confidence.  God, grandpa, you're such a dick.  I'm sorry, Summer. Your opinion means very little to me. How come you're not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much? Screw that. I don't want to get sick.  It's flu season.  It is?  Yeah.  Uhoh. Please just let this work out. Do it, Morty. Do it. Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life! Um Can we maybe go somewhere more private? Jessica, get a hold of yourself! You don't deserve to carry Morty's genes.  I love Morty   and I hope Morty loves me   I'd like to wrap my arms   around him   and feel him inside me  Oh, crap. Morty! Morty, come on! We got to get you out of here. You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. Morty!  Are you okay?  I'm fine! Oh, good. If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself. I love you bad, momo! Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, and we're both insecure enough to agree to a threeway! I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu, you know, that might have been valuable information for me, Morty. What the hell is going on, Rick? What does it look like? The serum is piggybacking on the virus. It's gone airborne, Morty. Oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick? It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax. I whipped up and antidote. It's based on prayingmantis You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty. I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner. I mean, it's a whole ritual. It's really gruesome and totally opposite. There's no love at all. I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus. It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty. It'll all be over very shortly. Morty! Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything, but I'm not interested in having sex with you. These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically. Morty! Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty. A lot of people don't get that. Come on. Are you kidding me? Hello! Morty! You're not Morty! Bring us Morty! Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. I had sex with Billy. But you were already pregnant! Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen? We interrupt "pregnant baby" with breaking news. Come on. This just in; Morty Smith's whereabouts are still unknown. What the hell? The only thing that is known is how cute he is. I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head. I love him more than you do, Harold! You wish, you stupid bitch! Morty's mine! Morty's mine! Meant to be together! Morty! Where is Morty? Oh, my God, Rick. The whole world is infected! Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread. I've really outdone myself. Outdone yourself?! Are you kidding me, Rick? This is not okay! Not only do they all want to have sex with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards! Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, DNA's a little more complicated than that. You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the trick, baby. It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur. Should add up to normal humanity. That doesn't make any sense, Rick. How does that add up to normal humanity? What, Morty, you want me to show you my math? I'm sorry are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid? Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses, but I'm almost sorry we're finished. Yes, it's satisfying work. Unhunhunh, it's, uh it's more than the work. I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world. It's the only time I can really think and feel. Hmm, uh, what are you doing? I'm playing African dream pop. What do you do after a long night? Oh, ha, um, hey, I'd better get going. Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty highmaintenance stuff. Beth What is it, Davin? Just once, I'd like to know what it was like to give your son a bath. What?! What does Morty's skin smell like? How soft How soft are his privates? Let go of me, Davin! Take me to Morty. You're not Morty. No. I'm Mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar. That's stupid. Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you. Jerry! Thank God! God? God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you. Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal. Just do it already. Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush. I mean, you know, once it's fixed, it's done. It's fixed. You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit. I mean, look at how crazy it is. I mean, Morty, when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I mean, soak it in, you know? It's it's pretty neat.  It's pretty interesting.  That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever. What do we have here, Morty? Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh? I bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? I bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty. Oh, Rick, something's not right. Yeah, you.  You're not right ever.  No, no! Look, you idiot! Bet you're loving this, Morty. This must be the best day of your life. You get to be the mayor of "I told you" town. You're welcome. Hold on. I wish that shotgun was my penis. If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway. I don't get it, and I don't need to. Mom! Dad!  Summer!  Summer!  Where's Morty?  I don't know. Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this? It's not fair to assume that, Summer. Oh, not fair? Give me a break. He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother. A real man stands by his woman. Tchootchootchoo. Tchootchoo. Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't I? We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty. At least they're not in love with you anymore, though. That's a huge step in the right direction. Oh, my God! It's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible, Rick? Me irresponsible?! All I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted me to buckle down and make you up a roofiejuice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school. I mean, are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the high road on this one? You're a little creep, Morty. You're you're just a little creepy creep person. All right, fine. I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum. I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick. But I'll tell you something you know what? You got to accept your part of the blame! I'm not the one who fouled up the serum! I'm not the one who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs! You got to fix this, Rick! All right, all right, Morty. You know, we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking. Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting. Wow, Rick, I got to say, you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time. I mean, I really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do. Whoo! That's some great luck. Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it. I'm great. That's the real reason. Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer? Sure thing, Rick. Here's a screwdriver. All right, Morty. Thank you very much. We got one screw turn and two screw turns and All right, Morty, here we are. Oh, my God, Rick! Is that us?! We're dead! What is going on, Rick? I'm freaking out! Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty! No, I can't deal with this!  Calm yourself, Morty.  I can't deal with this, Rick!  Calm down, Morty.  This can't be real! You got to calm down, Morty. We're ripped apart! Shut up and listen to me! It's fine. Everything is fine. There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal. I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time. Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine. We're not skipping a beat, Morty.  Now, help me with these bodies.  This is insane. Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean, that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up. Rick, what about the reality we left behind? What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it. It's not like we can do this every week, anyways. We get three or four more of these, tops. Now, pick up your dead self and come on. Haste makes waste. I don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.  Look on down from the bridge   there's still fountains down there   look on down from the bridge   it's still raining up here   everybody seems so   far away from me   everybody just   wants to be free   look away from the sky   it's no different when you're   leaving home   I can't be the same   thing to you now   I'm just gone   just gone   how could I say goodbye?   How could I say goodbye?  You know, the thing about a shark He's got lifeless eyes black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the the blood, and the red, and the water You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty? Sometimes. But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy. Here we are, cronenberg Morty, a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged. We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty. It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world. Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know? I mean, I wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around. Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty. Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?
Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator. That is multiphase quantum resonator.  Well, does it defraculate?  No. Then it's a broken defraculator. Like you would even know dick about fraculation. Your planet just got cellphones and the coverage still sucks! Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur. So lets say 60 smidgens. I tell you what I'll do you a favor. I throw in a fart. Hey, Rick You think maybe I could get something from this place? Like a souvenir? Like just to have, like something cool, you know? Not here Morty. We'll stop somewhere else, because you know, there is always another pawn shop. OK, I just You know, I thought that robot over there, looked pretty cool, you know? Oh, it looks cool, huh?  That's why you want it?  Yeah, you know? I mean it's different from the stuff on earth. And you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and you know, I don't really have anything to to remember all those trips by. It'd be kind of cool like a souvenir, you know? Like what if you passed away or died or something? I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know. Okay, 60 for the resonator and my grandson wants the sex robot. Corrections by XhmikosR So we're just going to pretend this isn't happening? I'm not saying that's a bad idea. Just asking. Rick, why did you let Morty bring that thing into our house? What do you want from me? He thought it looked cool, you know what I mean? Alright, back to back to back upstairs. Well, I'm intervening. Intervening with puberty? You'll turn him into Ralph Finnes in Red Dragon. He is at that age, let's just be proud of him. Jesus, did I really set the bar that low? Rick, could you come with me please? Quickly! OK, now if we here squeaking we intervene. Where is the sex robot Morty? That is Gwendoline. I mean the robot. She started beeping, and then transformed and tried to fly away. Strange. That's usually the man's job. You know what I'm talking about, Morty? Morty. That's my catchphrase, remember? Remember how I cemented that catchphrase? Alright, alright seriously though. Let me grab this thing. Come on.  Rascal.  Okay unacceptable What is going on? Alright What is that? I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends. Genetic compiler, incubation chamber. Yeah, this here is some kind of baby maker. And that there is half Morty and half who knows what. It's my bad guys I'll take care of it. Hey listen, you guys quarantine the house when Summer brought olives from Mexico. This thing could grow to the size of Delaware. It might eat brains and exhale space AIDS. We gotta be careful. I lost the chance to be careful, Rick. I'm a father now, you know? It's time for me to be responsible. Isn't that right  Don't name it!  Morty Jr.? Oh crap, he named it. Well Dad, it's a living thing. And it's half human. And it was born on America's soil which entitles it Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake. Don't punish us for it. Fine. I'm gonna take this thing into my workshop, and do a little bit of investigating. Do not let that thing out of your sight. It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous.  Like the Insane Clown Posse.  Yeah, good one, Jerry. wants its easy target back. He is a like little me. You don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you? They always do. their "certain year called wanting its blank back" formula back. Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort? Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die. Out.  What you doing?  Well, I can't solve the problem my way thanks to your family's primitive biological hang ups. Gross. I might have just touched one of Morty's loads. But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr. on this robot homeworld, which is Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system.  Scoot Summer.  Don't you need a new companion now that Morty is in the family way? I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer. Oh right, because there is something about having a wiener that would make me better walking through a hole? Oh crap. Grandpa Rick! Help! Help! Grandpa Rick! Still think it's a good idea to go through a hole without a wiener?  I wanna go home!  Yeah, no duh. Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs. You're doing great, Morty. Really you think? I mean I'm not doing much of anything. What do I do if it cries? Then you put it down and let it cry itself out. Yeah, right. We tried that technique on Summer and she is gonna end up stripping. Isn't she? Yes she is. She is gonna strip her attention because she was denied it. Stop filling it with your own insecurity. You're gonna turn it into Mort more more more of you. Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentallyill scientist. What the Listen to me. I am not rewarding this behavior. Knock it off both of you! Give me him! Give me my baby! You're both nuts. I'm gonna raise Morty Jr. myself. Where is your hands? There's your hands. And that's how we play happy hands. Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty. At least we can agree on that. Thanks, dumb dumb. I said "thanks, dumb dumb". Go get more. Summer, put your burqa on! That burqa is a human rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top. Look, I'm trying to repair portal gun with with bunch of sex doll parts and I have to do it onehanded to keep these belushis from cutting you off. The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender. What's the deal with this place? Why is it such a sausage planet and how did such backwards idiots invent robots? Obviously at some point the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines. The resultant lack of distraction and handpecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long. You think it's efficient to get rid of women? You ever see a line for the men's room? Are you hea Do you lis You hear me, summer? The plot thickens. You might wanna cover your eyes, Summer. Yeah, like it was my dream to watch. Summer, grab hold. Grandpa Rick, where are we going? Well obviously Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class. Sound familiar? Ticketmaster. There we go, Summer. Hey brother. Hey bro. Nice racket you got going on here. Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from earth dimension C137. Don't mean any harm. Coming in peace. It's all cool in the good in the neighborhood. That was what I was trying That's what I meant. Oh, I get it. The old "behind every great man amazon" twist. Silence! Your slave is illmannered.  My slave?  We assume you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants. If he is a rogue male, tell us now, and we will kill him. He's my slave. He's my slave. He is definitely my slave. Oh boy, what's the opposite of Am I right ladies and gentlemen? You guys kidding me. Morty Jr., you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you? You're my special little guy. DA What was that, Morty Jr.? Were you gonna say Dada? Say Dada. Death! Dada. Domination! Dada? Destruction, domination. Nice. The spider in sector C is still alive. Plan your route accordingly and expect delays. We're not telling you what to do. We're just sharing how we feel. And now, weather. Is anyone else cold or is it just me? I am Marsha, ruler of Gazorpazorp. I am here if you need to talk. What is this place? Paradise. We built it during the great passive aggression, when females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior.  I'm here if you need to talk.  I'm here if you need to talk. From here we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population. Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery. The females are placed into educational program where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most. The males they get to play outside. That was just a baby. And within a day he'll be an adult male Gazorpian, one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe. Wait a minute. We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet. You speak when you're spoken to dingaling. It's true though. One of your babies was born on earth. Are you the ruler of this earth? How did you know?  The quality of your top.  Do you love it? I love it. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk.  I'm here if you need to talk.  I'm here if you need to talk. If the Gazorpian is male your earth is in grave danger. We will give you passage back home, so it can be terminated. But first, mojitos! We don't have time for mojitos! You are insulting them. I don't care Summer. This place is the worst! I wanna go home! Well, it really doesn't matter what you want because this is a sane place, where women rule. You know what I have to say about that? I can not believe my ears. Boy, who let the frogs out, huh? Grandpa!  Grandpa?  That sounds patriarchal. It means father of fathers. Then this one is not your slave and your earth is yet another planet dominated by men. It's not dominated by us, okay? On earth men and women are equals. Equals? We make 70% of your salary for the same job! Seize them! Was this really the time to make that point, Summer? This is for you Daddy. Oh man. Okay. Listen to me Morty Jr. I gotta tell you something very important, okay? Killing is bad. Bad. You are silly, Daddy. No, Morty Jr. I'm being serious, okay? You need to put your energy into something else. I mean what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance? I like to dance on the graves of my enemies. No, Morty Jr.! Daddy, can I go outside? No, absolutely not! But that's where all the people and the animals are. Yeah, but you can't go out there because The air is poisonous, for you! You will die if You'll die instantly if you ever leave this house. Do you hear me?  For real?  For real times a million, buddy. So let's just stay inside let's try dancing. Right? Look at me. We're gonna dance. Come on. Join, dance with me here. We love to dance. Why do we love to dance? Because I said so!  Nice.  Nice. So, what are you in for? Because I got a big you know penis between my legs. What are you in for? The worst crime a female can commit. Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs. You ever noticed the ones with bad bangs always have three names? You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment! This is gonna be cake. No! Jackie! Rick and Summer of earth. For the crimes of treason against woman kind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to What? A night on the couch? Death. I hate you so much right now. This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness. So we are forced to improvise. We placed a large boulder on that ledge. Holly shit! You're gonna crush us with a boulder?! No! Stop interrupting! The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch  Knives.  What?! Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself. Stop interrupting! The knives will Fine! You were right the first time, okay? The boulder crushes you. I just didn't want to admit you were right.  Happy?!  Just ignore them.  Ignore them.  Such an asshole. Look, I'm sorry, Summer. I feel bad that I let you drag us into this. I wish could have been a better grandpa to you. And you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice cute top, that you're wearing there. Top? My top! My top! The same top you complimented earlier. Look! Look at the tag! Read it! It says Mark Jacobs. Mark? Jacob? These are names of the penis. Yes. An earth man made this top. Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on earth, a certain percentage of males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours. It's true. And sometimes the truth hurts. But it must be accepted. Like if I told you that you're using a wrong color foundation for your skin, and it ends at your neck making you look like a party clown. Okay. Ouch. Noted. But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on earth you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute. Very well. Give the earth people spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal, but not really. Good job, Summer, and thanks girls. You girls are really something, I tell you that. You know, when we first got here  I was like  Give them a ship, now. Morty Jr.! Smoking?! That is not okay! What are you gonna do, ground me? I can't go outside anyway! So what? You could do things inside. You could play guitar, you could masturbate I don't wanna masturbate, I wanna conquer the planet! Oh, here we go again! Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet Morty Jr.? Love. That's all you care about. What about weapons? What about domination of the enemy? Alright, that's it, no more History Chanel! This TV is for cartoons and video games only! I hate video games! You take that back! Give it to me! I didn't mean! I didn't mean that! I didn't mean to do that! I'm sorry! I can't take this anymore! I'd rather breath poison than living another minute with you! No! No, no, no! Stop! My life has been a lie! God is dead! The government's lame! Thanksgiving is about killing Indians! Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, they moved the date, it was a pagan holiday!  Oh, Dad!  Yes, Morty? My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive. Can you help me get him back? I suppose, Morty. I suppose. But first a deep sip from a very tall glass of "I told you so". Oh my god, please Dad, come on! Dad, there he is! Oh God. Hey stop that! Oh my god, oh my god, Dad! Morty Jr., no! It's me. It's Dad. It's okay. Put the car down Morty Jr. No! Where's your hands? Where's your hands? My car!  And that's how we play handy hands.   Out of the way, Morty!  No! Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creature in the universe. He's my son! And if you hurt him, you have to kill me, Rick! Dad, I'm so confused. I know Morty Jr. I'm sorry. I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me. You know parents are just kids having kids. One minute you like how a shiny robot looks, the next minute you're in a fist fight with your alien son. I'm an alien? We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts. We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive. But I want to murder everyone I see. Well you know, maybe there is a job out there for people that feel that way. Actually, there is. Hi, I'm Brad Anderson. Creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip "Marmaduke". You should consider being a creative. I'm hunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual assaults on a nearly daily basis. But you know? I channeled it all into my work. I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke. Well, did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh? Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson. See, you hear that, Morty Jr.? Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind. Maybe? I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel. I mean what I really wanna do is slit people's throat, but, beyond that. I know you can do it, son. I think it's time I get a place of my own. I promise I call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry. So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear Axel? Isn't it interesting Summer, that after all that stuff we just did nothing really mattered, there was no point to it. Kind of makes you wonder, huh?  About nothing  Are you sure it doesn't make you reevaluate your policy about taking girls on adventure? No I'd say given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time, and any epiphanies about gender politics were projection of your feminine insecurity. But hey, why don't you have pink spaceship? Go ride around, and have a jolly old time. Maybe that'll shut you up. Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time? On Gazorpazorp. Where were you? I was reading a newspaper. Oh, that's interesting, Beth. You know it's funny I heard about a little bit of news, myself. Take a look. Take a listen. This world still got a still got a chance! See you guys next week! See everybody next week! Mortimer Smith Jr. New York Times best selling author. Your book is about innocence, the definition of it, and inevitably its impossibility. Is it autobiographical? Certainly. I mean, all writing is, in my opinion. But, my My father kept me locked in the house until I was a teenager. And there was violence and threats of poison gas.  But also dancing.  But you persevered and created this masterpiece from your suffering. Smith Jr.'s mindbending novel, "My Horrible Father" in every store and on everyone's mind pick it up, we'll be right back. It's a thankless job, Morty. You did the best you could. I hope he's eating enough. Corrections by XhmikosR
Cynthia  Oh, my God! No, no  I told you!  Hold on Will you please Not marry me? I choose Veronica.  What?  Yes!  Called it.  Why would he choose Veronica? Because he loves her. Well if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid. Okay, I've got an idea, Rick. You show us your concept of "good TV", and we'll crap all over that. I thought you'd never ask. Hey! Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions. Twenty percent accurate, as usual, Morty. The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality. Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme? How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn. We're not so different. We're both corn of action. Yeah. But one of us is dead corn!  Boring.  Summer, you just spent three months, watching a man choose a fake wife. So what? It'd be better if the people were corn? Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. This shit is delicious. A movie about a guy eating shit. A violent Antiques Show  It's a pleasure to have you.  The pleasure's all mine. Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous  Wait!  What in the hell? I agree. Where is this going? No, the other thing! Go back! Really? All right, fine. Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore. All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked. Rick and Morty S01E08 "Rixty Minutes" by paulo loppes Corrections by TPBfan Tweaking by XhmikosR Coming up next on "Shmloo's the Shmloss", Shmlony has a nightmare. Shmlantha, Schmlona! Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with "Schmla". Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan All right, that got that actually got old pretty quick. Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman? Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel.  Go back, go back!  Jeez You speak da trutru. Oh my God! Dad's in Cloud Atlas! I'm in Cloud Atlas! What's Cloud Atlas? Sometimes small trutru different than da big trutru. How is this possible? Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities. Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Wa Look at this. And now, another Quick Mystery. I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty! I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints. Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison.  Here's another Quick Mystery.  My mother's dead! And I killed her. Here's the weapon. And cuff me, thank you very much. Guilty! Sentenced to murder.  Here's another.  I'm the killer! Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it? Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?  I want to obsess about myself.  The narcisstic stuff. Here. These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. Go fetch!  Yes! This is so cool!  Ladies First! I'm proud of you, Morty. Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo! I'm AntsInMyEyes Johnson, Here at AntsinMyEyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can't I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices I hope aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm AntsinMyEyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing! And also I can't feel anything either, did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know. Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives? You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee. Give me those!  What do you see?  Whiteness. Pure whiteness. You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you. Whoa I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp! Haven't we spent enough time on you? I'm performing surgery but not on a horse, on a human! That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon. I am a real surgeon.  Ahh uh Summer's turn!  Finally! I don't see anything. Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born. That came out wrong. That came out very wrong. Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me. We're playing Yahtzee.  Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.  It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second? It's a 45 horsepower with antilock brakes, and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. It's the brandnew Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise. It's polite, it's right, and it's Sneezy Deezy Mc Deluxe. Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo! Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it. Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone. It's in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came and that's when things got knocked into 12th gear. A Mexican armada shows up. With weapons made from Totomatoes. And you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business. In: Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a van from an Asteroid and All Sorts of Things THE MOVIE! Hold on, there's more! Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross attack these two brothers. But let's get back to the brothers, because they're they have a strong bond. You don't want to know about it here, but I'll tell you one thing: The moon it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It's two brothers and and ththey're It's called Two brothers Two brothers! It's just called Two Brothers. Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize. Come on! Time's up! I'm taming a lion! No, wait, uh there are film cameras. I might be a liontamer in a movie. You get the idea. I work with lions. Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee, we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know predictable? When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals. Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night. Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back. Now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables!  What are you talking about?  All this time, you've been thinking, "What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?" Well now you know, you'd be a doctor. Whoopdeedoo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht, banging Kristen Stewart! You thought about getting an abortion? Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it.  So you're welcome.  Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy. Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called "Ball Fondlers". I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse.  I'm in heaven right now.  This might be the best day of my life. So now what do we do? That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting.  Dad!  What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has interdimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.  We'll I'm leaving!  You can't leave, you're 17! Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age.

A man painted silver who makes robot noises! Gar Manarnar! Three uh uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to that one A hole in the wall, where the men can see it all and returning, for his 25th consecutive year: Bobby Moynihan! Interesting fun fact, uh, Moynihan and piece of toast hate each other. Apparently they've got some real creative differences.

Don't worry about it Let's just just see where this goes. Step on it, we all got places to be! Son of a bitch! See, that must be where he lives OK. Huh. Making himself a sandwich now Hey everybody! So this is my house, I just made a sandwich, peanut butter and jelly, still here, still selling fake doors!  What?  Oh, my God! It's still the commercial! We have fake doors like you wouldn't believe! What are you worried about? Come get fake doors. Call us up, and order some fake doors today. Don't even hesitate, Don't even worry and don't even  All right, I'm bored. Change it.  Wait wait, Rick! Hold on. Even give it a second thought. That's our slogan. See it on the bottom of the screen, below our name. Here's another slogan, right below that one. What are you worried about? Come get fake doors Get in here quick, get out quicker, with an arm of fake doors in you arms. Okay, okay, you can change it. Don't even worry about it I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I really could go for some enchiladas. Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield. Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where uh where those Sex robots came from, remember? That whole thing? Yeah hey, that's pretty, pretty that's true. That's right! Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield! Hey Jon, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield. Boy. [BLEEP] you, Jon. You [BLEEP] dumb, stupid, idiot. Come on, Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh? You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white uh, uh guilt, white guilt, milquetoast piece of human garbage.

Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray. No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive. Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters. Which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp or Garfield, I mean. Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too? I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? IIII know everything about everything? Did you really talk me out of the abortion? Well, we we blew a tire on the way to the clinic. I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise. What is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it. So we didn't do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves, or Or? Man. Woman. And now trunk men? We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners. But we don't like the idea of these people getting married. Put a line in the sand everybody, people! Vote no on proposition XW2. The act that says that gay uh trunk people can get married. Who needs it? Not on my watch! Paid for by Michael Dennys and The Denny Singers. Hi, I'm a trunk person. And I want II feel love in my heart, too, just like you. I want to be able to express that love, with both a man and a woman. And I won't be able to If Denny and The Denny Singers get their way. Hey, let the trunk people have sex and get married, huh? Paid for by Trunk People. Oh, I love me Strawberry Smiggles! Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me, and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles. I'm going to eat every last one of them, because and then they'll be in my stomach, and nobody will ever be able to eat them. Except for me, because they're going to be all inside my stomach. I'm my name is Mister Top Hat Jones, and God forbid anyone ever take my sniggy, little pigdul smiggles. I'm keeping 'em all for me. Last bite. Oh, now they are all resting comfortably in my stomach. Ooh, am I feeling good. No! Get away from me! Get away from me and my Strawberry Smiggles! No! Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! It hurts! My entrails are out! Why would you even want to eat these? They're soaked with my stomach acid! Oh, Jesus Christ! Lord and savior and spirit! Save me! Take me to the light! Oh, my God, I see Demons! I see demons are coming! Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial. Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. Pedal to the metal, Morty. In a world, where muscular mannies, are coming, and they're coming strong, there's only three unmuscular Michaels. Get down! Hurry, run! And that's when real turbulent juice is coming, and you gotta take care of it. With turbulent juice, Turmulent tables. No room is safe from the turbulent power of turbulent juice.  What in the hell?  Sex sells, Morty. Sex sells what? Was that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff? Hey, Dad. Wwwhat's going on? Oh, your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart, Morty.

Baby Legs, you're a good detective but not good enough, because of your baby legs. So I'm partnering you up with Regular Legs.  Hey there.  Detective, I'm this is upsetting to me, because I feel like I don't need no regularleg partner. Baby Legs, don't talk back to me. Good luck you two, there's a criminal to kill. Wow, you sure found this guy quick! Uh, yeah, because I'm a good detective. Look, Baby Legs, it's the criminal! [BLEEP], I'm the killer. I'm running, running real quick Baby Legs, here we go!

Hey, that was good team work. Baby Legs, and Regular Legs, I'm proud of you two for working together, and Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner.  But I'm proud of you that you did it.  Hey thanks, chief! Now get the [BLEEP] out of here! Pretty cool, huh, Morty? Oh. Uh, I thought it was cool. I don't give a [BLEEP] what you think, Jerry. Hey, uh YYYYou doin' okay? III kind of know how you feel, Summer. No, you don't. You're the little brother. You're not the cause of your parents' misery. You're just a symptom of it.  Can I show you something?  Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make make me feel like less of an accident. That, out there? That's my grave. Wait, what? On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, aaand we buried ourselves, and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast, own rotting corpse. So, you're not my brother? I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says, "Don't run". Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV.

Yay you win. Where the hell am I going? What are you asking me for Jerry? I'm sitting here trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out. They got a clear shot to your head. I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this. Jerry? Jerry Smith? Beth Sanchez, I have been in love with you since high school. I hate acting, I hate cocaine, I hate Kristen Stewart. I wish you hadn't gotten that abortion, and I never stopped thinking about what might've been. Hey, Ball Fondlers? Huh? Ball Fondlers?  Yeah, I could go for some Ball Fondlers.  Yeah, Ball Fondlers.

Hey, Rick. I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend.  You think you could help me out?  Whatever. Well, I mean, traditionally, science fairs are a fatherson thing. Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing. Morty, I think it would be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad. Uh Yeah, dad. Why don't we do it together? Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son. We'll get out the crayons, brew some coffee, and knock this thing out in two or three days.  What is my purpose?  Pass the butter. Thank you. Dad, I need a ride to work. Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I'm helping Morty with science. I'm busy. Doing what? Uh, anything else.  What is my purpose?  You pass butter. Oh, my god. Yeah, welcome to the club, pal. Corrections by XhmikosR  Since when do you have a job?  Since last week. It's parttime at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart, eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me. Meow. Can't wait to meet this fascinating character. Please don't. Oh. Well, when did this stop being Jamba Juice? I've just recently opened for business, mister, um, Goldenfold. You know my name? That's disarming. I also know you long for female company. You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can't be filled with Jamba Juice. This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge. One never pays here not with money. Nothing to read into there. Thanks! Sorry I'm late, mr. Needful. This is my grandpa, Rick. He was just leaving. Huh. Tell me, Rick, what do you desire? Eh, I make my own stuff. So, what are you like, the devil?  What? Sorry?  I don't know. Store comes out of nowhere, all the shit's old and creepy. Are you the devil? A demon?  Leprechaun?  Grandpa Rick! Hey, I'm not judging. Just like shoot straight. I'm a man of science. Ah, then perhaps you could make use of this. This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Grandpa, go home and drink. Why don't we do a model of the solar system? That's what my dad did with me when I was your age. Oh, okay. You know, Rick's in his lab, making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science. A man and his boy, making planets. Hey, how about we use a pingpong ball for Pluto? And then Jupiter  Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto's a planet. Of course Pluto's a planet, son. I learned that in the third grade. Well, yeah, but you know they changed it. Morty, nobody changed the planets. I just googled it. Pluto's not a planet. They changed it in 2006. Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.  And I disagree.  You disagree? That's right. It's possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet. Some committee of fancy assholes disagree. I disagree back. Give me a pingpong ball. Um, okay. II just have to Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto? No. Geez, I just got to go to the bathroom. Damn. Oh. Okay, good. This is gonna be fun. Hey, Morty, let me ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it? Um Rhetorical question, Morty. The answer's "yes, you just have to be a genius". Cute. Your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded. Ooh. Oh, boy, Rick. I'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know? Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled. I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded. Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick. I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing. Well, that's retarded. What are you guys talking about? Apparently, nothing. You asked him if Pluto's a planet, didn't you?  No!  It's not.  Shut up, Rick.  Whoa. I don't care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet. Stay scientific, Jerry. This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent! A price for everything, mr. Goldenfold. A price for everything. Oh, my God! How could I not see this coming?! My lust! My greed! I deserved this! I deserved this! This serum should counteract the negative effects. Holy cats! Ladies, let's get out of here. I haven't learned a thing! Here. You can have this back. You didn't use it? Sure I did  to develop this. It detects and catalogs all your "twilight zone", "ray bradbury", "Friday the 13th" the series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say A typewriter that generates bestselling murder mysteries and then makes the murders happen in real life?  Ooh.  Be quiet. Don't you want to make sure people know what they're getting? You're not intentionally selling beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind? I find this all quite preposterous. Oh, I say, good sir. Oh, harrumph. Oh, oh Oh, oh that's beautiful. You know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours? Do I need to call the police? Here, you can use my phone. Don't worry. It won't make you deaf because I'm not a hack. You think you're so great, you stupid piece of shit. Stop! Hey! [Beep] you, man. Stop it right now! Grandpa Rick, I like working here. You work for the devil. So what? "So what?" Yes, so what if he's the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he's active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food and make gadgets. Buhbye. Whoops. I'm sorry, mr. Needful. I'll clean that up. I don't know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but  It's fine. Summer, you know, your grandfather's right. This store curses people. That's my business. Well, yeah. Fastfood gives people diabetes, and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn't evil? This is my first job. You've been nice to me, mr. Needful. You respect me. Please, call me "the devil". I'd rather not, actually. Yes, perhaps not during business hours. I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet. Well, then my son's going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I'm suing you first. I think I know what the "a" in NASA stands for. Dad, what's your endgame? Ain't no game, sucka. Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets? It's even easier. Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn't always easy, Morty.  Whoa!  Whoa! What the hell?! I'm king Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto. We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA. I was  you know, sometimes science is about conviction. I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you. Oh, I Plutonians. Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth, where he's creating a model of our solar system. Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision. Um Pluto's a planet. Pluto's a [beep] planet, bitch! Oh, man. This is definitely gonna go to his head. If it's athletic prowess you desire, principle vagina, I might   I'll take it.  But I haven't even  Thank you very, very much. Great store. Great place. Bye. Huh. Okay. I must say, summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I've had since salem. Nice.  "Wholesome delight" for lunch?  Is that the vegan place?  Yeah, I love their soup.  I'm kind of souped out. Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire? Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey. Oh, is there a limit? Everything's free, right? Let's just say you don't pay with money. That was perfect. You pay with the curses, right? Um I  well But, mrs. Tate, why do you want cursed items? Well, I'm going to get the curses removed at "Curse Purge Plus". You know, the guy on TV? What? Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but [beep] with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to "Curse Purge Plus". I use science to uncurse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers. This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I don't know, $8 million. See you at the olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes. Everything's deductible. Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We're located at First and Main in old town. Come on  come on down. "First and" That's right across the street from "Needful Things," where you can get evil items for free! Diabolic son of a motherf We're back on "Good morning, Pluto." And a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist Jerry Smith, who's making headlines with his bold announcement that is what, Jerry? Pluto is a planet.  Well, how about that.  I love it. Morty Smith. I'm Scroopy Noopers. I'm a scientist.  Can I show you something?  Uh, I better not. Right now. The center of Pluto, mr. Smith, is made of a substance called "Plutonium". Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks. There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn't even call it a "planet" anymore. Should've been our wakeup call. But the rich Plutonians won't wake up, and they love your dad telling everyone Pluto's a planet because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally Um, a party? Is everyone in your family an idiot? Well, for sure me and my dad are. Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives. Yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure. Hmm. Funny. Mr. Needful, out of everything in the store, you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I wish this desk was lighter. I wish this knot was looser. Come on. I don't  Wait, what am I doing? I wish I knew CPR. Oh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw. Mr. Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible? I'm the devil. What should I do when I fail  get myself an ice cream? You haven't failed. People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean, seriously. I may be "the devil", but your grandpa is the devil. I just want to go back to hell, where everyone thinks I'm smart and funny. No! It's not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you  even Rick. I was your only friend, and I get nothing? Okay. I'll give you one thing.  Name it.  I want to help you. Clever twist. I learned from the best, you old fart. Now, let's go get you hydrated. Looks like we've got haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the "eternity" and the padding, and then you'll have some timetraveling mittens. Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby.  How's business?  Here's the last of our inventory. We're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring. Sounds like code for "you win, Rick." That was important to you, wasn't it? Nope. It was important to your dumb devil friend. To me, this was all just a bit, like when bugs bunny [beep] with the opera singer for 20 minutes. He tried to kill himself. Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap. But you know what, grandpa Rick? He's strong, and he's never going to give up. Uhhuh, yeah, I don't care. Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don't care. So? So have fun not caring.  I always do.  Good. Yeah, it is good. It's the best. I'm sure it is.  Bye.  Later. I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child. Yeah, uh Give me a sec. These are the forms for the employee health plan. All right, yeah, put  put them on my Eh. I just got bored. Everybody out. All right, just one more rally, then I promise we'll get back to your science project. Dad, Pluto isn't a planet. It's shrinking because of corporations. Yeah, that's what that antiplanet nut job Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion Plutonians are wrong? You said science wasn't easy. I said science isn't always easy. Obviously, that means sometimes it is easy. Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son. Dad, their whole planet is dying. Ha! You called it a planet. Checkmate. What's up, Pluto? Mr. Smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me. Go on. My very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the "pickles" is Pluto. My god, the man's a genius. Um, excuse me. Morty, what? Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto science reader linking Plutoquakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinkage to deepcore Plutonium drilling? Well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage? I mean, I'm trimming the hedges, and these things are just hanging there. Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them? Good one, dad. Hey, Morty, you want to go on a Oh. Hey, Beth. Hello? Hey, Jerry, you in here being stupid? Thanks. Hey, you know, I was thinking, you know, I might watch a movie. I am not programmed for friendship. Suit yourself. Hey. Hey. Wwwhat's going on? Um, listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project? Whatever. Jerry, you must be so excited. The Plutobel prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive. I'm flattered and humbled. Oh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet. People like that. Your highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers. You animals! Animals! Ooh, look who's little journey's come to an end. Take him to Plutonamo bay. You can't kill the truth, father. What? I can see you're confused. Plutonamo bay is a military prison a sort of play on words. Did he call you "father"? Scroopy Noopers, the antiplanet nut job, is your son? The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf. It's a what? Huh? Oh, planet. "Pluto is a cold, cold planet". That's what I meant. Knock them dead out there, you. Pluto is Not a planet. Ow! It's not a planet. Hey! It's not a planet! I'm an idiot, and I love my son. It was a long six hours, but we've overhauled "Needful Things" into the globallycompliant web 4.0, "enomenon", "n33dful.com", spelled with threes instead of "e"'s.  Whoo, yeah!  Whoo, excited! Okay, that's it. We just got bought by Google! Mm. I'm so proud of you, Lucius. So, how much did we make? "We". This is my business. Security! You're Zuckerberging me? I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped. I'm the devil, bitch! What, what?! Hey! Hey!  Hey, Morty.  Oh, oh, hey, dad. Um, what  what are you doing back from Pluto so quick? Uh Some people just can't handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I'm not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again. Hey, dad. Nobody's smarter than Rick, but nobody else is my dad. You're a genius at that. Wow. That's humbling and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an eightplanet solar system? Um I'm just gonna take this thing in and get an "A". Butter. But You're a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you're ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14  I got a computer in here, you know? Oh, I  I think I understand. You're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man. I get it. Say no more. I mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna end up seeing something. I got it! Noted. Good night. How's your pretend grandpa doing, aka "the devil"? He dumped me. Oof. Sorry. Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing? Not sure. Maybe in a much bigger way, mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty, and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval?  No, that's dumb.  Yeah, not satisfying. I'll tell you what, though. If  if  if it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, totally. Let's do it.  X gonna give it to ya what?   Wait for you to get it on your own,   X gonna deliver to ya   knock knock, open up the door, it's real   with the nonstop pop pop and stainless steel   go hard, getting busy with it   but I got such a good heart   that I'll make the mother wonder if he did it   damn right, and I'll do it again,   'cause I am right so I gots to win   break bread with the enemy   but no matter how many cats I break bread with   I'll break who you   And that's how I took my storefront into the forefront of the up front. Thank you, Seattle. Rick? Summer? Stupid mother [beep]. You stupid bitch. How do you like that? Wwwhy? Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.  We did it.  Yeah, bro. We totally worked it.  Yeah.  We just pulled it off. Yeah, bro. Yeah.  Bitch, please, if the only thing you cats did was came out to play   stay out my way, mother   first we gonna rock, then we gonna roll   then we let it pop, don't let it go   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   first we gonna rock, then we gonna roll   then we let it pop, don't let it go   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   ain't never gave nothing to me  Corrections by XhmikosR
So, dad, guess what tomorrow is.  Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. No.  Well, it might be.  It is. Fine. But also, tomorrow is your oneyear anniversary back in our lives. I'm gonna make you flyingsaucershaped pancakes. Oh, ttthere's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine. Oh, my God! Oh, what is happening?!  Happy anniversary, dad.  Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers. II should be making you breakfast for putting up with me. You should be making us a whole restaurant. Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around. I just wish I got to see more of you. Rick Sanchez of earth dimension C137, you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the transdimensional council of Ricks.  Hey! What the heck?!  Neutralize the Jerry. Wait! No! I'll  Dad!  Dad!  Rick! Everybody, relax. If I know these aholes, and I am these aholes, they just want to haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let's get it over with. Bring his Morty.  Oh, man.  Leave my Morty out of this. You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to j join the council. Wwwwhat about Jerry? Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot? Give you anything! I have a rare antiquecoin collection! Just don't hurt me! Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2D2s instead of George Washington.  Our son's been abducted!  You hate me for buying those coins!  Geez, Rick, wwhat is this place?  The citadel of Ricks. It's the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks. Council of Ricks? As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat  galactic terrorists, a few subgalactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government. Wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa, and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem, so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo! Answers. Hey! What do you know? It's a cowboy version of me. Geez, you're easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick, and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who's who of who's you and me. Turn your boring, old Morty into a hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers. Hey, check this out. Show me the Morty. Dumb. Excuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured  Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place. I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick. Save your antiRick speech for the council of Ricks, terrorRick. Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheepRicks, Rickpig.  [beep] me, pal.  [beep] you? No, no, no, no, no. [beep] me. Bring up the holograms. their own timelines an unprecedented Rickicidal epidemic. What say you, earth Rick C137? You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe? You have a history of noncooperation with the council. Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick. Wwwwwwhy isn't he here in handcuffs? Because he's dead, too! Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you're the malcontent, the rogue. I'm the Rick, and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government, so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me. Yeah, murmur it up, dbags. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste, and I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like Fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top, and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence! So, as they say in Canada, peace oot! Evidence! Good idea. Scan his portal gun! Oh, come on. Don't look at another man's portalgun history. We  we all go to weird places. Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occurred. What?! That's Rickdiculous! I'm obviously being set up. Earth Rick C137, the council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp. Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls. I've heard enough. Run, Morty! Unhunh. Not you. Aaaah! No! Oh! Oh! Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please. White people. No, no, no, no. Black people. And hispanic on half. Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair, please. High chair. No, no, no, no. Recliner. And wheelchair on half. They could have gone into any one of these.  Son of a  Oh, geez.  Oh, man!  We lost 'em. Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please. Cellphone. No, no, no, no. Rotary. And pay phone on half. That'll keep 'em busy for a while. Those guys were wrong, right? Yyyyou you wouldn't kill yourself  yourselves. Of course not, Morty. How could that profit me? But someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names  by finding the real Rickkiller. I'm scared, Rick. Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons, like that show "doomsday preppers". Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now. All right, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is gonna trace his location. You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer. Who wants lemonade? Oh, yeah. Mmm! Oh! Delicious! Beth you're a treasure. I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what? She's not as brilliant or attractive. Aw. Thank you. Oh! She did! She did it! Hhello?  Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.  Rick! Hey. What's  what's up? So, listen, the heat's on, and there's nowhere left to turn, so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole.  What?!  Is that cool with you, dawg? Rick, no!  Morty!!  We got it. The call's coming from  inside the house  Look at his face! You dummy! Can't believe our daughter married you. Too easy! The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won't be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored, they'll be onto us. Phones Ã  la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls.  Anything else?  Yeah, more phone sticks, please. Right away, sir. You know, Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought, "Gee, that kind of devalues our bond". But then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines. Yeah, it's got to be that way.  You're a camouflage.  Camouflage? What are you talking about, Rick? Ricks have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near someone with complementary brain waves that make ours invisible. See, when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get canceled out by the, uh Morty waves. Um Because oour personalities are so different? Oh, shit, dawg. My portal gun was hacked remotely, Morty obviously by the real killer, to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on. Let's go.  Uhoh.  Excuse me. We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion, I'm gonna mark us each with a red "X" right now. That way, if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying. Hey, check it out. Damn it!  Hey, you didn't pay your bill!  The red "X"! Red "X"! Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats and your favorite kind of shirt in stock, huh, Morty? Yeah, Rick, II heard you the first time. You don't have to keep saying it over and over. Man, this place is way off the grid. This guy does not want to be found. Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn't that what Mortys are  human cloaking devices? Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is. Oh, my God, Rick, look! There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building! Not people, Morty  Mortys. Oh, God! Wwwhy would somebody do this? It's horrible! Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats, but you get  you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put them in agonizing pain, that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks [beep]. I fiddled with a concept like this once. On paper, Morty. On paper. I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with, like, five Mortys and a jumper cable. Which I also wouldn't do! I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship.  Coffee time!  Yeah! Yo, yo, yo, yo! That's what I like to hear!  Hi, Jerry.  Leave me alone. I'm working. Oh, you are? Wwwwhat do you do? II'm  I'm in between advertising jobs. Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy, and then yyyou help 'em? Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy who really has it all together. Dude, are you  w you're being a dick, right? Oh, gosh, II hope not. I wouldn't want to offend you in any way. You're really a Rick? Y of course I am  just as much as my Morty's a Morty. Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie "mask." You know, the one with Cher in it? That's right, Jerry! He  he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz "mask" people. He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty. They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I'd love them if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry. Hey, get a load of this. Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick. This is perfect. I'm not doofus Rick! I'm Rick j19zeta7! Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right? Hey, I don't eat poop! Yyou guys are always so mean to me. I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry. I'm the worst Rick of them all. According to who  other versions of you? If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you got to stop listening to yourself. Wow. You really are wise, Jerry. III guess that's why you work in advertising. The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all. You don't care about me at all! I'm no different than that jacket you've got on! Yyy oor your stupid portal gun! I'm just a tool! III'm just an object! Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now, for the love of God, be quiet. The point of this is to get the drop on the guy. You know what, Rick? I'll tell you something! I'm more than a human shield! Yeah, that's right. You are. You're a perfect, impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty, because you're as dumb as I am smart, which is why when I say "shut up," it's really good advice. Great. Nice work, Morty. Ooh. Look at you, C137. You  aren't you a tough customer. The slow clap? Really? Kind of played out, dude. Not in this dimension, it isn't. In fact I invented it. Nobody else has ever even done it here before. Well, ladida. Hey, that's mine! I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty.  We got to escape.  I'm not gonna help you, Rick.  Yyou're a monster.  Don't be Rickdiculous, Morty. Will you  will you stop saying that? It's stupid. Take his Morty away. Come with me. Yeah, gladly. Geez, man. Ricks, huh? Hey, man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we could shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside? It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick. In here.  Ah. Isn't it beautiful?  Yeah, yeah. Looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!  That guy got it.  Unhunhunh, Rick. Quiet. You're missing my symphony. Hey, I'll take it over Mumford & Sons. Zip! This guy is on it! He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That's just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds. You see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We're not so different, you and I. Yeah, duh! See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers. I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed them out from most evil to least evil. Here's where I am. And look it  right here's where you are, Rick. This guy right here  superweird. I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you're going with this? 'Cause that's where I'd be going. Please. I think I'm doing pretty good on my own. I'm simply gonna download the contents of your brain and then kill you. Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate Ovenless brownies! Mmm. Mmm! It's incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order. Well, come on. I can't take all the credit, Jerry.  It was your idea.  Come here, Jerry! Hey, uh, come here. II want to show you something. Okay, look, everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but you're a genius scientist. What do you think? See? There's little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be. You know, Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that these will increase in value or even hold their current value. The truth is, you bought them because you like them. They have value to you. That's what matters.  How long are you staying?  Until we find your Rick. I found mine.  Help!  There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world. So, what  you're just gonna give up? We're giving in  to the power of the one true Morty. One day, he will return. Praise the one true Morty. Ugh. All right, Mortys, listen up. My name is Morty Smith, from earth dimension C137. I know you're scared, because I'm scared. But that's no reason to accept our fate! We're Mortys! We're not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own! This sounds like something the one true Morty might say. I'm sick of being a human shield. I want to be a gardener! I want to write really crazy, intense action novels! I'm more than just a hammer! He is the one true Morty! Hooray! The one true Morty! Hey, keep it down! You've lived quite a life, Rick. It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.  You're crying? Over a Morty?  No, I'm just allergic to dipshits. Ugh. Pathetic. We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys. Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do IIIIit! Morty! Thank God! Get me out of this. Come on! You're lucky I'm not a Rick. Point taken, but this is no time for arcs. Oh! Yeah, hello. Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common? Huh? Wwho is this? I found the real killer, bitch! Get over here! Yo, dingdong, we're done here. Time to go. Well, Jerry, I guess this means goodbye. Wwwell, does it have to? I mean, you  you look just like Rick. We could maybe, you know, get rid of him. I'm not saying kill him, necessarily. I  I'm also not saying necessarily not kill him, but  Jerry, wwe both know it wouldn't work. It's time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love you. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Wwhat  wwhat's gonna happen to all these Mortys? They'll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls. Poor little rickless bastards. Earth Rick C137, the council apologizes for its false accusation, and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty in the event that your current Morty should  Uh, guys, not a good time. Come on, Morty. Let's hit it. Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass. All right, Morty. Don't break an arm jerking yourself off. Man, I can't believe you, Rick. That right there, that w that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity, you know?  To connect with me a little.  Hey, Morty, you want connection, go be part of some stupid club, like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don't connect because I'm the rickest Rick there is. And, you know, it would g Go without saying that the rickest Rick would have the Mortyest Morty.  It would go without saying, huh?  Yeah, it would.  Did you hear me say it?  Nah. The Mortyest Morty. Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster brown. A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems. It can be a real bad thing for everybody. Oh, yeah? How's that? Uuh, I'll explain when you're older.  What a mess.  Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved. What is that? Hand me the laser difibulator. Hey, guys, uh, ccan I help? No! Go clean the toilets. Maybe you'll make friends with some turds. You make us ashamed to be ourselves! My God. I've seen this technology before. This Rick was being controlled remotely  puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver. Yeah, but where's the transmitter?  Wubba dubba dub dub!  Oh. Hey, Jerry. What are you doing in my room, buddy? Nothing. I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors. All right. Okay, get out. What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh, my God, this is rich! I've got like 10 Ricks to call right now.
Bye, mom! Bye, dad!  Drive carefully! Have fun, you two. Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our Titanic themed getaway. Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic. Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here. I know, ccan we wrap this up? Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage. Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and no more adventures with Morty. Aw, geez, Rick. If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time. That's right. Wait. What? Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song "blomp blompa noop noop anoop noop noop". You guys know that song? From tiny rogerts? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s? Nonobody? Aall right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip. Not one thing out of place. Not a single thing. Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party. Corrections by XhmikosR I found jello. Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said? Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty. Rick, tell summer she can't have a party! Uh, summer, you can't have a party. Because I'm having a party, bIIIitch! Oh, what?! Rick, you can't! What do you mean you're having a party? Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something? "Glip glop?" You're lucky a traflorkian doesn't hear you say that. Is that like their nword? It's like the nword and the cword had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and  screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids. That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17. Why do you party? To get wrwriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son! Just keep your SciFi friends away from my awesome ones. Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths. A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink? I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is ununsinkable. Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow! Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read. Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit? Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio. This is where rose says, "I'm flying, Jack!" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone. Well, what about her? Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line? I, uh  I could get into trouble. We won't tell. So  You're a Titanic fanatic?  Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate. Happy to help rose. I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it Brad! Hey! Yo. Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk. Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool. The beacon was activated. Who is in danger? Ugh! Grandpa! Birdperson! I am pleased there is no emergency. Oh, there's an emergency, all right. A emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers? It has been a challenging mating season for birdperson. Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. Go have some fun out there birdp bird birdperson. Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick? Uh people? Mm, six. Yo! What up, my glip glops?! Oh, man! Oh! Yyyou know there's a garbage, right? Hey, uh, what the hell?! Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. Oh, oh, g oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed! Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit. Oh. Okay. Sssorry. Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?! The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all. Uhhuh. Yeah. No, no, tototally.  Rick, you got to stop   Morty!  Have you met gearhead?  Hey, how's  Morty here, he  he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly? Uh Not at all. Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about Oh, hey, Morty! Hhave you  have you met my buddy scropon? Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed! Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed. Have a little perspective. Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro! Aw! Squanchy! Is there a good place for me to squanch around here? Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man.  Mi casa es su casa, dawg!  All right! I like your squanch! Uh, Rick, what exactly is "squanching"? Morty, listen  we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax. Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures! Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later? Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, whwhwhat's in this for me? For me? Jessica. Knock it off, slow mobius! Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro! I can't believe she's here. Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood. Oh, Rose. Whee! Is that what I think it is? Yes, every couple gets to recreate Jack's drowning at the end of the movie. It's so romantic. I can't wait to do that with Beth. I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested. Look! Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. Uh, sir? There's not a problem. What do you mean there's not a problem? The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg! Well, do something! Steer into it! I'm trying! It's too late. Ladies and gentlemen Don't brace yourselves. No! No! What happened?! Their rail system must have failed. Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! Totally gonna get laid tonight. I like your feathers. They are designed to attract the attention of the female. It's working. Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate. I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for I believe birdperson can arrange that. Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while. Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her. Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here. Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. Everybody should be welcome. Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? I thought everyone was welcome. It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac  just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser. Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being. But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! Whoa. What's up, man? I have no quarrel with you, boy. "Boy"? What's that supposed to mean? It's just  llook, II don't know how you thought I meant it, but Don't look at me, dude. Look, I'm halfAbraham Lincoln, so  So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?! Well, no, but  You know?  What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years? Leave him alone, Brad. Stay out of this, Jessica! Kick his ass, Brad! Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Brad! Rick! I just did you a favor, Morty. Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends. Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet. Jessica, can I show you something? Wow! Look at all this stuff. Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's SciFi workshop. Check this out. It's beautiful. You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you. What's that, Morty? I think that you're the most  No, that  those weird sounds coming from the closet over there.  Oh, my God!  Aah! Hey, I'm squanching in here! Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting! Ow! Oh! Oh, crap! Huh. Big star in the sky. Oxygenrich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. We'll be fine! Let's party!  Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got  I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now. Oh, man. Yyou hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer oon that one. How are you guys not freaking out right now?! Tthe whole house is sitting in another dimension! II mean, wwhat the hell are we supposed to do?! Mmmom and dad are gonna kill us!  I'm losing it here, Rick!  Relax, Morty, relax! It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. Oh, shit, mother [beep]! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here. Okay. Let's go, then. Wwwe got to go get those crystals right now, Rick. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, II can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what  what if somebody breaks something? Yeah. Me too. I should stay. You guys have any aspirin? Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you. Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere.  I'm injured.  Shut up, Lincoler. It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room. Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too. What? Why  why me? Because, uh, you're  you're so good at playing the flute. Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings. Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken. I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. But  but  You see, Jerry? May I show you something? Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater. I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a "Titanic" failure. Get it? Ooh!  Draw me, Jerry.  Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind. But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years. Um, not like this. Not  not with you.  You are gonna draw me.  Aah! Then you're going to [beep] me in that car over there. It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time  Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close. There they are! Wait. Something's not right. Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! Summer's gonna like me again. Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here! Mein journey is over, Morty. I have something important to tell you.  And the gears, they turned for a thousand years   until the dark day that they stopped  Rick, I got them!  I got the crystals!  All right!  You did it, Morty.  Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father. He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died. Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals. And these babies just saved this lameass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something. Wait a minute. What?  Put your right foot forward   and your left foot back   then slide around   like on a nordictrack   move to the left   step to the right   wiggle your elbows, and look   up into the light   it's the, it's the   it's the Rick dance   it's the, it's the   it's the Rick dance  Slow mobius, hit me with the clock beam!  It's the, it's the   it's the Rick dance  That's the Rick dance! All right! Whoa, man! What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something! What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty. Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. That's what I think of your crystals, Rick! Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more klax? Bbirdperson? Uh, squanchy? Don't squaunch at me. All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now. All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks! Boo! You suck, whatever your name is. Boo! Morty, you're the worst, Morty. But these gears just started turnin'. Almost finished, Jerry? Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes. I'm sure it's good enough. Move! Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier. But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me. No mess. No clean. Beth! Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now. I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist. What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blisterpocked lips? What? Well, at least you got all this free stuff. Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while. I'm not going to fit. Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and  Jerry, just leave the door. It's not a door, Beth.  It's debris.  I don't care. Just leave it. Yeah. Okay. "Cape fear"! "Cape fear"! I'm  I'm doing  I'm  I'm going to do like from "cape fear". Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place! Cool. I'm coming, too. Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party. What? Nancy told us what a bitch you are. Guys, seriously. Nancy? Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, Iit was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for. Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. You're so wise. May I assist you with that? Uh, sure, yeah. Thanks. Morty, do you know what "wubba lubba dub dub" means? Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase. It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, "I am in great pain. Please help me." Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically. No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself. Come on, um Birdperson. Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole. Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever. You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. I'm sick of having adventures with Rick. My people have another saying "gubba nub nub doo rah kah". It means, "whatever lets you sleep at night". Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner. This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy! Caw! Wow. We are so screwed.  Rick, wake up.  Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop. Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home. Uh, all  all right. All right. Hold  hold on. Ahh! So good. Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway.  Bring me the thing.  What  what thing? The thing. The thing. The  the  it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It  it  it beeps. Rick! That describes everything in your garage! Do you mean this? Summer for for the win. All right, that should do it. Whoa! What did you do? Uh, ssee for yourself. Whoa! Yeah, eeverything's frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that.  For how long?  I don't know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month? Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?  Worst movie ever.  Dumb. Ooh, boy, what a waste of time. Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen. This has been so much fun. Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that "wubba lubba dub dub" thing that you usually say. Don't need to. I have a new catchphrase. Oh, yeah? What  what's that, Rick? I love my grandkids.  Aww.  Psych! Just kidding  my new catchphrase is, "I don't give a [beep]".  Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got   just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got  Roll credits!  Just shake that a Roll the credits! Go!  Just shake that ass That's the end of season one! That's the end, mother [beep]! "I don't give a [beep]" is my new catchphrase! [Beep] you! That's season one! Boom! Season one up in your face, mother [beep]! Yeah! Revenge. What?! Party! Whoo, baby! Please, stop! Hey, brah! I don't understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this? Yeah, you know it, dawg! Whoo, baby! Corrections by XhmikosR
Hurry up, Morty. Grandpa's about to unfreeze time. You really should be cleaning from top to bottom. I know how to vacuum mom and dad, Summer. I've been doing it for six months. Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew? It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day. You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared grandpa Rick might make me his new sidekick?  What?! What kind of monster are you?  A competent one. Who cares about the things you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time was to stop giving a [bleep]. Put a shirt on your dumb dad, and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing. All right, listen, you two. We froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize. Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean? It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. Uh, I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents, or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.  Wait a minute, what?  And away we go!  Um did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?  Shhh.  Shush, Morty. A thing or two about Wait, what? Was the house When we pulled up, I could have sworn the house was completely trashed. Negative visualization, Jerry. Explains a lot about where you're at.  Hi, sweetie.  Hi, dad. Summer, Morty, are you okay?  We we just missed you a lot.  Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you, though. Yeah, it would literally destroy them. Now, listen, why don't Why don't Why don't you guys go get a free Sunday ice cream? Get out there and get some ice creams. Here's $500 cash in unmarked monies. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and kick it on over to ya.  You guys go nuts.  This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket. Sweetie, is your shirt on backwards? Yeah. I like it this way. I'm not stupid.  Phew!  Oh. Man, that guy is the Redgren Grumbholdt of pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh, you agree, huh?  It's funny. You like that Redgren Grumbholdt reference?  Yeah.  Well, guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep. God, I feel terrible. Yep, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam! Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under Uh, what? It was your job, Morty.  Nuhuh!  Yuhhuh! Actually, sorry, Summer. I got to back the "m" bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies. Your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson. Boom! In your face, Summer! You really dropped the ball, man. Shut up, Morty, you vindictive little turd! You shut up, you big female asshole! Hey, don't shove me!  I didn't!  You didn't what?  What's your problem?  What's yours?  Shut up!  You shut up! Whwhoa, whoa! What the hell, hell, hell, hell, hell? Oh, God. Oh, no. What did you guys just do?  What did who do?  What do you mean?  Wait, what am I saying?  Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now? Oh, man, I don't feel good.  Am I me?  Am I talking right now?  I think so.  Wait, who said that? All right, both of you just don't move. Don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.  What'd you do, Morty?  I'm gonna help grandpa. What do you mean you're gonna help him? I can help, too.  What's happening, grandpa?  What's going on, Rick? Shshshut up. Oh, crap, are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!  What are you talking about?  What's that mean?  English, please.  English? Our time is fractured You two somehow created a feedback look of uncertainty that split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities. Wwe're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female coworker. We're entirely hypothetical. But I thought there were infinite time lines? We're not on any time line, dummy. Look. Oh, my God! Are those cats? I assume they're SchrÃ dinger's cats. Or, actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.  Is the world gone?  Is the world gone?  Where are mom and dad?  What about mom and dad? Mom and dad? Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless, grounded story about their [bleep] marriage. Cold stone creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining $20? You realize they sing no matter how much you tip?  Whoa!  Aaah! Holy [bleep]!  What happened?  I hit a deer. We we have to tell the cops you were driving.  What?  This is rum raisin!  It's still alive.  Well, do we Do I, uh, get, uh, a big rock, or? It's not an armadillo, asshole. I thought that's what a man's supposed to say. It's not like I could've actually done it. If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I I think we have to just It's okay. This is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do? You're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon. So? Well, don't different animals Require different levels of skill to keep alive?  Oh, God.  Get the deer in the car, Jerry. Yes, Beth. This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible. And you did it so we could clean the house after a party? Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like, literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually, everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be "is".  Or?  We isn't. All right, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.  How do you know  How do you know that Whatever your asking me, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go. Huh, what do you know. It's working.  Ow, ow, ow!  Oh [bleep]. What the hell is wrong with you two? IIII mean you four! That hurt! That was painful. Good, I'm glad it was painful. You deserve it. I saw you. Yyou're both all over the damn place. We've been split for 20 minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum [bleep] wind? What the hell do either of you two have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything?  Come on, spit it out!  Well, you don't exactly make it easy, Rick. You make fun of me all the time You're always picking on me And now Summer's doing it and now you got Summer to kiss your ass. Me?! What about you? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous Could you get more excited to see me fail? Because you want grandpa all to yourself! All right, all right, cool it. I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, and you both want to be grandpa's favorite. I can fix this. Morty, sit here. Summer, you sit here. Now, listen. I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my white board. This has been a long time coming, anyway. Emergency! Wounded deer coming in. Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here. I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention.  Nurse, please move that snake.  That's my nurse. And as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs. As a vet, I'm sure you know that a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor. So let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out.  It's time to save a life!  Geez. That's odd. This deer's wounded. Uh, yeah, I was there. You don't have to rub it in. I mean it's been shot with a gun. My gun. May I help you, sir? No, but you can stop helping this deer. I shot it before these two hit it with their car, and I followed them when they hauled it off. This deer belongs to me. We don't have time for this, okay? I need anaesthetic and deer saline. Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting, or euthanizing them, or also when eating them at also any meal. I'm calling my lawyer. I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter. In your dreams, bitch. Scalpel. So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical, birdbrained homunculi. And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. All right, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world.  Yes.  Yes. All right, perfect. Sit still. Arms down. I'm gonna do this again. This time be like grandpa. You mean drunk? What's that? You got something to say?  No.  And away we go! And away we go!  Huh, that's weird.  Huh, that's weird.  Oh, my God.  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!  What?!  The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!  What?! Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath.  Don't you get it?!  Don't you get it?! The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it was always in the back of my mind, too. The difference is I would never do it, until now.  Rick, what the hell are you doing?  Saving our lives! After he takes me out, he's He's gonna be coming for you.  Who?  Me! Aah!  Whoa!  You see that? Get down! I told you, he's a psycho. He's lost it! Ththththe time fracture must have made him crazy!  I don't know what to do!  Oh, crap! I don't know what to do! Oh, God, now there's three of them. We're outnumbered. Get in the cupboards. Wait, don't don't do that. They'll know. Wait, wait. Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really. Is this what you want, you sick [bleep]?! You want to see children die?! You son of a bitch. You don't stop living until I say so! Michael.  Who's this now?  My lawyer. I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies. It's called Brad's law. We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point, you're performing it on venison. Actually, I've decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict I'm sure it's ruined the meat. I'm just gonna use the head for my recroom wall. She normally works on horses. Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the [bleep] out of here. I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back! Jesus. Shh, shh! I know where you are, you creepy old monster. I know how you think. Oh, is there where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well, maybe you're right. Holy [bleep] now what? Well, if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?  Right.  Okay. So, from now on, whatever we do, we have to be certain. Right. I think I'm certain we're effed in the "a". Oh, God, my head. What did you guys do? We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy and you caused another time fracture. You tried to kill yourself. Oonly in selfdefense. Myself tried to kill me first. Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well, actually, I do expect you to understand that. It's basic math. Ccan somebody just let me out of here? If I die in a cage, I lose a bet. Well, is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore? Oh, for God's sake. All right, here.  Give me the time crystal.  Whwhat are you doing? Calling myself. Here, listen. It'll probably go to voicemail since, you know, I'm calling myself.  Hello, Rick here.  Don't fall for it. It's a bit. Just kidding! Ha, ha! You just got ricked.  You've reached Rick's voicemail.  You know what to do. Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it, too. Take it easy. Whoa, damn! Look at this. I'm blowing up Three new voicemails. Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard this one. Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Hey, Rick, it's You get the idea. Wwe're cool now. Okay, well, we're still not gonna let you out of this crate. Fine. I'll just do it myself. If you could get out that whole time, why didn't you? Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds. You know, geez, Rick! Yyyou're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.  Holy!  A monster! Hey, you hey, quit yelling. Quit yelling. What the [bleep] Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time twice. How did this happen? Shut the [bleep] up. Oh, damn. I'm from the fourth dimension. I can hear all of y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second. Hey, damn it. Were you trying to use this to Oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standing in it, you dumbass threedimensional monkeyass dummies? Oh, way to go, Rick. Yeah, grandpa, way to go. What, you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head. He came here in a bubble. For all we know, he could be the David Berkowitz of nutsackland. Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all are just Just just negligent. See, now Now look right here. Hey, hey, hey, the three of you, put your collars on.  We have them on.  What are you talking about?  Uh, we did.  We're not wearing collars. Exactly. 'Cause you're being obstinate. What? Put the damn collars on if you want to live.  They're on right now.  We did. They're on. All right, fine. Summer, Morty, put them on.  Yes, we're back!  No more cats!  We're back in certain time.  Problem solved. No more cats! Oh, you did it!  You fixed it.  Yeah, I did. Now keep those collars on so you don't break your weakass time again. How long, exactly, do we have to wear these things? They're really embarrassing. Well, since you're going to time prison, I'd say you can keep them on forever.  Time prison?  Yeah. Well, I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way your dumbass assin' ass asses could ever have on is if it was stolen. You stole a timefreezing crystal from testicle monsters?! I would've been happy to pay for it, s Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him! No, no, no, no! You better keep back! Man, this will turn your ass into a thirdtrimester fetus from 30 yards. Mm. Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure? That's right, Mrs. Smith. Give in to your anger. Neglect that deer. Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of elk, moose, deer, and stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border. Where your jurisdiction ends. I guess that's the end of that. There is just one more thing. According to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. You heard the man, horse doctor. You have to say you couldn't hack it. We did it! Uhhuh. No, mother no. Earth, dude. No, I'm talking about Yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you get to the dolphin people, you gone too far. All right, man, I'll talk to you later. Okay. You know what they do to thirddimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever. Why are you doing this? You think I want to be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions, man. Bringing you guys in is my ticket up. What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?  You really think I'm that stupid?  All right, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Okay, well, then that means there's a 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you. I cannot argue that. Aaah! Oh, God, gross and weird! Chris! You killed my gun! Summer, Morty, take off your collars.  What?  What the hell are you doing? Good question. I suppose the answer is I'm not certain. Oh, no, what are you doing?  I have no idea.  I'm not sure. Stop it! Maybe I will, maybe I won't. I'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass. List hey! Tw ow! But these arms are vestigial! Now, you poked me where an eye would've been about 6 million years ago. Come on, let's help grandpa. Yes! I'm 100% not sure about anything! Yeah, totally uncertain. Beat his ass! Get him! Beat him up!  Kick his ass, Rick!  Die, mother[bleep]! Ow! I'm defeated.  What's happening?  Time is falling apart. We've got to get back to certainty quick. Give me your collars. Oh, man. Don't you have to fix, like, 30 of them? Morty, I have to fix three of them. And then there's 31 other versions of me that have to also fix three, for a total of 96. I'm not an idiot. I know how to be decisive.  Now hand me that flathead screwdriver.  Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver.  Actually, make it a flathead.  Actually, make it a Phillips. Oh, shit. Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer. And I know you wanted to be the one to save it. Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego? Well, you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married. Where are we going? One last stop. Where's the helicopter? There is no helicopter. And there is no Cervine Institute. But the top deer surgeon I'm looking at her. Thanks for teeing me up like that. You better get moving. These lights are designed for basic icecream work. They're not gonna last all night. I need five minutes. Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had. Thanks to cold stone creamery. You're welcome. Okay, collars are done. Put them on. We're out of time. It's ironic, huh? Huh? Wait a minute.  Great.  Rick! What's going on? The collar. Oh, the latch is broken. It won't latch closed around my neck.  Oh, are you kidding me?  Geez, what's going on? How come our collars aren't green? Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on, and one of me is stuck trying to help him. Don't blame this on me. You're the one that couldn't fix a latch. What are you talking about? It's not broken, Morty. I fixed it. Just put it on. It won't close. It's broken. Fine, bring it here. Oh!  Rick!  Morty! Oh, really, Morty? Well, I'm sorry. I'm not the one who's so [bleep] uncertain about everything. You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this. I never want to see you again! You're never gonna see anything again, you little dummy! You killed us! God damn it.  Rick! Oh! Morty, where's your collar? I'll fix it. I dropped it. What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty? I'm okay with this. Be good, Morty. Be better than me. Oh [bleep] the other collar! I'm not okay with this. I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus, please let me live. Oh, my God, I have to I've got to fix this thing. Please, God in heaven. Please, God. Oh, lord, hear my prayers. Yes! [Bleep] you, God! Not today, bitch! Please, God, if there's a hell, please be merciful to me. Yes, I did it! There is no God! In your face! One dot, mother[bleep]!  Yes!  Oh, yes! All right, you know what I'm talking about.  Oh, that was a close call.  Oh, yeah! I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty.  Oh, yeah, do it.  Check me out. I'm doing the cabbage patch.  Do it right.  I'm doing it, too.  Do the cabbage patch.  It's a classic dance.  Do it. Do the dance.  Oh [bleep] look at that. Hey, wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here? I don't know. I think, like, It's hard to keep straight now that I have 63 other memories of everything. Yeah. But I feel like one of the 64 Ricks, like, sacrificed himself for me?  Maybe? I think?  Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little piece of shit. Hey, guys, we're home. Mom! Dad! Uh, hold the phone. Where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three. Am I right? Are you guys Power Rangers, but only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Cleanup in the fruit aisle. Not in a homophobic way, though. They're just fruity necklaces is what I was saying. I'm gonna pee my pants!  Somebody call the planet of "tron"!  Doesn't feel so good, does it?  We have three "tron" people over here.  No, it doesn't. It hurts. Seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles with green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the '90s? What is this, a '90s nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie "The Craft" with Fairuza Balk? Hey, man, when the hell were you?  Looking for you, asshole.  I told you past the dinosaurs. You know how much time is past the dinosaurs? Half of all time! Come on, man. It's this way.  Come on.  Give me that thing. Speed it up. He can't be this far back. No, no, there he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. Stop, stop.  So, that's the guy, huh?  Yeah, that's him. Hey, man. Remember me? I got something for your ass. Don't mess with time! You don't [bleep] with time! Mother[bleep]! I will mess with time. I will mess with time. Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
Learning to fly this thing, Morty, is gonna be really liberating. You know, you're gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.  Cool.  See that planet right there? Don't fly too close to that planet. Someone will come out and try to wash your windshield. Hold on. Yeah? Yeah, I have it. Where do you want to meet? All right, cool. All right, Morty, lesson's over. We got some business to attend to a few light minutes south of here. Oh, you still use south in space? Whoa! Jesus, Jerry! What the hell are you doing here?! What are you talking about? We agreed a boy's father should be present  when he's learning to drive.  I guess I remember that. Wow. And you've just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well, we don't have time to take him to earth, Morty. Head for 3924917. Cool! Looks like I'm coming along for an adventure! Yep.  This is where we're going?  Nope. This is. You can park in a handicap spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here. Well, look at this fella. Aren't you handsome? Thank you.  I'm Jerry.  Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship? I'm traveling with my son and fatherinlaw. Wwait. Are they coming? Oh, they'll be back soon. What?! I don't know how this works! Help me! What the hell?! I know, right? Oh, what the hell?! I know, right? Jerryboree!? You created a day care for my dad? Are you kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well, I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy's rich. Don't forget to check the reason for your dropoff. Trust me, Morty, I've heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don't tend to last five minutes off of earth. This is a totally unregistered crosstemporal asteroid. Here, they can romp and play with other Jerrys. He couldn't be safer. Hey, Morty, hang on to this. That number's your dad. If you lose it, we're not gonna be able to get him back.    Okay, wait here.  I want to come with. Don't come with. It's boring. It's it's business stuff. What kind of business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady. Right, yeah, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street, Morty? Yyou know what those guys do in their fancy boardrooms? They take their balls and they dip them in cocaine and wipe them all over each other. You know, grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public, because grandpa isn't shady. Aw, crap. Hey, what's up? Hey, Rick! Here you go 3,000 flerbos. Do you have the weapon? Ccan we please? This is my grandson, Morty. Oh, hi, Morty. I'm Krombopulos Michael. I'm an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa. Here. Go away. Ooh! Yeah, this looks deadly. So, this shoots antimatter? My target can't be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty. Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered, please give me a call.  I'm very discreet.  You're ggiving him a card?! I have no code of ethics. I will kill anyone, anywhere children, animals, old people doesn't matter. I just love killing. You sell weapons to killers for money? You've got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It's more complicated out here. These are flerbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish  with 3,000 of these?  Uh, what? An entire afternoon at Blips and Chitz! Oh, this place is the best. It's got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is. You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?! Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad, Morty. Here, check this out. Aah! Roy, what's wrong? I had a nightmare. I was with an old man. He put a helmet on me. It's just a fever. Get some sleep. I don't want you missing school on Monday. I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. Now is the time in your life when anything is possible. Spiraling perfectly! It's gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20! Now he's at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy "the Rocket"! Touchdown! I just think it's time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy? Had we caught it sooner well, hindsight is 20/20, Roy. What's important is that we move quickly. I'm not ready to die. You're not going to.  Yeah! Whoo!  Yeah! Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy. Hey, Roy, you pulled those persian offwhite shags for the clearance sale? Whoa. Sh shit! Oh! Whoa! What the hell?! Wwwhere am I?!  What in the hell?!  55 years. Not bad, Morty. You kind of wasted your 30s, though, with that whole birdwatching phase.  Where's my wife?!  Morty, you were just playing a game. It's called "Roy". Snap out of it. Come on. I'm Morty. You're Rick. Hey! You sold a gun to a guy that kills people! Look at this you beat cancer, and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo! Ddon't dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hit man is the same as pulling the trigger! It's also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there's not a lot anyone can do to stop him. That's why he does it for a living. Now excuse me. It's time to thrash your "Roy" score. You know, you could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted. Uhhuh, yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Morty.  I never go back to the carpet store.  Holy shit! This guy's taking Roy off the grid! This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy! Hi. I'm sorry. I think there was a misunderstanding. I'm an adult and would like to go home, please. Well, of course. Right through that tube. Unbelievable. You're doing great. I know how to crawl in a tube. Come on. Oh. This is harder than it looks. Whoa!  Marco?  Polo! Marco? Come find me. Marco? You guys are enjoying this? Don't you feel a little patronized? How so?  Jerry!  Beth. Oh, come on. This is ridiculous. I love you, Jerry. Aw, Beth. Who wants to come watch "midnight run" with director's commentary on?  Yeah!  Definitely. First one there gets to adjust the picture setting! The factory tint setting is always too high! Out of my way. The tint setting is always too high.  Oh, boy. Here I go killing again. Aah! Aah! Arh! Aah! Aah! You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below. We're all out of offwhite Persian. Oh, man! Wwwhat have I done?!  Drop the gun.  You don't understand!  This guy was gonna kill someone!  I guess that makes two of us. Aah! What are you doing, Morty? This is a galactic federation outpost! Look, I don't have time to tell you my entire backstory, but grandpa and government don't get along. He saved my life.  What?  Huh?! Whoa! Are you Krombopulos Michael's target? Wwhat's your name? My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call "Jessica's feet" no, "telepathy". Oh, good job, Morty. Yyou killed my best customer, but you saved a mindreading fart. I like this name fart. Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain. Morty, don't do it. Morty Morty, you idiot. Oh, crap. Let's get you out of here! We can't get him out of here. He's gaseous. He's not gonna make it through a portal, Morty. Well, then, I guess we're all getting in the car.  Right, uh  Fart.  No! Just just get in the car!  Morty, come on. I want to go back to Blips and Chitz. I don't want to deal with this. Rick, you've been clear on the fact that you don't want to help, so just go away. More are coming. Screw this. I'm out. Whoa! Come on, come on! Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire! Um, um, um, um! Open fire! Aah! Stupidass, fartsaving, carpetstore mother[bleep]. Move! Wait, did you [bleep] with my seat settings? More are coming. Rick! Yeah, yeah. Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up. That's because my grandson drives like a male Obravadian. Yeah, I said it some stereotypes are based in fact. Actually, it's because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they're just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought So I've heard. Just fix it. I don't think the gromflamites can track us now, but it looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Or, you know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we could finish the job and go home.  You do understand I'm telepathic, right?  I'm being polite. Rick, we're taking him back where he belongs. Oh, yeah? Where's that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it? I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call "Get out of my head, fart. I know you're in here. Lalalala". No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula. Oh, great. Just a hop, skip, and an 800lightyear jump. You know, you can leave anytime you want, Rick. Whatever you want to do, you little punkass little bitch. Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbonbased lifeforms. You put the value of all life above your own. It's how things should be. It's how they could be. I could not agree more.  The worlds can be one together   Cosmos without hatred   Stars like diamonds in your eyes   The ground can be space   Space, space, space, space   With feet marching towards a peaceful sky   All the moon men want things their way   But we make sure they see the sun   Goodbye, moon men   You say goodbye, moon men   Goodbye  Shut the [bleep] up about moon men! This isn't a musical number. This is a [bleep] operation. We got to be cool and [bleep] lay low. Duck, duck, birdie? That's very funny! Here comes another funny. Oh, this place is great. I almost wish I could stay longer than one day. You just might. Wwhat do you mean? These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back. They live here now. Uh. No gearturnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives, reportedly at large somewhere within the gear system. Son of a Why were the gromflamites holding you prisoner? What the [bleep] is so valuable about you? I am no more valuable than life itself. However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this. That was oxygen. I added 71 protons to it. Terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is looking for us. Any species that gets ahold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. You know how inconvenient that's gonna be to my work? Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead! I'm sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you got to look out for number one. Number one is me, asshole! You're supposed to be my friend! Friend?! Do you even know my real name? It's Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire species of gear people. Calling me "gearhead" is like calling a Chinese person "Asia face". No! Not twigs! Two things I want to make clear to everybody in this room never betray me, and it's time to go. Nobody move! Oh, my god. Are those  Hey, Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people that are getting killed today because of your choices? I did the right thing, Rick!  Tell that to gearhead's gearsticles.  You did that! Wrong! I'd be playing "Roy" right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty. I can't believe Rick did this.  This is the eighth to the last straw.  Ante up. You know what? Screw it! I have a better gamble for you guys. I say we escape. If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door. You think we're kept here against our will? That would be illegal. But if you can leave, then why are you still here? Same reason as you. We're Jerrys. I'm leaving. Okay, then. That was always allowed.  Morty, take the wheel! Whoa! Whoa! Geez! Damn it, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing? I'm kidding. I know that's on me. Um, Rick! Shit. Well, I guess this is it. Morty, crack the window. I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend. Well, he'd probably like to have me to himself. That's how friends are. Or does he want herto himself?  The worlds can be one together   Cosmos without hatred   Stars like diamonds in your eyes  My life is a [bleep] joke!  Goodbye, moon men   You say goodbye, moon men   Goodbye, moon men  All right. Let's proceed. Damn. Can't blame that on the dog. Talk about silent but deadly. II've seen some nerve gas, but that this gas got nerve! You know what I'm saying?  Are you done?  I'll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind! Am I right?! If you don't like that one, Morty, an alt on that could be, like, if I said "gasablanca"! All right, I'm done. Let's get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish saving a life!  Glagga blag blag.  Um, Earth, please? Is this Do I pay? Agga blag blag blag! Oh, I'm sorry, sorry! Ohh. Hmm. Mm, hey. Aah! Agga blag blag? Oh, uh, hey. What?  Agga blag!  Uh, what do you want? Agga blag blag ohh! Uh Hey. Are you the one that left? I get it. It's a it's a hassle out there. Right? And who needs that?  Right?  Right?  Not me.  Who needs that? Ho, ho! Not us. Uh, who are you? Oh, excuse me. Paul Fleischman. Infinite timelines. In some of them, Beth remarries.  Geez.  Don't worry. I treat Beth very well, and I do not overstep my bounds with Morty. Every kid needs a dad, but there's no replacing you. Hey, you want to give us a hand with this? We're trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the TV. It's very difficult. Oh! Uh, well, is there an aux input? We tried that, but there's two different colors. But there's two different colors. The wormhole is 70 of what you call "meters" what you call "north" of what you call "here". Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I'm gonna find some fuel and take a big, fat Morty. That's my new word for shit because of today's events.  Here it is. This should take me back to my kind. I'm gonna miss you, um, Fart. I'm really sorry your name became fart.  I will be back soon, Morty.  Really? After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing. Um, cleansing? Carbonbased life is a threat to all higher life. To us, you are what you would call a disease. Wherever we discover you, we cure it. You said yourself that life must be protected, even though sacrifice. You haven't changed your mind about that. I can sense your thoughts. Morty? Um, before you go, could you sing a ccould you sing for me again? Yes, Morty.  Cosmos without hatred   Diamond stars of cosmic light   Quasars shine through endless night   And everything is one in the beauty   And now we say goodbye  Aah! Morty, why? Why? Goodbye. So, did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard? Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you. Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad that you insisted on getting that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn't for nothing, you know? You miss your fart friend, huh? Well, I got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone, I found a new wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side, and they're all coming to visit. What?! Rick, no! You can't! Too late, Morty. The hole's opening. No, Rick! You don't understand. There's there's a lot more where that came from, too. Hey, hey, bro, how many people was your Morty responsible for killing today? None. We chilled at Blips and Chitz all day. Ain't that right, homey? Darn right, bro! "Roy" rules! Must be nice. Hey, Morty, there's our Jerry. Mm! I missed you. Hey, Rick. Glad you're safe, Jerry.  What do you say we go home?  I'd like that. Hey, wait. Uh, do you have 5126? Uh, I'm not sure. Morty. Uh, that's a Blips and Chitz ticket.  What?!  Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.  Uh, wwait. What?  Uh, wwait. What? All right. Come on, Jerry.  Are you tired of the same daily droll? Well, get on over to Blips and Chitz! We got, uh, one game. We got a whole bunch of games here. You can we got chabos and flobos, and you can shoot things! Get over here! Play the games! Uh, use your flerbos to get tickets! "Roy 2" just got here. Get over here at Jitz and Chitz! It's the coolest place in the world. Uh, I get to be in the commercial!
Love   Connection   Experience  Yeah, Morty.  Come together   With love, connection, and experience   It's my favorite song.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, distress beacon! Yeah, baby! You're excited about that? The first rule of space travel, kids, is always check out distress beacons. it's a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit! Whoa! it's a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice.   Seems like something terrible happened here. Yep. Chaching. Oh, yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it. Give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship. Uh, what's that? This'll make the cops write it up as a looting by the korblocks.  That's horrible.  I hear you, man. Cops are racist. Oh, hey. You're alive. Thank god. Can you help us? Our planet was taken over by some kind of entity. It absorbed the minds of our people. We didn't notice until it was too late. The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not themselves anymore. They're part of it. Then how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two dingdongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing. Hey, no! No, wait! Stop! Called it. Hello, Rick. Long time no see. Unity?  Rick?  Grandpa? Oh, boy. Uh These are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is, uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh date.   Quite an operation you got going here, Une. You're a whole planet now, huh? After we broke up, I spent some time wandering through space.  Then I found this world  Where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification.  You mean stealing people's bodies?  Summer, rude. Why don't you two kids go run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.  Ugh.  No, wait, Rick, aren't these people gonna barf into our mouths and absorb us? You're guests here on my planet. You're free to be yourselves. I've never been any good at disappointing Rick. Well, now I'm going to barf. Come on, Morty. Jerry, what are you what are you doing in here? I'm trying to find our weed whacker, 'cause our weeds are wack, yo. But you can't go in the garage when Rick's not here.  I "can't"?  Well, he doesn't like it. What's he gonna do? Crash rentfree at his other family's house? What is that supposed to mean? Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues. He's playing you, shorty. Oh, stop affecting that stupid hiphop dialect. Stop shifting the cross hairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is to' up from the flo' up. What the hell was that? I don't know. Let's just leave. That is a hatch. Your father put a hatch in my garage. You don't know it was him. Anyway, we're not supposed to be in here. Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there. "World peace achieved." Nice. Little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So, what's next? After I become a typeone civilization, this world will be invited into the galactic federation. Oh, goody. From there, I'll have access to countless planets and species. One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the singleminded once called the God. I like that. Oh, that's pretty sexy. Hey, listen, where can we get a drink around here? Recreational substances were phased out here. There's no need for escape from the self when your world is one. Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker. Rick, when we met, I was a young hive mind with the population of a small town. People change Especially when I change them. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've grown. Hey, listen, I've grown, too. I have! See, I've I've reconnected with my family, right? Hm. Why's that, I wonder? Maybe it's part of getting old. Maybe I just missed being with a collective. Yes, Rick. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yes. Wait, wait. Stop. Hold it. Not like this. We need a hang glider and a crotchless uncle Sam costume, and I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads, and I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father. Man, look at them go. So coordinated. What's your problem? They're making you into a Mount Rushmore. They made burgers! Morty, open your eyes. There is no "they". These poor people's bodies are being used. They're a planet of puppets.  I can hear you.  Ugh. Well, it seems like everybody here's cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else. Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty? No, we don't want your dumb balloons, okay? We're bored. Take us back to Rick. Now's not a good time. Oh, yeah! I want yooooooou! Go, son, go! Go, son, go! Go, son, go! Oh, real nice. Real nice. How does a man do this without me noticing? Oh, you know my dad once he puts his mind to something. You're spinning this to his credit? I'm going down there.  Jerry  Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair, and my faceless gargler. Now, are you gonna keep hating this playa or are you gonna jack my steez? Okay, you're just making stuff up now. Ugh. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Ugh! Oh, Rick. That was so bad. What's this "was" stuff? I just need to hydrate, then we're doing that again.  Oh, damn.  Listen, if this is an invasion, I got to sit this one out, but I'll be back to have sex with the survivors. It's a neighboring hivemind species, beta seven. Our planets maintain a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources, so be nice. Unity, is it a bad time? Are all present life forms assimilated? Beta seven, this is my singleminded friend from Earth, Rick. Rick Sanchez. Unity has spoken of you. All bad, I hope. Ha ha! Bleeeeeeeeeh! Oh, Jesus Christ. Beta seven, if my allies are a problem for you, perhaps our alliance is, as well. Our alliance is beneficial. When beta seven expresses concern, it's only because Oh, snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know I can make with this stuff? Oh, Rick, I I shouldn't. Come on. It's not every day that I'm town. It's for old time's sake. Uh Okay, what the hell. We can purify the resin and make fractal dust. Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but Aw, old man Rick can't party with a whole planet? I can do whatever you do and more, baby. You know, I think beta seven over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical. Stop. Well, this explains the $6,000 electric bill. Whoa! Well, nice. Real nice. Alien prisoners under the house. Real nice. Nice. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeal God damn it, stop. Wake up, people! You have to fight it! You're under the spell of an evil monster!  I can hear you.  Yeah, so you keep saying.  Summer!  Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there! Why do you hate me, Summer? I'm not talking you. I'm talking to Steven Phillips. Steven, set yourself free. Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender. Yeah? Well, so what? At least he was himself. This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide. Now she's a marine biologist. Listen, Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she's just saying that life would be, you know, life. I have transformed life here into a paradise. Prostitutes are now scientists. The homeless are now "phisosophers". Oh. Oh. "Phphisosophers"? Nice.  Philopol phiphophopher  Oh, my god. Where did you learn to talk, you grandpastealing slut? I'm feeling Ugh. Oh, man, let me help all of you guys up. I'm fine. Do you know what I love about you, Rick? You're the only single mind I've met that really sees the big picture. You got that right. But, baby, listen yyou're talking about taking over planets and galaxies. You got to just remember to let go sometimes, you know? I can let go. Hey, look. You see that town across the river? Watch this.  Whoa!  Ha ha! Whoo! Whoa! That's not what I meant! It's okay. It's okay. I evacuated. I evacuated the town. Look. Hey! We're right here. We're fine. Oh, that was awesome. My my grandkids weren't in that town, right? Aare my grandkids alive? Mmy drink is empty.    Unity, what's happening?  Who's Unity? You kids have nice feet. Mind if I take a picture? Gross. No. I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer. Something's happening to Unity. Do all of you remember who you are? Yeah, uh, my name is Ron Benson. I'm an electrical engineer, father of two, and, as you can see from my flat, concentric nipple rings, I'm a member of this planet's top race! Okay, that's good. Uh, don't focus too much on the last part, but I'm Daryl Jefferson. I'm a landscaper. And I'll be damned if that ripplenipple bitch's race is superior! The conenipple people will rule this world! You shut your mouth, you dirty knifenipple bastards. What'd you say to me, you targetchest piece of [bleep]? Race war! Ugh! Why are you fighting?! Can't you see you're all the same? Oh, Summer. First race war, huh? Way to go, Summer. You started a race war. I didn't start it! They're the racists. I merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams. Okay, thanks for clarifying. I'll have a superaccurate headstone now. Hey, wait what race are you guys? We're neither. Ssee? Yeah, take my word for it. We just have regular nipples. Hey, these two freaks have no race!   Oh, there's no place like home. There's no place like home. Remember, Summer?  From Dorothy and the tiny people movie?  Yes, yes.  All the tiny people.  Dorothy, take us away.   Hello, Summer. Hello, Morty.  It's okay. You're safe now.  Unity?  Yes.  Oh, Unity, I am so sorry. I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks. I was thinking more of a choose your own cellphonecarrier thing. Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong. I'm having fun with your grandpa. Lost a little control. Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be running and 12 million deep fryers, but hey, it's not like this planet can take its business elsewhere. Um, should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn't have gotten drunk. Whoohoohoo! Oh, man. I cannot wait I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this. He is gone. Jerry, stop, please, okay? We weren't even supposed to be down here. If we confront him about this Oh, my god! I love this. I love that this is how far you will go for him. You want to go upstairs and cut carrots and watch a Lifetime original above a [bleep] alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic. Oh, listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person. Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing; it's a monster. He might have it chained up so that it doesn't eat the planet! Right, because your father's such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for "humans". He's probably harvesting this creature's organs. He's probably racing to cure its space AIDS.  He's going to eat it!  He's protecting it!  Shut up!  Shut up! Whoa! Unity, this place is a mess. Oh, it's cool. The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday. Oh, my god. I have a meeting at the Galactic Federation in an hour. Oh, I'll never make it. Ah, I'll push it to next week. Unity, could you get Rick out here, please? He's unavailable. He's Having sex with you. We get it. Gross. Get him out here now. I don't think he wants to be  Grandpa Rick!  Rick! Rick! I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage! What the hell is your problem? Grandpa, we need to go home, now. Fine. Sheesh. See you. Uh, Rick, I think we should allgo. Tend to your garden, kids. I'm kind of doing a thing here. Whoo! Grandpa Rick, we're not leaving without you. Oh, my god, you guys. I get it. You're afraid the big, bad hive mind is gonna steal your grandpa away. Actually, no. I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it.  What?  This isn't healthy, Rick. You know, you're really up to no good around here aat this place, you know? You and Unity are like like leggings and midcalf boots. You think you're great together, but you're just bringing out the worst in each other. Oh, gee. Boy, Summer. Well put. Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks? Unity? I'm just taking a little break from stuff. You know? I need to relax. Oh, hey, wwhat's this on the news, guys? Let me turn it up. In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is. We're really just having a good time.  Karen?  Thanks, Todd. Up next, are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill? We'll tell you how you can know for sure. I think you two are a little outnumbered. Okay, well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favor to us because you love us? What? Dumb. Bye. But Rick, Summer's just Summer's just a hyperemotional, needy little What's the word I'm looking for here? Uh Human. It runs in the family. I can tolerate it, but I can't give a crap about it. Take a hike. Take care of yourself, Unity. I'm not looking for judgment, just a yes or no can you assimilate a giraffe?  You're the worst!  No, you're the worst! You don't support this family! All you care about is yourself!  Is about supporting you emotionally  You've got two children  but you're unsupportable.  Being dragged across the cosmos  because it's never enough, Jerry!  By your dangerously ill father! And you force me to watch it happen because you'd rather lose them and lose me And you don't even know what it's like to be afraid of losing anything Than lose him!  Because you cling and you cling  Because you're the child, Beth! You, not me! You!  Aah!  Aah!  Oh, my god.  Aah! Um, first of all, hello. Uh, my name is Blim Blam the Korblok. Second of all, cards on the table, I'm a murderer that eats babies, and I came to this planet to eat babies. However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease that I suppose you could call "space AIDS" as you put it. And Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. At the same time, Rick's motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else's, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarcks. But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the [bleep] worst! You both hate yourselves and each other. And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable. I'd laugh, but I'm biologically incapable. That's how alien I am. And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you and being like, "What the [beep]"? So good luck with your shitty marriage, and tell Rick I'm sorry he has to deal with either of you. Blim Blam out. You know what? I'm taking this. How do you What is this? Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever. Okay, okay. Now make them cry, but happy crying. Now make them all make fun of the blonde one. Now make them all do it on the table. I can't believe you created a whole show for me. Now cancel it. Okay, now put it back on. All right, I'm bored. Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty?  I feel bad that they  Pbht. Screw those guys. Ugh. I'll be right back. Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful. And then because they put you there, they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right? Never. Never. Back in a flash. Best weekend ever, Rick. I agree, Rick. Let's see how long we can go. Hey, Une. You got any more Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I'm not strong enough to do it in persons. I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. And I have no problem with that, but it clearly means I have a problem with myself. I'm sure there's no perfect version of me. I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete. But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way, you're better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else's, Unity. P.S., I don't know where those coal miners were before they were assimilated. You might want to get checked. Hey. Dad. I, um Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker and found your subterranean lair and your alien prisoner, and he got away. And I know I sound like mom, but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety just because I'm afraid you'll leave again, so no more alien prisoners and no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.  Okay.  Okay? "Okay" like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere  and never come back?  No. It's your house. Grandpa Rick, what happened with Unity? Who? Oh, Unity. Yeah, well I mean, honestly, we're talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know? It's not cool. Fun's fun, but who needs it? I'll be in the garage.  Lay it, lay it down   Let me see your hand   Show me what you got   You're always talking   But you're not playing   It doesn't match your face   Get them away, away from this place   Can you take me now?   I, I want it   I want it real   Are you afraid of me now?    Are you afraid of me now?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel that I can see your soul?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel the pain in your heart?   I, I want it   I want it real   Run away with me now   I, I want it   I want it real   Run away with me now   Ah, ah     Don't leave me   Never leave me out   Don't leave me   Never leave me out  Unity! Unity! Unity! How can I assist you? I want to talk to Unity, beta seven. I know it's in there. You're classified as a hostile entity, and Unity doesn't want to talk to you. I know your game, beta seven. I've met a billion of you, you little ondeck, inthewings shoulder to cry on! You are classified as a hostile entity. Oh, you're just loving this, mother This isn't gonna shake out like you think, pal. Unity's not into other hive minds. It's gonna suck you in and use you up, and a month from now, I'm gonna be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me. Get out here. Weapons systems engaged. Oh, in your dreams you have weapon systems. Ugh, Rick, you said we were going to a movie. We are, Morty. All right, beta shit seven, you just got saved by the bell, bitch! Did you get any of that? It'sa good showa.
Steve, I just got a weird email. Did you buy us airline tickets? Aw, shoot. It was supposed to be a surprise. I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I'm treating the family to a vacation! Steve, you're so sweet.  Thanks, uncle Steve!  Best uncle ever! Look out, world. The Smith family is going to Paris! Yeah! Awesome! Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash! Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry, but life is made of little concessions. I You know what? You're gonna land on your feet, Jer. Some company out there's gonna thank their lucky stars they hired my little brother.  Who the [bleep] are you?  My goofy brother, Steve. He's been living here almost a year now. Are you losing your mind? Hey, someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks. Am I right?  Oh, my god!  Call an ambulance!  Oh, god! Steve!  What the hell, Rick?! Will everybody just relax for a second? There's no such thing as an "uncle Steve". That is an alien parasite.  But I've known him my whole life.  No, you haven't, Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories, and then they use those to multiply and spread out, take over planets. It's It's disgusting.  Steve wasn't real?  He's a real piece of shit. This is a big one. Somebody probably tracked it in last week on the bottom of their shoe on a piece of alien fruit.  Someone?  Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet. But uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike! No, "Steve" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things. So we got to keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up. Ooh, whee! Whatever you want, Rick! We're here to help! Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.   All right. There's six of us, and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer. Maybe you got the first one in time, Rick! Can't afford to chance it. Dad, why does our house have blast shields? Trust me, Beth, you don't want to know how many answers that question has. Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y remember that? After "The Hulk" musical? Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong. I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did. Why couldn't I bring my portal gun? Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the hulk. I just got that. Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose. Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine. I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be. Somebody call for repairs? Yay! Cousin Nicky! It's me, cousin Nicky. I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not. I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here! It's true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. Let's get some fresh air. Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things. I hear you, Morty. Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin' "We're walkin' here!" Nicky, get Oh! What the? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?! Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real. But how did you know it was Nicky? I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder. So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old Nazi submarine. Did that not even happen? Well, of course it happened. Now that I possess the mighty staff of rahgubaba, the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich! This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick. Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal. I'm comfortable being called a Nazi. You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings? Yeah. Think before you talk shit. Rahgubaba, help me kill America! Mr. Beauregard! After due consideration, I have elected not to retire. Yeah! Oh, thank god! Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty's high school. Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler. Dare to dream. Wait. And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble. No! Don't flashback! You're just gonna make more swelling.  Just relax.  Don't worry, Jerry. We called the fire department. You know they won't come here anymore. Marmalade is served! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, whee! I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine. Take that, Summer! We're trying to sleep. I don't want to go to the dance alone. Then perhaps you shouldn't. Aww. Mr. Beauregard.  Shall we, master Morty?  We shall. Oh, wait, don't leave without letting photography Raptor take a picture. Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house. But there's always been 10. No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites. You sure about that, Rick? Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number. All right, there's six of us. And that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, photography Raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer. Uh, dad, that's like 10 people. I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?  Here, Rick! Use me!  Oh, thanks, Pencilvester! Yeah, I guess that is what happened, but I don't get why I would do that. Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these? That's it. Photos. Hard evidence. You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole. Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine. All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school. What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're mormon or dying. I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen. Summer! Tinkles! It's past my bedtime. Not in never past bedtime land! Here we go!  Summer and Tinkles friends with each other   Living in never past bedtime land   No kitchen sinkles no little brother   Going to raves and waving our hands   Summer and tinkle, friends to the end   Group text the whole crew, my mother friends!   Ketchup to the salt, salt to the fry   "T" to the "inkle" with a capital "I"  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Summer, we're trying to sleep. It was Tinkles! Tinkles? That is su Suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character,  but we never get to  Hi, everybody. I'm Tinkles, and these are my friends. See, everyone? Tinkles is real. That means so am I.  Sorry, Summer.  Man, I'm sorry, Summer. I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one. Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the Smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend. Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off. Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. Aah!  Grandpa Rick!  Hold still, "Summer". Rick, that is my daughter. Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you. Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue? Wait, why would you want me to You're one of them, aren't you? Rick. You love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai! Remember it, Rick? Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan? Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.  You're good at it, Rick.  Watch me, baby. I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, "Cuisine" or wwhatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like Tom Cruise from "Cuisine". Yeah. Is that what it's called? "Cuisine"? Wow! Hey, everybody. Let's give it up for the grillmaster Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Wait. Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages. I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields?  Yeah.  I can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. But, Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff. You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3DS systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limitededition "Zelda" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff. Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that. Don't overreact, Rick.  Sleepy Gary, a word?  Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein He's actually Frankenstein's monster. Sleepy Gary, my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then Jerry, just say it. Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real? Jesus, Jerry. No, you're real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry. Remember our vacation? They're filming that new "Star Wars" movie down the coast.  Should we check it out?  Sure. Why not? Maybe we'll see Chewbacca. I'd like that. What are we doing? I don't give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this. Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house. That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out? Uh, no thank Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here? Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam. So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein? Shiiiit. I'mma bust a No! Get out of my head, parasite!  No!  Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein! Give it back! Yeah! Frankenstein! Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on Earth?! Maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real. You know me. I'm Reverse Giraffe. I have a short neck and legs.  I went to college with Hamurai.  Hai! I saved Ghost in a Jar's life in Vietnam.  Boo rah!  And, Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on? Too many. Okay, so maybe we're just all fake. That don't make no sense! Or maybe there's only one deceiver here The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other. Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years? Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, madeup sounding catchphrases. Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the waaaay the news goes. Hit the sack, Jack. Uhoh! Somersault jump. AIDS! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes badah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls! Yeah! Say that all the time. That's a fakeass catchphrase right there. Yeah, don't forget his incredibly vague back story. Beth, I'm your father! Oh, are you, dad? Are you? Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and And and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here! Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! In your face! Give me the gun. I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage. You listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, yyy Do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors. Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too. You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, wwe all remember you as a friend. Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!  Oh oh, yeah?  Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, mother[bleep]! Pull the [bleep] trigger! Oh, wow. Baby wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife. What the hell? I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!  These memories that we have   These memories that we cherish   I wish that we can go back to that time   Ooh, ooh, ooh  Holy crap, Morty, you're right. Isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me? Well, yeah, duhdoy. Took you long enough. Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining. We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator? II everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time? Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming. Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, Mrs. Refrigerator. They're thrilling. And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life. The jig is up! Get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah! Oh [bleep]! Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. So what about Summer? Why am I always your goto?  Never go in my room again.  I didn't! She's real. She's my bitch of a sister. Nice.  Mom, are you driving me to Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes. What time? Oh, my god. Are you drunk? What are you?  My wife coach?  Your what? Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh.  Oh! God! Mom!  Sweetheart, are you okay?  I didn't mean to  I'm gonna have a bruise!  It's picture day!  It's not don't overreact. I can clean it up. I want the police to take me! Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem. Thank you, sweetie. Beth, Beth, please! I thought it was too good to be true that we'd have compatible kidneys. Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything. Rick, I'm Pencilvester. Listen to that name. You can't kill me. You're right. Kill Pencilvester. Summer, I've always loved you! Yep.  Oh, my god!  I thought you went to a concert! We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?! I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me! You're not the victim here! I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace! Aaaaaah! Ah. Master Rick. Remember when you weren't going to shoot me? I guess I did the Butler! Ha ha! Does Does that scan? Oh, I get it. It's a play on "The Butler did it." Thanks, Ghost in a Jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy. You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary. Don't worry. I have a plan. If we can get to my boat, there's a No. No! Just send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary. Oh, god. Whoa. What the hell? Look out for that homeless guy! Open the door! Open the door! There isn't time! Just run! Get out here and help me! They say you shouldn't do that! Just run! Ugh. Sorry, Jerry. You're real. I'm a parasite! Yeah, but you're real. Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary. Me, too. From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone. This is depressing. We killed every good person in the house. We're what's left? What a family. At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Ricky ticky tavi! Ooh, whee! Amen to that. Now, this little Poopypants is hungry. Will somebody pass me a pork chop? Huh. Is is something wrong, Beth? Ow! Oh, my god!  No, Beth!  Oh [bleep]! Wait, but I  Oh, Beth! Why?!  I need an ambulance! There's been a shooting. My wife shot Uh, my my wife shot a longtime family friend. Why? Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole.  II thought  Keep breathing!  Oh, god. What's happening?  Look at me! Look at me! Don't don't fall asleep! Is is this what bleeding to death is? Oh, whee. Is this how I die? Oh, geez! Oh, my god! Why would you do this, Beth? It's not supposed to hurt. II thought Ooh, whee.  Oh, he he's looking a lot better. Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.  Is, um, is he mad at me?  He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the "you shot me" equivalent of not being mad.  Can he have visitors?  He'd like to be alone. He told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him? If you love him, you should leave. And that's the waaaay the news goes. Did you get any of that? It'sa good showa.
Hey, golf is easy now! Aah! Golf is hard again! Golf is hard again! The view from here is the same as yours, Jim. A giant head has entered earth's gravity, triggering climate change and natural disasters we thought were impossible for at least another eight years. Let's not make this political, Terry. Do we know what this giant head wants? Show me what you got. Jim, you heard the Said "Show me what you got." Show me what you got. I want to see what you got. Oh, boy. Time to go, Morty. Uh, where? The Pentagon. I mean, not the Pentagon. The lame one here on earth.  Summer: Is it God? If it's God, do we get out of school? It's not God, Summer. She's allowed to think it's God if she wants, honey.  Shut up, Jerry.  Okay. Dad, what do you know about this? Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight. Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi. I'm Morty's math teacher. I'm also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together. How is praying going to help? Ma'am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you want to play checkers? Let's be rational! I'll see you at God's house! Gentlemen, gentlemen! One at a time! Simon? SETI, NORAD, and every broadcaster on the planet are attempting to show this being what humanity's got String theory, world history, the human genome Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America's got is 70,000 megatons of kaboomboom, and I say we show it right up this floating head's ass. No, you need to let me talk! Shut up! Hold it! Don't move! Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!  Oh! Stand down! Everybody, stand down! I'm the leader of these people, and I'm unarmed. There's no need for any more snakemakery. My name is Rick Sanchez. This here is my grandson, Morty.  Hi, Morty.  Hey. I've seen enough of the galaxy to know what we've got here is a cromulon from the signus five expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math. This head won't go away until Earth shows them it's got A hit song. A hit song? We can't possibly  You mean like Vivaldi?  No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly written, catchy original song. The cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of lessevolved lifeforms. All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and TheDream. TheDream? He wrote "Umbrella" and "Single Ladies"? You people haven't heard of TheDream? You're gonna want to put them on that giant speaker system at your Sonic testing facility at Area 51. How do you know about that? For God's sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps. Sir, Pharrell, Newman, Corgan, and that Dream guy  They're all dead.  What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them? The Grammys, sir. There was an earthquake and all the musicians, all the famous ones they're gone. Dear God. Hold on, sir. Just a minute. IceT survived. He's inbound on an F15, E.T.A. two hours. Good luck, Mr. President. Sir, the magnetic poles are about to reverse. In two hours, there may not be an Earth to save. Sanchez? Are you a musician? I dabble, Mr. President. Get this man and his grandson on a black hawk to Area 51. People! Everyone! Remain calm! Every crisis of faith is an opportunity for more faith. When God deals you an 11, you don't fold! You double down! And always hit on a soft 16. That means you, Jews. I beg your pardon, pastor, but the last I looked outside, it seems to be you that's been dealt the weak hand. Jews rule! Nobody? Okay, tough church. Hi. Principal Vagina The name's real, possibly Scandinavian. I'm just gonna come out and make this pitch The old Gods are dead. [Bleep] all previous existing religions. All hail the one true God The giant head in the sky.  Children of God!  Ahtatata! Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this can beat that, what have you done for me lately? So, if you'll all excuse me, I'm going out onto the sidewalk, I'm dropping to my knees, and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the [bleep] weather. Out of my way. Okay. If sanity's been restored to this assembly, I'd like to talk about the cost of repairing our new organ. Sally, the plate, please. Oh! This is my favorite part!  Rick, are you really a musician?  Who's not a musician, Morty?  Me!  Yeah, not with that attitude. We're in the drop zone! I'm the jumpmaster! My name's Jamey With an ey! Go, go, go! Bbut But we don't have a song! Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we've done. We're sorry for our increased levels of emissions and our racism and, of course, the Amber Alerts I keep ignoring on my phone.  Whoa!  Whoa! All right, Morty. Let's get let's do it. Why don't you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat? Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. Wwe get our family and portal out of here! Morty, good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Give me a beat! Oh, man. Okay. All right, um  Oh, yeah   You gotta get schwifty   You gotta get schwifty in here   It's time to get schwifty   Uhoh  Get "schwifty"? What the hell is that? It's our world's best effort. That's what.  Take off your pants and your panties   Shit on the floor   Time to get schwifty in here   I'm Mr. Bulldops  "Mr. Bulldops"? Don't analyze it, Nathan. It's working!  Take a shit on the floor   Time to get schwifty in here  and thirdlevel donors get our allaccess family pass. Listen! The storm is stopping!  Hey, take your pants off   It's schwifty time today  Hmm. Please be kind to us, for we are but tiny things with entire bodies, stuck to your ground. I like what you got! Good job!  Yeah!  Whoo! We did it! What do you know? He was right!  Hooray Principal Vagina!  Yeah, I'll take it. Now, hold on a second! Let's be rational about this. No, I'm I'm just saying, we don't know there's a causeeffect relationship Oh, my God!  What is going on now?!  Whoa! Whoa!  What the hell happened? Mr. President, you're gonna want to see this. I think planet Earth has just been transported. The head has left and sent its children. Holy crap! Oh, dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion. It will never happen again. Oh, dear Oh, dear giant head Sir, we started picking up on a garbled signal. We're decrypting it now. We asked them to show us what they got, and they did. Now we'll see which of them has got the most. 24 hours, 5 planets, 5 songs. But in the end, there can only be one Planet music! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray. Uh, it's probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead. Welcome back to "Planet Music"! First up, let's hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops', The Greeby Bobes! Show me what you got! Hold it, hold it. Stop. Music isn't about competition or captivity. If you love music, you love freedom. Let these worlds be free! Please! Disqualified. There's one every season. Moving on to planet Arboles Mentirosos. Arbolian Mentirososians, show us what you got! A 2, 3, 4! Rick, Morty, IceT, the timetable's moved up. Earth's on in six hours. Like we're not already under enough pressure?!  Whoa! Whoa!  Yeah! Geez, Morty, the guy's just doing his job. Take it easy. Rick, IceT, could you guys take it less easy?! We've got six hours to come up with a song! Genius happens in the moment, Morty. Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them With u With us if we lose? That's planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning. Balls. Morty, Morty, stop. Listen. There's only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we're not gonna have enough charge left to get off world.  Get it?  What?!  Yeah.  You see? I try to shelter you from certain realities, Morty, because if I let you make me nervous, then we can't get schwifty. Stop saying it like it's a thing! You made it up! Hey, Morty, could you lick my Balls, balls Rick, cut it out! It's not funny, Rick! I've seen enough. These guys are onehit wonders. And what's your plan, general? We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a missile at every one of those heads in the sky. Our planet's held captive on a live game show, and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, general. Until then, I'll put mine in Rick and Morty. "Get Schwifty" was a jam. Hello? Yes, sir, yeah. Eh, thank you, sir. Thank you. He says he's proud of what we're doing and hopes we have a great ascension festival!  Happy ascension!  Happy ascension! We should pack up and leave town now. I think it's inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you'd stop being such an Evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself. Whoa! Look at you! You're wearing the hat and everything! Here's yours! Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight? Yeah, sure. Wait. What? I love you guys. You gave me life. And it's the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents. Dinner sounds nice. Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Summer, are you coming to the ascension? Father, can we please go to the ascension? Sure! Let's go to the ascension. Whwhwhat is it? We hereby send these unwantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies. Headward, free now to rise. Headward, free now to rise. Headward, free now to rise. Oh, yes! Yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free! And squeegee comes up from the garage, right? But he's got a lobster in one hand, the movie tickets in the other, he's like, "I'm ready!" You gonna take a lobster to see "Iron Man 3"? IceT! Ah, damn. We're out of originalflavor fig Newtons. I should get going anyway. Wait, wait, wait! Ccome on. Hhold on a second. Hold on.  What?!  Damn. You didn't tell me you [bleep] around with portals and shit. That's it! Whoa, whoa, Morty! Give me that. You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down! Morty, just put it down. You don't know what you're doing. I'm going to go find mom and dad! No! Oh [bleep]! Oh [bleep].  Oh [bleep]. And then Ethan played guitar, and we learned the seven contemplations of the head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head! Praise be the Yeah. Hi, folks. Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. It's 6:00 P.M., so if you're a parent, you're now entitled to adoration from your children. I'm going to start dinner! I don't know what to say. Summer is doing really well here. She's aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become. She's not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew. Please help me. You can reach me if you try. Please help me! That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving. Taco time! I hope it pleases you as the head desires. That's wonderful, Summer. We're so proud of you. But obviously you don't have to make dinner every night. Of course I do, silly! Oh, my God, daddy! I'm sorry I called you silly! I'm so sorry! Heavenly heads and cranial creator, forgive my transgressions against family and community. May my chores complete me as I complete them.   Morty.  Birdperson? You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this but can promise nothing. Whwhat do you think, ice? Probably a little overdeveloped. Shit, overdeveloped, underdeveloped A bad song's a bad song. Well, do you think, maybe Could you give me some help with it, or? Aw, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I can't afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what I'm saying? Ice, I don't want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but if Morty doesn't come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it's, uh, you know, kind of your problem, too. Pfft! I ain't worried about no earth blowing up, man. What? Why not? Yo, this is why. What the [bleep] you can turn into ice? My story begins at the dawn of time in the faraway realm of alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of my many stops on a lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don't care if it blows up, because I'll just be ice floating through space, like a comet. Take it from me, ice, you can't just float around space not caring about stuff forever. Pfft. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick. Okay, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to get schwifty. Oh, for God's sakes. That's enough. What the hell are you doing, Nathan?! I'm the goddamn president of the United [bleep] States! I'm setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into earth's performance. And you, Mr. President I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun. Wait, wait, wait. Why why I believe I can access the history of Rick's gun and help you get back to him. But can you help me get to my family? You know, at at my house? Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move. All of Rick's moves are dick moves! What What am I eating? Whwhat is this, bird birdseed? It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don't know what humans eat.  You know what this human eats.  Don't be gross, Tammy. Bird [bleep]. Tammy, gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn't care about anyone but himself. He doesn't think about the consequences of anything he does. And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other And the reason I'm alive at all.  What's that? Who's that baby? Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick? That was Chunkytunk with "Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorbdork." Up next, planet Earth! Oh, God! We're up?! Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what headism has to offer the world.  The world?  Headism is a hit. We're taking it worldwide, and we'd like Jerry to be our church's head of advertising. You would? Beth, we'd like to promote you from horse surgeon straight past human surgeon to head of medicine. That's my dream! That's my dream. Thank you. This is all so overwhelming. But, uh  We can't.  Absolutely not. I'm sorry? We've been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be our daughter, not this person she's become. We'll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs, outside of a potatobased religion. And you know what? II'm sick of pretending that we're together because of the kids in the first place. I married you because you're the love of my life. And I'm lucky to have you, and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family. Please don't do this! Please don't do this!  Summer!  Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip, and I have it in my cheek, but I don't know what to do with it, and it hurts. You're going to be okay. You will come back as babies. I am a baby! I'm a baby now! Hello? Is anybody here? Mr. President! This is bluebird! Code tango niner Alpha! Abort launch! Abort! Hello? He's blocked me out. Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty! It won't matter how schwifty you get, Morty. The general's got nukes set to launch halfway through earth's song! Oh, my God! Uh, ccan you fly a black hawk? Can the pope's [bleep] fit through a doughnut? Uh, I'm Not sure. Exactly. Show me what you got! Uh  Lapoo lapoo lapoo dops   Napoo napoo napoo nots  Headward, free now to rise. Hey, look at the heads! Looks like the heads are getting angry! I'm really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons in this thing! Mr. President, if I've learned one thing today it's that sometimes you have to not give a [bleep]!  Napoo napoo nots  Ugh. Tough crowd. I'm sure that has That has nothing to do with this. The heads are displeased! Summer! Um Morty! Hooray! Hooray! Look! Hooray! The heads love this! They love it when we don't kill the Smith family! No! Stop that! You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads! Call off the nuclear strike! This is the president! Stop the nuclear missile launch! Just launch the missiles! Boo! Not cool! I'm the only one that speaks to the heads! Disqualified! The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him! Disqualified! Disqualified!  IceT?! That's right. It's me IceT. I care now. You made me care more. With all due respect, I'd like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play. What do you say, Rick? I say, let's do it! Hooray! Yeah. All right.   Oh, yeah   Uhhuh. Here we go.  Oh, yeah   Say it with me   Head bent over   Raised up posterior   Oh, yeah   Head bent over   Yeah, raised up posterior  Sing it with me now! Oh, my go  Head bent over  Yeah.  Raised up posterior  All right!  Head bent over  Oh, yeah. Raised up posterior! After 988 seasons of "Planet Music", the cromulons have decided to declare earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye.  Yeah!  We did it! Yes! Let's get a music album now! Did he just say "musical reality show"? Yeah, it's possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren't actually related at all. Help! We should go get him. I hope I can call on you and Rick again if I need you, Morty. Sure thing. And I I was kind of hoping that I could get a selfie with you? Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we'll deny it and probably worse. Understood. Diiiiie! Oh, no, no, no! Why didn't he turn into a snake? Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch, snake holster on the leg. I love this man!  MagnesiumJ, HydrogenF Father. Word of your selfless acts on the Earth planet have traveled across the galaxy. I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on alphabetrium. Very well. Your exile ends today. Welcome home, WaterT. The numbericons! They're attacking! Battle stations! Aah! Father! I love you, son. I should have never turned you to ice. WaterT, where are you going?! There's too many of them! Then I better crunch the numbers. Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a "Ball Fondlers" movie franchise. I can't believe the things this reality considers PG13.  Yeah. II'm pretty jealous.  Don't be, Morty. There's pros and cons to every alternate timeline fun facts about this one It's got giant, telepathic spiders, 11 9/11s, and the best ice cream in the multiverse!  Shut up!  We go get some ice cream, mother[bleep]! Oh, great. Oh, boy. Wwhat's wrong, Rick? Is it the quantum carburetor or something? "Quantum carburetor"? Jesus, Morty. You can't just add a SciFi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery.  We're gonna have to go inside.  Um, go inside what? The battery, Morty. Be right back, Summer. Stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel spidery. Wait! You can't leave me here! You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe. Keep Summer safe. Ohh! Ugh. Wonderful. Hey, excuse me. Hello. Um What, you think you're better than me?! Nobody's better than me! Hey! Hey! Aah! Aaaaah!  Keep Summer safe.  Aaaaaaah! Hey, man, what the hell?! That was my daughter's pediatrician! Aah! No, stop! Don't kill him! Confirmed. Aah! Oh, God. I can't feel my legs. Help! Help!!  Summer is safe.  I don't feel safe. Confirmed. No. Oh, God, help me. Help me! Help me, please! You can help me!  Oh, man. Where are we, Rick? Morty, remember eight seconds ago when when you said, "Go inside what?" And I said, "The battery"? And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, "Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty.  What a perplexing mystery this is."  All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it.  You don't have to bust my balls.  Huh, this isn't right. This pipe's supposed to be sending up to the engine, Morty. Instead we've got zero? Now what are these people doing? Wwwwhoa, people? It's time for some handson engine repair.  All right, Morty, hold on to something.  Whoa! Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. Ttthis is like a whole pplanet or something. Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out. I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery. It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. That just sounds like slavery with extra steps. Oohlala, someone's gonna get laid in college. It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out. You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Thththey're setting up chafing dishes. Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae.  These people need to think we're aliens.  What? Why? Obviously you really know nothing about car repair. Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down. Greetings! Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means "Peace among worlds." How hilarious is that? Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here. Rick, our alien friend. Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power. That's correct. We've evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete. I would love to see it. [Bleep] you. What did you say to me?! "[Bleep] you." Yyou told me it means "much obliged". Oh. Right. Uh, bblow me. No, no, no. Blow me. Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars. I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it's your ass. Chris, I'm in the middle of something. Zeep, is Rick The alien. Rick the alien. Rick the alien Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school. I dropped out of school. It's not a place for smart people. Ohhhh, snap! Listen to me, you arrogant little RRick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep. Fine. It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse. Dumb name.  Excuse me?  Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside? This isn't a [bleep] chocolate factory. I don't have time. Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world? Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let's go. Whoaoh! Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank. What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes. I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical.  It's not cool.  What?! Yyyou got the people on this world slaving away making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery. No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps. Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college. Rick, a word? What the hell was that? I know. "Eek barba dirkle"? That's a pretty [bleep] up "oohlala". No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here? Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that mother[bleep] ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. Whwhwhy are you making that face? Holy [bleep]! It's me. I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world. You don't think that's overdoing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of Never mind. You know what? I shouldn't be so critical. I'm an alien. Places, please. We're about to land. Too fast. Law enforcement converging on location. Keep Summer safe. No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody! Confirm custom defense protocol Keep Summer safe No physical force.  Yes.  Processing. Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air! Scanning assailants. Psychological option detected. Gestating. "Gestating"? Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire!  Incoming!  We got a device! Bomb! Bomb! Daddy? Oh, my God.  Hunter?  Daddy? What the hell? Jesus Christ, cease fire! Stay back! Hhhunter?  Daddy.  Hunter! Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter. Oh, my boy. My boy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault.  I'm sorry.  Daddy, leave the car alone. Wwwwhat? Leave the car alone. Hunter? Don't Oh, my God. Stay here, Hunter! No! God, no! Hunter! All of you have loved ones. All can be returned. All can be taken away. Please step away from the vehicle. Keep Summer safe. And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements.  Hey, uh, let me ask you something.  Yes? Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new? All of them. That's their job. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energywise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box? How do you know about that? It's top secret. So remember a crank a day is not nearly enough. Crank it. I told them this means "Peace among worlds".  How hilarious is that?  Rereally funny, Zeep. Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you. It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulleybased device I call a blooble yank. But what they won't know is You'll be taking most of their energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. It's showtime. You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong. You're basically This is slavery. You're talking about creating a planet of slaves.  Told you, Zeep.  Oh, they won't be slaves. They'll work for each other and pay each other money. That just sounds like slavery with ex tra steps.  What?  Wait a minute. Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse?  Microverse!  Uh, teenyverse. Ugh! You bastard! Much obliged.  What the hell is happening?  This is healthy, trust me. You're my battery, mother[bleep]. That's all you are. I made you. Your microverse sucks! And your miniverse is the size of a [bleep] lobster tank! It's whack! Are they not really aliens? Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know? So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe. And that guy made a universe. And that's the universe where I was born. Where my father died. Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe.  I made you!  Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing. You know, one time, Rick sh accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, oldlady science, you know? She's a real You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she she'll She bucks pretty hard. Ooh, boy, what Oh, my God, no!  Teenyverse.  Teenyverse. Come on, come on, come on. Pterodactyl! Asshole! When I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it. Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what? Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we We need it to start our car. That's what you used my universe for? To run your car? Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you [bleep] [bleep]sucker! What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality! You crafty son of a Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on! Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries! I didn't ask to be born! All right, that's it! I'm out. II'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people.  It can't be worse than this.  Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you. That's a myth! Wwwhy are you trying to start a myth? It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights! Go, go, go! Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now? I am unable to destroy this army. To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army,  but you will not permit it.  Correct. You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures. If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that. Confirmed. I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters. But I do want to say you are not making this easy. You know you're kind of a dick, right? My function is to keep Summer safe, not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe and stuff. That's you. That's how you talk. Hey, that's my deer! Aaaaaaah! Raah! I hope your God is as big a dick as you. My God's the biggest dick that's never existed. Why do you think I'm even here? You're here because you created someone smarter than you. Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots. Kalo kada sha la. Holy shit. Morty? I haven't seen you in months. You're leading the tree people? Huh. That's a step up. We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest. Ooh. Wow.  Gaaaaay.  That is pretty gay. You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you. This is ku'ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the You have to get us the [bleep] out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m I miss my family. I miss my laptop. I masturbated to an extracurvy piece of driftwood the other day! Look, I don't care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bull[bleep], and you're working together to get us back home. No can do, Morty. I just can't. I just don't see how I can Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart. You'll figure it out. You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship! All right, not bad. I guess you're an okay proto recombinator. I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination. If this works, drinks are on me. If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower. I'm an alcoholic. Opium addict. All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up. You guys are the [bleep] worst! Your gods are a lie! [Bleep] you, [bleep] nature, and [bleep] trees! Yes! You did it! Yes! Hey, uh, how about that drink? Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship. Isour wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with? It's cool. I'll be back in a sec. You know how long a second can take in a microverse? Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic!  Morty, hop on my back.  Why? Go, go Sanchez ski shoes. Aaaaaah! Eight Aaaah! Oof! Hold still. Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast. Aaaah! Holy  You monster!  Whoa. Bad tour. seven Hey, you got to sign out. Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie! If that were really true, then  I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.  Third floor. Would you like to go to dinner with Uh, no. You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it. [Bleep] What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us! Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car. What?! A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car.  Oh, my God!  Concentrate, Morty. Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty. Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine. six  Hey, Zeep.  Huh? Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch. Aaah! We did it, Morty. Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe. Excuse me? five Sir?  Holy hell.  Sir! Hold you fire! What's going on? I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government. Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human and spiderkind will live side by side in peace. We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption. Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs. What do we do about the space car? Leave it alone. I mean, what did it really do, anyways? Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy? Not a bad trade for spider peace. All right, that's it. Move out! I love this spider! Summer is safe. All right, I get it. Rick! Don't do it. You quit school, but you still got some learning to do. Aah! Unh! Class dismissed. Geez.  You all right?  Uhhuh! What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead. Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see. Hey, wait huh? I don't get it. Of course you don't. But Zeep did. He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken. Peace among worlds, Rick. Jesus. Yeah. Listen to that baby purr. You were right, Morty We really just needed to be honest with those guys. All right, here we go. Thank yooou. See, Morty? This is what it's all about. This is why we do what we do.  Uhhuh.  Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream. Presidential decree All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.  What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?!  It was your ship!  Your stupid ship did it!  Don't blame my ship!  It melted a child!  My ship doesn't do anything  It killed it itself!  unless it's told to do something!  We almost died!  I don't want to hear it, Summer! Your boobs are all hanging about, and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out. And don't even try to deny it, either. Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
What's new at school?  Nothing. Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died. They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her. Good lord! Who does something like that? Obviously a vampire. Wwwhere's the pepper? Wait, what?! Vampires are real?! Yes, Summer, vampires are real. Who knew? Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now. Yeah, Summer, it's a big universe. Get used to it. Rright, Rick? Well, what are we going to do?! We're gonna live our lives until we die. Possibly by vampire. More likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire. Grandpa Rick, couldn't you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down? Um wow. Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer. I probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zitcovered, hormoneaddled, lowstakes assworld that is high school. But here's my reverseask Why in the [Bleep] would I ever do that, ever? And how dare you even ask me that? And why aren't you more ashamed of yourself? Dad! Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie. Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter? Sorry! I wasn't paying attention. To a conversation about vampires?! Clearly, I didn't know it was about vampires, because I wasn't paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me! Oh, here we go, right to the victim role. Am I a victim, Beth, or am I married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?! Jesus Christ! Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already? Well, we tried a couples' therapist. That's earth therapy. You might as well ask a horse to fix a merrygoround. I mean, he'll try his best, but mostly, he's just gonna get horrified. I know about a place offplanet with a 100% success rate. Well, we want to make it work, if we can. It's just  then it's settled. No need to pack.  Oh! Let's go, go, go, go! Do you think mom and dad are, you know, gonna get a divorce? I think it's okay to dream, Morty. I'm gonna go make some wooden stakes. I booked you for a twoday intensive at nuptia four, the galaxy's most successful couples' counseling institute. They could save the marriage of a dog and a bar of dark chocolate. They could save the marriage of a porn star and a porn star. Well, I know I'm ready to try whatever it takes. Which clearly implies that I'm not. It's not a competition, Beth. Oh is that how you're gonna try to win, by implying I'm competitive? If the shoe fits. My shoe fits up your ass. You wish! Okay, have fun. See ya Thursday! Oh! Jerk. Don't insult my father. He's the reason our kids are only halfstupid. Ha! You just called yourself Oh. Beth and Jerry Smith? Yes. I'm glaxo slimslom. Welcome to nuptia four. Your marriage can rest easy now. Jerry, go ahead and sit there and put this on. This machine isolates the part of the subject's brain containing all perceptions of its romantic partner. And we will now render Jerry's perception of Beth with artificial biological life. Interesting. What the hell is that?! Take that back! You do not think that about me! I didn't do anything! They scanned it out of my brain. Can I take it back? There's nothing to regret. We're dealing with unconscious, unhealthy thoughts. Beth. Now, we scan for Beth's perceptions of Jerry. Scan hard. He's dead to me. Everything's dead to you. What? Nothing. Read it and weep, bitch. Does everybody see what I mean? I think we all see what you both mean. Any leads on the vampire? No, Summer! I mean, you know, I think it might be time that we just llet it go. Oh, so, now, you're too cool for this, just because grandpa Rick is? It's not that, it's just that the universe is a little too big to care about something so small. Aah! What up, my Helsings? Who wants to hunt a vampire? Ha ha ha! Rick? How how did you Yeah, I got bored and then, I remembered, this morning, how I blew Summer off, and I thought, "hey, why are you such a grumpy douche, Rick? Go to the garage, transfer your mind into a younger clone of yourself, and get embroiled in some youthful hijinks, what's the bfd?" So here I am. I'm tiny Rick! Oookay. Well, it's good you're here, Rick. I was pretty sure we didn't have what it takes to deal with a bloodsucker on our own. Don't shortsell yourself, Summer. You got everything it takes. But it'll still be fun to do this as a [Bleep] team, mother[Bleep] tiny Rick! Yeah! Oh, my God, Toby Matthews! Hey, Toby. I'm tiny Rick. I'm new. Hey oh go easy on me. Ha ha. Just kiddin'. I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool. Summer. He knows my name! Why wouldn't he? You're great! But, listen, just be careful. We can't rule anybody out as the vampire, not even the dreamboats. Stop, tiny Rick. Huntin' a vampire with my grandkids! [Bleep]! Tiny RiIck! The next step is to watch your mythologues interact together and, uh big surprise It's never pretty. Here we have garrrh and zharbidar gloompfschs, or, should I say, here we have the way garrrh and zharbidar perceive each other. As we can all see, this is hardly the real garrrh and zharbidar. Which is good, because the relationship in their heads is not only ugly, it's unsustainable. You may already be learning something important All of these relationships are different, none of them are real, and none of them work. We are not the monsters we sometimes see each other as, because we are real and we are functional. That's what makes us better than them. We can find solutions. We can adapt. We can communicate. And, most importantly, we can work together. Well, it was a tough adventure, but it paid off Our school is vampirefree! Man, who would've suspected coach feratu? You did great, guys. Couldn't have done it without ya. You know, we wwe should be proud of ourselves. We killed a vampire and a gym teacher. Ha ha ha. Talk about twoforone, right?! So, how, exactly, is your old body living in there, grandpa Rick? Oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid, That kind of thing. It preserves living tissue. Not that there was much to preserve. Look at that mummy! Ha! Ha ha! And I guess it's time for me to get back inside the oldtimer. Oh, my God. Toby Matthews is asking if my parents are still out of town and if we can have a party! All right, way to go, Summer! What did I tell you? Ohh! He's asking if tiny Rick will be here. Well, you know what, Summer? Tell him tiny Rick will be here! And tell him to bring some brews! For real? Yyyyou would stay as tiny Rick, just so we can have a party? Hell, yeah! What's one more night? And who can have fun with this old bastard hanging around, huh? Wubby lubby doob doob! Whoo!  Tiny Rick! Moving on. Now, we have Beth and Jerry Smith from the planet earth. My heart is pounding. This is gonna be great. The earth relationships are simpler. It's a primitive planet, so their dysfunctions are oh Wwait, what? What's going on? Where are the Smith mythologues? Oh, my God. Aah! Aah! Oh, my God. Secure the cell! Aaaah! Uh, hey! You know what's fun? Our gift shop. Why don't we proceed in an orderly Oh, dear God, no. They're codependent! Run! Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah, you really know how to sport that color blue. Really? You're looking real good. Oh, my God. Hey, Morty. Oh, hey hey, Jessica. So, is tiny Rick your brother or cousin, or? No, my grandpa just transferred his consciousness into a clone of himself so he could be in our high school. Cool. Hey, tiny Rick's playing guitar. All right, everybody. This next one's coming straight from the heart. Making the lyrics up right off the top of my head.  Let me out  what you see is not the same person as me   My life's a lie  I'm not who you're looking at   Let me out, set me free  I'm really old; This isn't me   My real body's slowly dyin' in a vat   Is anybody listening'  can anyone understand?  Stop lookin' at me like that and actually help me   Help me!  Help me; I'm gonna die! Tiny Rick! Thanks, everybody! This guy's amazing! I love tiny Rick! Bad. Ass.  Yeah! Aah! Huh? What the [Bleep]? Yeah, I know! What kind of operation are you running? Us?! What the hell kind of relationship do you have?! Oh, right, blame this on us. Okay, uh, I can and I am! Your demonized mythologizations of each other are cooperating. Isn't that good? No. No! It's bad! You have the single worst marriage I've ever witnessed. It shouldn't exist! You should never, ever, ever, have gotten together and I do not understand how, or why, you would ever stay together. Aaah! Well, this is just bad couples' therapy. Totally. Wait for us! There's only room for one more. I'm a therapist. I'll talk to them. They're not therapists. Go, go, go! There's gotta be a way to contact my dad. Let's find a control room or something. Beth! You'll want to see this. What is it? It's a small, hinged panel with a tiny amount of space behind it. If you can find one, too, we should be safe for hours, maybe days! You stay put, Jerry. I'll send help, if I make it. You don't want to find your own little hatch? Jerry, I believe that, if you hide by yourself, you might survive and I believe I, by myself, have a shot of getting out of here, but the two of us, together? I don't know. Look, maybe the shrink was right. Good luck. All right, now, you listen to me. Oh! Or don't. Hey! Don't! Please! Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God! Now, I know I've said, in the past, that math is important And it is! But I also think that, one day, you'll all look back on being in high school with tiny Rick and Morty, who I hear had a great party last night. So, class dismissed. You've got the day off! All right! Good work, Mr. goldenfold! Yeah, get outside. Read a book. Put on some sunscreen, Danielle! Hey, what's up, Summer? Ooh, nice top. Thanks. Tiny Rick, you think you might be getting back into your old body tonight? No can do. Tonight's the big dance and Morty's bringing Jessica. He needs his tiny wing man. Tiny Rick! Okay, but if not tonight, when? I don't know. When I feel like it? Damn, girl! You need to chill out! This whole thing was your idea, in the first place, and, now, you're trying to rush it along. Yeah, and you know what? I like high school. I like hanging out. Tiny Rick! But what if the you that likes it isn't you? Oh! Oh, Summer! It's just Rick in a younger body. What's the what's What's what's What's the What's the problem? Look at his art, Morty. I've got an emo streak. It's part of what makes me so rad. Why does it say "help me Morty and Summer!"? Come on, Summer, that's the title of the art. Why was knight rider called knight rider? The car's name was kitt. Nobody rode Michael knight. You're overthinking it, Summer. I'm tiny Rick! Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind into this body's young brain, it did what young brains do It shoved the bad thoughts into the back and put a wall around them. But those bad thoughts are the real Rick. The fact that you're old, the fact that we're all going to die, one day, the fact that the universe is so big, nothing in it matters, those facts are who you are. So you're trapped in there and you can only come out in the form of tiny Rick's teen angst! Well, Summer, I hear Toby Matthews isn't into psycho chicks. Can't think of anyone that is. I'll see you mother[Bleep] at the dance! Tiny Rick! Morty, you have to help me! Summer, he's happy! I'm happy! IIis that why you're doing this, you don't want me and Rick to be happy? No. Well, then get your shit together! Get it all together and put it in a backpack. All your shit, so it's together. And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know? Take it to the shit store and sell it oor put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do! You just gotta get it together. Get your shit together. Get back! Wait, for real? You're how Beth sees me? Oh, my God. Turn around! I said turn around! How can Beth have these thoughts about me?! That judgmental monster bitch! I'm not taking this. I want to know where my wife is. You are going to help me. No! Nobody's doing that! Stay. What do you want? Jerrys. You want Jerry? I don't even want Jerry. I want Jerrys. Waahee! An army. An army of Jerrys. The value of his subservience is wasted on you. I will use it to dominate the universe. Ah ha ha. Boy, Jerry must think I'm pretty stupid, for you to be this stupid. Wouldn't it make more sense to put my dumbass husband in this chair, so you can make an army of youbadass self? There could never be more than one of me. I'm the strongest, smartest being alive because Jerry thinks you're that much stronger and smarter than you are! Okay, ouch.  Oh, hey hheyy! Morty, Jessica, what's up? Check out the new dance I made up. It's called "ooh let me out!"  Let me out  let me out  this is not a dance  I'm beggin' for help  I'm screamin' for help  please come let me out  let me out  let me out  this is not a dance  I'm beggin' for help  I'm screamin' for help  please come let me out  I'm dyin' in a vat  in the garaage  Awesome! Okay, that last part was really weird. Maybe Summer's on to something here. I don't know. It was fun. You want to slow dance? Tiny Rick, hey, great dancing as usual. Moment of your time? Tiny Rick, this conversation is gonna break my heart wide open. You're a great student and the fact that you're an 80yearold man in a clone body, it never bothered me. But this here is another matter. You recognize this? We got a tip it was in your locker. Yeah, now, because the gym coach was a vampire, the school board is embarrassed and won't take it public, however, they can't have students killin' teachers. I gotta expel you for this one, tr. I'm sorry. I just got expelled, Summer! Oh! So I guess there's no need to stay young. My top! Screw your top! You ratted on me?! I'm tiny Rick! Fine! Yes! Because I love you and I'm trying to save your life! High school is my life! Summer Smith is a [Bleep] psycho nerd and she just got me kicked out of school! Boo! Summer, I thought you were cool! I'm sorry, okay? How can you be such a bitch? Oh, my God, Morty. Your sister crossed tiny Rick? Talk about selfdestructive. Yeah. Hey, Jerrylover! How about a taste of the real thing? Jerry! Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah ah ah ah ah aah aah. Not on my watch. That's it! Beth, it's me, your husband! I'm here to save you. Or my name isn't Jerry Smith! Aha!  Yes! Jerry Smith! Yeah, here.  Aha! Okay, fair enough. Say goodnight, old man. What the hell are you doing?!  Put it down! Summer, you bitch! Don't talk to her that way! She's your granddaughter! I don't need a granddaughter! I'm tiny riIck! She's my sister! And if tiny Rick is gonna be an asshole to my sister, then, you know, yyyou may as well be old again. You think you're tough, huh, Morty? What are you gonna do? I'm tiny Rick. I'm the coolest kid in your school. How are you gonna just make me do whatever you say, huh? I'm gonna do what real Rick would do if he was here I'm gonna kick your ass! Ohhhh! Rick, I know you're in there! I know you're trying to get out! That's it, Morty! Hold him down!  Drink up, baby  stay up all night listen to it, tiny Rick. Listen to elliott Smith. Ugh! No! Feel what he's feeling. Ugh! Noooooooo! God!  That you'll never see oh, God, what is life? How can someone so talented die so young? What is being young? I'm not young. I'm old. I'm I'm gonna die. My body isn't real. Morty! Summer! It's me! It's Rick! Regular Rick! Rick! How do we get you back into your body? Okay, listen carefully. There's a set of diodes on the vat's control panel, a blue one and a red one. Oh, God, what kind of world is this? I didn't ask to be born. I need you to connect the blue one to my left temple and the red one to Why doesn't anyone really like me? Focus, grandpa! Just put the stupid wires on my head! I hate being a teenager! Ugh! Arrgghh! Ah! Uhhhhh! Jerry, you can't bend metal. Then make a me that can! How can I do that while I'm watching you totally fail to bend metal? Good old Beth! The mind of a robot and the heart of an insect! Don't talk that way about her. What? Oh, it hurts! Oh, God. Stop. This representation displeases me. Aaah! Good lord. How did you? Well, I had a feeling that, in your mind, the ideal version of me is one smart enough to see you as A goddess. Not such a stupid worm now, are you? Honey, when it comes to the subject of your ego, I'm Stephen [Bleep] hawkinson. Ugh, it's Never mind. I love you. Ugh agh. Rick! Pants! Holy shit! Thanks, kids. You figured it out. Well, Summer did. Kind of weird that you were that willing to sell my existence out for some trim, Morty. What?! Pants! But listen I forgive you both because you know what? I learned, today, something important The teenage mind is its own worst enemy. Oh, I also learned this Operation Phoenix is not the fallback I thought it would be. I guess it's back to the drawing board. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Put some pants on! Put pants on. Grandpa's back, baby! Grandpa's Oh, man, I gotta pick up your parents. They have been blowin' me up. One last swing for the road! Aaaaaaaaaaah! For the love of God, get dressed! So, what do you think? You wanna keep this marriage going a while longer? At least until Morty has graduated high school. Oh. Mm. Aha, you see? What did I tell you two? It worked. You know what, Rick? I guess, in a way Already lost interest. Get in the car. I've been inside a kid all day and, now, I can feel my bones scraping each other. Uh, just so you're prepared, there's a bunch of dead mes in the garage. Huh! Sounds like our stories were connected by a theme. Not really, Jerry. Probably a cosmetic connection your mind mistakes for thematic. Oh. Old Rick! Ruinin' everything!  Master. Speak. Coach feratu's presence was discovered by the humans. He has been destroyed. No bother. The mortals shall soon I'm sorry, what did you say his name was? Coach feratu. Coach feratu. That was his real name, like his actual vampire name? No no no no. His vampire name was balik alistane. Why the [Bleep] would he name himself after a famous vampire movie? Was he doing a bit? I do not know, your unholiness. Jesus [Bleep] Christ. From now on, no more of this clevername bullshit. When a vampire is pretending to be a human, they can just call themselves Alan Jefferson or something like that. It's crazy, right? I mean, am I being an asshole? Okay, I feel like everybody in the room is looking at me like I'm the buzzkill. I'm not? Good. Okay. Great. Oh, my g! Did you get any of that? It'sa gooda show!
[Door Beep] Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine. You hear me, Jerry? You're gonna be fine. Whoa! Ooh, watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send you into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes and mouth. Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of cherry Garcia? I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically, the second freezer drawer is mine.  Not anymore.  You're overreacting! We're losing him. All right, fine, but you're not touching my crisper.  Is he going to die?  Don't worry. Dr. glip glop is the best in the galaxy. Hello, I'm Dr. glip glop. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  [ Roars ]  Aah! [ Sizzling ] What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the ga[Belches]laxy. It's like those Pizza places that claim to have the best Pizza in the world. What do you think, they have Pizza contests? Have you ever been to a Pizza contest?  Go in the waiting room, dad.  Fine! Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for? Just kidding. I don't care.  Well, this won't do.  Hey, what are you doing?  A sequel.  I don't understand.  Yeah, me, neither. We pretty much nailed it the first time. [ Rapping indistinctly] Man: Biatch! [ Electricity crackling ] Ooh! Ooh! Ow! "Man vs. Car," the newest hit show,  where it pits a man  Yeah! Versus a car. [ Horn honks ] On tonight's episode, Michael Jenkins fights a regular old car. Here we go. Oh, he's pushing his way through. He's trying to fight that car, but the car seems to have the upper hand. Oh, he's got a little bit of pushback there. Oh, no. He just got ran over and chewed up by the tires. I guess that's another one for the cars. [ Laughs ] I mean, wouldn't the cars always win?  Samantha, I need to know, that you understand that I have a couple of eyeholes. I do. I do understand about your eyeholes. Here, look at my eyeholes. Oh, my God. You have eight eye ho holes. [ Chuckles ] Ohh, I'm looking through your eyeholes. Yes, look through my eyeholes. [ Moaning ] I'm the eyehole Man. I'm the only one that's allowed to have eye holes. Get up on out of here with my eyeholes. Announcer: Eyeholes. Get them today. Ikea Rick: You got to be careful, Morty. If that guy catches you with a box of his eyeholes, he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit out of you. But it's worth the risk. They melt in your mouth, Morty. They're delicious. Dad, I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal.  We're worried about Jerry.  Well, you're 39 years too late, or, you know, however old he is. Is he is he 50? Jesus Christ, Beth, is is Jerry 50? Where am I? Relax, Mr. Smith. You're in an alien hospital. I mean, to you, it's an alien hospital. To me, you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you. Okay. An hour ago, shrimply pibbles, the galaxy's most influential civil rights leader, was brought to this hospital's emergency room, where he is currently fighting for his life. My God. Mr. Smith, shrimply pibbles' life can be saved if we replace his heart with your human penis. I see. Wait, what? It's perfect. The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call your balls, and with relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a functioning heart for the most important man in the universe.  Yeah, but I mean  Oh, forget it! I told you this was a waste of time! Have respect, yarp. The earth man's world is tiny and undeveloped. He knows nothing of the genocides of clorgon or the tragic events of 65.3432.23/14. And even if he did, he wouldn't comprehend them. I've dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It's funny to say they are small. It's funny to say they are big. I've been at parties where humans have held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves and called out, "hey, look at me. I'm Mr. soandsodick. I've got suchandsuch for a penis." I never saw it fail to get a laugh. All right! That's enough! You guys are talking about my species. We understand genocide. We do it sometimes. Then you would give your penis so that shrimply pibbles might live? Stop asking! Yes, I will! That's right, assholes. Take my penis. Take it all! And tell shrimply pibbles that when the galaxy came calling, Jerry Smith from earth didn't flinch! [ Laughs ] Hey, wwhat's wrong, Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh? Huh? Oh, no, no, no. I'm just I'm just looking at that lady over there getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she human, or is she like worf? You know, worf from "Star Trek," how he has all that shit all over his face, but he's just a human in a costume, you know? Morty, uh, let's see what else is on, huh? Okay. And now we're back to "how did I get here?" The only show that makes you ask yourself, "how did I get here?" [ Chuckles ] Here's our first person. Oh. Oh, my God. How did I get here? Hello?! How did I get here?! Somebody, help me, please! Host: [ Laughs ] All right! Holy crap! Look, it's that lady with the shit on her face like worf from "Star Trek" that was getting coffee! How did she get there?! Oh, my God, Morty, how did she get there? How did she get there? [ Laughs ] Is that something we should be concerned about? Just stay away from the coffee machine. Man: Calling all jan Michael Vincents. Calling all jan Michael Vincents. Announcer: In a world where there's eight jan Michael Vincents Man: We need one jan Michael Vincent to quadrant "c." We need two jan Michael Vincents to quadrant "e." and 16 quadrants, there's only enough time for a jan Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be at two quadrants at once. Hey, Rick, who who is jan Michael Vincent? Oh, man. I'm trying to remember, Morty. Jan Michael Vincents are used up. I need a goddamn jan Michael Vincent. Is it important that we know who jan Michael Vincent was  in order to get this?  Nope. II refuse to send the legislation that allows more than eight jan Michael Vincents to a precinct. This january, it's time to Michael down your Vincents. "Jan quadrant Vincent 16."  Whoa!  Whoa! That's jan Michaels. Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature because I think I have jan quadrant Vincent fever over here. All right, Morty! You've done it. So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here, here, and here. Got it. Leaving a partial length of severed urethra  to be threaded through  [ Laughs ] Oh, you know what, I got to I got to laugh at myself here. I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife. Oh. Do you think she'll be okay with this? Oh, absolutely. Beth's automatically on board always with every decision I make. Hey, I'm stealy. Follow me on my adventure through this office.  All right, here we go. We're gonna just steal a couple of things. Excuse me. Can I help you? Starting with common office objects. Hey, hey, hey! That's my stuff! Such as staplers and pins and all sorts of things like such as that. That's it. I'm calling security. No! [ Muffled grunting ]  All right, okay, now we're in the quiet safe room where none of the people whose stuff I stole can get to us. Now, let's look at all the stuff we got. We got a bag of bobbish. That's eight brapples. We got a plumbus. That's 61/2 brapples. We got, uh, a crushed red party cups. [ Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! ] Welcome back to "funny songs." It's all improvised. It's very funny. I need a volunteer from the audience. Um, longtime fan of the show. Uh what do you do? What's your profession? I am a tax attorney. Okay, here we go. Hit hit the music.   I'm a tax attorney  oh, geez, oh  forget about everybody else  forget about Jesus Christ  forget about muhammad  forget about, uh All those religions   Badababadababop the end. Oh, my God. Oh, that was so, so funny.  Thank you.  You're welcome. Hey, um, security guards, take him out.  Get him out of here.  What? Get the orthodontist out of here. No! Why? [ Glass shatters ] Take him out of the audience. Kill him. Sic him. Demons Suck his life out. I don't give a shit.  Smith family?  Yes? I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.  Yay! Called it!  Yes! Whoohoo! That's good news! But, uh, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me? Hi, honey, so, here's the thing these guys they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart. And we just need you to sign off on it.  What?!  Uhoh. Maybe we got a problem here after all, guys. Yikes. His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic. Now, there's a wide range of options to choose from. They're all in this catalogue. I don't care about prosthetics. This is insane. What do you people think you're doing? I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith. Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency treatment. He's gone an hour. And now you want his penis, and you hand me some Catalog. It's it's it's it's I mean Sheesh. Well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand, but on earth, love comes first. There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that shrimply pibbles represents love between all life. His fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient lifeforms. Whoa! Whoa. So, billions of lifeforms? Hundreds of billions. I mean, Jerry, yyou didn't explain the full gravity of the situation. Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her lover intact? Well, I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, the whole paradigm has sexist overtones. Beth, can we talk about this privately. You know, I think the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, "I prefer to keep my penis." But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis?! Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way? Hey, listen, is your mouth tiny and small? Then why don't you come to lil' bits Man: Lil' bits! where the food is tiny. It looks like regular food, but really tiny. You can put it in your mouth and eat it. Nothing gets stuck in your lips. It's just tiny and tiny and fits right  fits right in.  Lil' bits! We got tiny lasagna, tiny Pizza, tiny pie. Mmm! Little, tiny fried eggs. Oh, shit. We got tiny people. Lil' bits! You hungry? Come on down. Lil' bits. Eat some [Bleep] shit, you [Bleep] stupid bitch. [ Chuckles ] Just kidding. You've got some time to kill before the procedure, so I assume you'd like to, uh, use your penis one last time. Here's my computer. It's got the alien Internet on it. Here's some porn. And there's an alien towel. I actually got that on another planet. So it is an alien towel to me.  Good luck.  Thanks. [ Door closes ] [ Sighs ] What is this? Hmm. Hey, wait a minute. Oh, uh, Mr. Smith? Uh, yeah, just masturbating! I forgot to mention, there are extensive medical records open on my desktop, and I trust you to confine your activities  to the purely pornographic.  Absolutely! Good luck. [ Clicks ] My God! [ Chuckles ] Mr. pibbles, you just wrote my penis a oneway ticket to staying on my body town. Announcer: It's the opposite news with Michael Thompson. Hey, everybody. It's me, Michael Thompson. Today the pope didn't get killed. He's perfectly fine. And he's on vacation in Aruba. In other opposite news, information Hey, Rick, what's the deal with this guy? Wwhy is his body, like, sloping off to the right side of the screen like that? I don't know, Morty. See what else is on, huh? Hey, welcome to "cooking things." I'm pichael Thompson. Hey, wait a minute, Rick. This guy's body is, like, sloping down and leaning off to screen left. Oh, my God, and his name's pichael. I'm cooking a little bit of this. I'm gonna cook a little bit of that. Oh, oh, hey! Stop tugging, Michael! Oh, my God! Siamese twins! They're they're siamese twins! You quit tugging. II'm in the middle of my news. Oh, oh, it's always about you, isn't it? Can you believe this guy, ladies and gentlemen? He's got his own news show. He's got a normal name.  Hey, flip back to the news.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You could tell our parents started with naming with him. It's like, "oh, Michael." They had that one planned before they even got pregnant, I bet. I don't want to be that girl, but maybe there would be less conflict if they didn't shoot their shows at the same time. Oh, summer, you have no idea how much money that must save production. And then they found out I was attached, along for the ride, and they said, "ah, shit." Well, just [Bleep] it, call him pichael." [Bleep] You, pichael. You're a [Bleep] piece of shit.  [ Camera shutters clicking ] Good afternoon. I know all of you are wondering about the condition of our dear, beloved pibbles. Which would you prefer between the xp20 and the xp20 xs? I prefer my own penis, and so should you! The brave earth man whose sacrifice is going to allow shrimply pibbles to live Mr. Jerry Smith. [ Cheers and applause ] Hello, everyone! Let's hear it again for shrimply pibbles, huh? He's a good guy, isn't he? I've only just been learning about his accomplishments, from his march on flirk blirk square to his ongoing battle with heroin dependency. He's the best. [ Cheers and applause ] Um, yeah. Well, Iit occurs to me that his heroin addiction may not have been a matter of public record. You realize heroin makes up on shrimply pibbles' home planet. His planet was destroyed by clorgon death squads. He can't live outside of it without breathing heroin. Right. I know that. I just think This guy's trying to get out of giving away his penis! [ Crowd shouting ] Narrator: Today on "how they do it" Plumbuses. Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First, they take the dinglebop, and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then repurposed for later batches. They take the dinglebop, and they push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it. It's important that the fleeb is rubbed because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice. Then a schlami shows up, and he rubs it and spits on it. They cut the fleeb. There's several hizards in the way. The blamfs rub against the chumbles. And the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular, old plumbus. I always wondered how, uh, plumbuses got made. Hey, welcome back to "personal space." I'm your host Phillip Jacobs, and let me tell you, I care about my personal space. Whoa, whoa. Hey. Who's around me right now? Who's around me? Now, why don't we step up here and everybody get stepped up and let's get some steppedup personal space up in this place. Here we go. We get a one, personal space. Two, personal space. Three, stay out of my personal space. Four, keep away from my personal space. Five Get out of that personal space. Six Stay away from my personal space. Seven Keep away from that personal space. Eight, personal space. Nine, personal space. You know, I take personal space pretty seriously, up to the point that I don't even care about this I'm not even interested in having this skin on my personal space. [ Groans ] Oh, my God! Oh, it hurts! Gross! Rick: [ Laughs ] What an asshole! Ohh, tune in next week [ Theme music plays ] to the best show ever, the show we all grew and love "the personal space show." Announcer: More "personal space" next Tuesday at 8:00. Up next, the heat is turning up with Samantha and the boys on "the northsiders." [ Speaking alien language ] [ Whistle blows ] If you could all just stop screaming and chanting and making whatever that gesture means excuse me. Come on. Please, everyone, I have news about shrimply pibbles. Word of Jerry Smith trying to weasel out of his penis donation has spread across the galaxy. Beings everywhere have come together to offer what little they have to help save shrimply's life. Enough to pay for a brandnew, stateoftheart synthetic heart that will be even better than Mr. Smith's pathetic penis. Wait! That was an option the whole time?! You guys suck! Yeah. We suck. Are you still here? Okay, Jerry. Let's head home. I can't leave now. Everyone hates me. Unfortunately, there's no surgical procedure that can fix that. Or is there? [ Monitor beeping ]  Scalpel.  Scalpel.  Nanodoctor.  Nanodoctor. Nanoscalpel. Nanoscalpel. Okay. We're ready. Not so fast! Mr. Smith? What are you doing? Are you insane?! I'm a good person, and I demand that you cut off my penis and put it in that man's chest. That's not how it works! Well, you're gonna make it work. [ Knocking ] I'm octopus man! [ Laughs ] I'm octopus man! [ Laughs ] I'm a marine biologist who was bitten by an octopus. [ Laughs ] And now I'm I help people. I save people. I'm a troublesome octopus person. Uhoh. I got to save some trouble 'cause here comes a trouble mite. Summer: Gross! Does all interdimensional TV have to rely on juvenile violence? Well, summer, maybe people that create things aren't concerned with your delicate sensibilities, you know? Maybe the species that communicate with each other through the filter of your comfort are less evolved than the ones that just communicate! Maybe your problems are your own to deal with, and maybe the public giving a shit about your feelings is a oneway ticket to extinction! Geez, Morty. I take it Cathrine hefflefinger hasn't texted you back yet. I don't want to talk about it. Okay, guys, let's go home.  Where's dad?  Breaking news. Shrimply pibbles is being held hostage by the human known as Jerry Smith. Remove my penis!  [ Gasps ]  Holy crap! It's cool. It's fine. It's got to be from an alternate reality, right?  Are you sure?  I don't know. Do it! Do it! Remove my penis! Sir, put the gun down and step away from Mr. pibbles!  Jerry!  Dad, what are you doing?! I'm a good person. I'm a good person. Where did he get a gun? Who gave him a gun? That's not a gun. That's the xp20 xs. Ah! Oh, my God. I'm a good person. [ Screaming ] [ Distorted screaming ] No! Nooooo! [ Monitor beeping ] [ Both screaming ] Man: Hey, how's it going? This is my butthole ice cream parlor. I got all kinds of ice cream peanut butter and jelly [ Farts ]  Vanilla [ Farts ]  Chocolate [ Farts ]  And every flavor served out of a butthole  [ Groaning ]  Just like you're back home.  Dad!  Dad! What happened? Where am I? Was it all a dream? No, you were shot like 50 times. you're in a supersophisticated alien hospital, so it was basically like getting a splinter removed. All all I wanted was for everyone to like me. Jerry, remember that time you left a comment underneath that YouTube video and someone replied and called you a dumbass, so you replied and told them, "it takes one to know one," and you stayed up all night hitting "refresh" on your browser waiting for them to reply and then you fell asleep crying? I remember it differently. This is like that. You can't make people like you. You just have to wait for hating you to bore them. You know, you're right. I shouldn't be motivated by other people's opinions of me. All right, guys, let's go home. If it's all the same to you, Rick, I'd like to go to the zoo  With my family.  What?! What are you talking about?! Why would we do that?! It's a stupid idea! What's the matter with you!? Don't be a piece of shit, Jerry! Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We'll go home. What the hell is he talking about?!   Aah!  I'm the eyehole man! What is going on? Aah! Give me my eyeholes! Give me my eyeholes! Give me my eyeholes! I'm eyehole man! That part of the cupboard is mine, Jerry! Why do you even have those?!  Give me my eyeholes!  Help me, please! Get up on out of here with my eyeholes!
I got to tell you, Rick. It's pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style. I agree, Morty. [ Belches ] It's nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixedbag of a year. Ohh! Relax. That's what windshields are for. I didn't know that there were bugs out in space. Well, wwhat did you think, Morty? Life just developed on earth by itself? Here, let me take care of this. Geez, Rick, that's disgusting. I don't want to look at that. Yeah, guess I'm out of fluid. Llet me find a place to stop. Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us? The general store ought to have what you need. Thanks. Of course, you'll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown. Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why? Sundown is when the festival begins. The festival? Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace. Oh, I know what this is! You've been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence. That's right. What?! It's like "the purge," Morty. That movie "the purge"? Oh, have you been here before? No, no, but I've been to a few planets with the same gimmick. You know, sometimes it's called the cleansing or the red time. There was this one world that called it just murder night. Iit's a purge planet. They're peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge. Tthat's horrible! Yeah. You want to check it out?  [ Electricity crackling ] So, what do you do during the festival? You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff? Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff. Oh, I bet you do, old timer. [ Laughs ] Gee Rick, come on. The sun is setting. Wwe got to get out of here. All right, well, wwhat do I owe you for the wiper fluid? It's on the house. Oh, and, uh, why  why don't you have some candy bars, as well? Oh, no way. That's really nice of you. I'm a nice guy For now. [ Chuckling ] Ohh, I don't doubt it. Rick! Yeah, yeah. Hey, have a good festival, old timer. I intend to. Rick, unlock it! Just a second, Morty. Oh, look at that sunset. Stop screwing around. [ Click ] There we go. Much better. Now we can see. Great. Hey, you know what, Morty? Why don't we christen our squeakyclean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it? What?! No! What is your problem?! Morty, grow up. If you don't want to watch, don't watch, but, you know, it's my car. [ Belches ] Also, if you tell your mom about this, I'll purge you. You're the worst. And this planet is the worst. How can you be into this? You know, people are gonna kill each other. So, what, yyyou trying to sit here and tell me that [belches] Iif  if there's a video online with someone getting decapitated, you don't click on it? No! Why  why would I do that? You do that? I don't, because it would bore me. I see [Bleep] like that for breakfast, Morty. But if you don't do it, I say it's because you're afraid of your own primal instincts. So you stuff them down and  [ Bell chiming ] Oh, oh! Shh. Shh. It's starting. Ohhoho! Here we go. I'm not watching. Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal's in the mail. I'm gonna get a closer look. Oh, okay, sure. And then someone's gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we're gonna crash and we're gonna be stuck down there and it's gonna be what we deserve. Yawn. Whoa! [ Indistinct shouting ] Whoa, they are purging the [Bleep] out of each other. [ Muffled screaming ] Oh, my God! Oh [Bleep] That was  okay, yeah. Tthat was gross. Wow. Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, Morty. Ugh. My appetite for purgespectating got filled pretty quick. Oh, God. [ Grunts ] [ Retching ] [ Woman screaming ] Get away from me! No! No! Help! Somebody help me! Aah! All right, Morty. Llet's get out of here. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wwe have to go down there. [ Belching ] What? Why? That poor girl. Wwe have to save her. Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the noninterference policy. We got the wiper fluid. We watched them kill each other. We're leaving. Help me save that girl, or I'm telling mom you brought me here. You little turd. [ Screaming ] Please! Leave me alone! Leave you alone? During a purge? I don't think so, baby. It's okay. We're not gonna hurt you. My name is Morty. This is my grandpa. We're tourists. Not anymore. Aah! Aah! Oh, my God. This is [Bleep] awesome! Morty, this is really cool. Hey, yyou want to help me out here and kill some people? It's fun. We're totally justified because we're saving a little girl. I mean, wwwe're both free and clear to murder these people. Are you okay? Yes. I have to find somewhere to hide. Well, you can hide with us. Rick? Yeah? Do you think we could take  wwhat's your name? Arthrisha. Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge? Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you've done to blackmail me? Your vehicle  is it from the gods? No. Yes. So, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like, "wait, what? This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?" Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it. Yeah, I bet. [ Chuckles ] I bet. Yeah, it's kind of like cellphones, you know? At first, everyone was like, "look at those douchebags purging," and then the next thing you know, they're like, "it's just so convenient." Geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, Morty? Whatcha doing? Watching some TV, playing on your phone? Is that a real question? Just making conversation. Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with? My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark "yes" like a trained animal. It's not a conversation. You're holding me verbally hostage. Okay, assface. I'll go in the kitchen. Hey, dad. Yeah? Whatcha doing? Going into the kitchen? Okay. Yeah, you like that? Screw you. So, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge? II don't want to answer any more purge questions. All right, hey, hey, that's cool. I can roll with that. [ Blowing raspberries ] [ Gasps ] My Nana! Huh? My Nana! We have to save her! You just now remembered your Nana exists. II was traumatized. Haven't you been through like 15 purges? I mean, some as a child? Will somebody just help me get her? Fine, whatever. Morty, stay. Oh, God. Oh, crap. Oh, crap! Get out! Get out! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Get the [Bleep] out of the flying machine! Oh, my God! Ookay! Okay! Back up, asshole. [ Whimpers ] Back up. Ohh. Back the [Bleep] up! Aah! For what it's worth, I'm sorry, but that's not really worth anything tonight, is it? Yyou can't leave us here. You're killing us! You hear me? Come back. Yyou got to come back. Change your mind. Oh, geez. Morty! Aah! [Bleep] Amish bitch shot me! [ Grunts ] She tried to purge me, Morty. You let your wiener do the walking, and now I'm dead. Rick, she took the car! You [Bleep] kidding me, Morty?! She took my car and the gun. We're like the rest of these assholes now. Wwwe're gonna get purged, Morty. Help me up. Oh, geez, geez! Wait a minute, Rick. Why don't we just use your portal gun? It's in the car, dipass. [ Grunts ] Oh, God, it hurts. She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty. It's the hardestworking liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it. I hope it was worth it. I was just trying to do right. Yeah, well, that's not really the theme of tonight's party. Heads up. Rapists. Well, don't just stand there, Morty. Purge 'em. Me? No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them? Pick up a stick or something and kill them. Um, wwe come in peace. [ Screaming ] Oh, my God. [ Grunts ] There's more where that came from! You want to get purged, you bring it! Drop [Belches] drop your shit! Drop it all. Morty, go get their shit. Hurry up. I only had one of those things I threw. I'm holding a box of tic tacs right now. Want some crackers? No, thank you. Are you ready to be nice to me? In exchange for crackers? What happened to you? Dad, get a job. You're trying to create drama because you're bored. Oh. [ Beeping, whirring ] It's the space phone grandpa gave us. Hello? Hey, Summer, it's grandpa. I need you to do me a favor. I can barely hear you. Who is it? Morty and I are on a planet that's purging. I need you to take down  a plan that's what? We're on a planet that's purging, Summer. Purging. We lost our car and my gun, and we're in a purge. Ooh, is it taddi Mason? Like the movie "the purge"? Yes, II need you to take  that movie sucked. Oh, my God. Hold on. It's not taddi Mason? Dad, who the [Bleep] is taddi Mason? My friend. Aah! Are you okay? I'm putting you on speaker. Taddi? Yes, Jerry, it's taddi, a person no one's ever heard of until now, calling you on a space phone. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic. [ Growls ] Aah! [ Growling ] [ Gunshots ] Reload, fast. Summer, wwe need you to take down this number. Quit screwing around. Morty? Are you all right? No! Why are you with taddi Mason? Holy [Bleep] dad! Shut the [Bleep] up! Okay. I guess I'm just this entire family's toilet paper. Are you writing this down? Will you please write this down? Summer: Yes, yes. 77198 [ Growling ] 36421125. Aah! [ Growling ] You son of a bitch! Morty, I don't want to be the "a little help" guy, but a little help? Aah! Okay, I have a pen. Go. A spoon, Morty? A spoon?! I'm sorry. There's a pile of silverware next to you, and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything? All right, okay! Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there's a red box with a keypad on it. You're gonna take that box outside, and you're gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad. Got it? Got it. Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad? I'm ignoring you. Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse, I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package. Just remember, if there's people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first. We're not purging anyone, Rick, all right? Wwill you stop it? Morty, if we're gonna survive tonight, you're gonna need to harness your repressed rage. I don't have any! Spoken like a person with repressed rage. [ Doorbell rings ] I take no part in the festival. If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly. No such agenda, chief. We're not too keen on the purge, either, sir. We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth. It's a different planet. By the way, life on other planets exists. Don't let it distract you. I'll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beaconsending on the condition that you listen to my tale. Okay. Deal. All right, I'm gonna go to the roof and set things up. Morty, you listen to his tale. Okay. [ Clears throat ] "Fade in. Exterior. Unnamed city. Day. The hustle and bustle is a symphony of progress. We pan past windows, each of which contain a different story, to find jacey lakims, 28  hot, but doesn't know it. Jacey stops when her high heel gets caught in the grating of a sewer. Suddenly, a man steps into frame and points a gun at her. This is not her day. Fade to black. Title  'three weeks earlier.'" [ sighs ] You really don't want to talk to me about this. Dad, grandpa and Morty are in danger. You're unemployed, and you're bored. They're a higher priority. Stop saying I'm unemployed! Okay, 77198364211 Good lord! Now what? [ Whirring, humming ] Look, I'm your father, and I love you is all I'm saying. I'll leave it at that. Fine, dad! [ Both scream ] Oh, he might have said to take it outside. Rick: Come on, Summer. How hard is it to type some numbers into a box? Target locked. [ Device beeps ] Oh, thank God. Well, I did my job. Summer did her job. Now all Morty has to do is finish listening to that tale. "Blane: Maybe I don't need a new friend. Jacey: Maybe you're the only friend I need. Blane: Need, or want? Jacey: I've never been much for wanting. Blane: Spoken like someone with needs." Oh, geez. Hmm? Uh, sorry. Kkeep going. "Jacey reaches out and touches his face. It's clear he needs what she wants. She's a woman. He's a man. The city burns in the background as he takes her in his arms. Fade out. Title  'the end' Question mark." Wow. Yeah? It's Ggood job. Good job. You liked it? Of course I did. You didn't laugh at the scene in the bar. IThought it was funny, but I wanted to hear the rest. Do you have any thoughts? Notes? No. II just enjoyed it. That's my note, you know? Please write more. Seems a little insincere. What? No. You don't have to mollycoddle me. I want to improve my writing. Tell me your real thoughts. All right. Well, um, I'm not a huge fan, personally, of the whole "three weeks earlier" teaser thing. I feel like, you know, we should start our stories where they begin not start them where they get interest get out. Um, what? No, I'm sick of this. You bang on my door, you beg me to help you, I share something personal with you, and you take a giant shit on it. Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon  well, you can't. I want you out of here. You're a petty person, and you're insecure, and you're taking it out on me. That's a good script. What the hell?! I don't care. I want you out. What? Take that thing down. Your grandson is a shitty person. Leave now. Morty! Rick, I didn't do anything. I sat through his entire screenplay  you "sat through it"? Yes! Did you want me to weep with joy? It's terrible! Whoa! Morty! We're guests here. I tried to be a good guest! He dragged it out of me! I'm taking down this beacon. No, stop! That's not fair! Just because you hate your own writing doesn't make me a bad person! Aah! You like that? You want me to cut to three weeks earlier when you were alive? Whoa, Morty. You just purged. Beacon arriving. [ Device beeps ] Okay, time to go. Well, terrific. [ Sighs ] Dad, what's going on? What's the deal here? I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter. You're growing up so fast. You used to be my little girl. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Remember when we used to go to the playground, and I'd push you on the swings? Oh, you could push me higher than all the other kids. You were so small and cute. I thought you were gonna fly right off into the street. [ Chuckling ] I used to pee my pants. I know, and now look at you! You have a job. You're making really good money. You're not paying any rent, so you have plenty of disposable income. Oh, God, dad. Please, don't. I just need a few hundred dollars to get through the month. I have some interviews coming up. Something's gonna come through. I can feel it. I'm going inside. [ Door shuts ] [ Sighs ] I guess this is what rock bottom feels like, Jerry. Ow! It's okay, Morty. It's the purge, you know? Pushing old lighthouse keepers down the stairs is totally cool. It's not cool, Rick. II'm not like these people. I can't run around chopping people's heads off one day a year and then sleep well the rest of the time. Well, you better start getting used to it, little bitch, because we got some [Bleep] company. Hey, there he is. Here I am. [ Beacon whirring ] Morty. Time to [Belches] purge. [ Gunfire, screaming ] [ Tony! Toni! TonÃ©!'S "feels good" plays ] [ Screaming ]  it feels good  yeah  it feels good  holdin' you so  it feels good geez. Wow, Morty. Now you're getting into it. Never expected that out of you. All right, uh, let's go find my ship. Hey, hey, Morty, Morty. There it is down there  my ship. It looks to me like the Morty? [ Gunfire ] Suck my [Bleep]  it feels good eat this! Ooh, boy, you're really, uh Haha! Ha!  it feels good you're really going for it over there, huh? I, uh [Belches] I think, uh [Belches] I think those people were just hiding. I don't give a [Bleep] [ Gunfire ] Okay, Morty, now you're just shooting corpses. How do you like this? Okay, buddy. All right. That's good. Good job. [ Screams ] Time to go home. [ Weapon charging ] Wait, stop! Please, don't kill me! II never intended to harm you, I swear. I am trying to end the festival. Wwwhat do you mean? I was going to use your ship to destroy the rich assholes that run our society and save my people from the horrors of this yearly festival. [Bleep] That, Rick! We got to kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Whoa! Geez, Morty, purge it down a little. "Purge! Don't purge!" You're sending me mixed messages, Rick. Morty [Belches] you're acting like a [Belches] freaking lunatic. Calm down. Screw you, Rick! I'll purge you, too, you old, rickety piece of crap! This has been a long time coming! I'm gonna rip your [Bleep] guts out and smear them all over your face! I ain't taking no sh aah! Okay, ssorry about that. Now, where are these rich people? [ String quartet playing ] [ Glass clinking ] To another successful year of the festival, pitting poor people against each other for thousands of years. [ Tony! Toni! TonÃ©!'S "feels good" plays ] Wait, wwhere is that music coming from? What is the meaning of this?  it feels good here's the deal. I'm not here to judge. I'm just a guy from another planet. But this girl is one of your poor people, and I guess you guys felt like it was okay to subject her to inhuman conditions because there was no chance of it ever hurting you. It's sort of the sociopolitical equivalent of, say, a suit of power armor around you. But now things are evened out, so, arthrisha? [ All gasp ] Happy festival [Bleep] suckers! Suck my [Bleep] chew my balls! Suck my huge [Bleep] Geez.  it feels good you want to get in on this, Rick? No, I really  honestly, II've had my fill. It's gratuitous at this point. You sure you don't want to join in? This is really amazing.  it feels good yeah, but  ah, all right. [Bleep] It.  It feels good yeah, bitch, what's up?  It feels good  it feels good  yeah  it feels good whoa!  Ohh, it feels good okay, now it's time we do a little dancing to  to Tony! Toni! TonÃ©!  it feels good, yeah look at my [Bleep] feet, mother [Bleep] Whoo! Aw, yeah!  it feels good arthrisha, what do you got? Check this move out.  oh, it feels good [ belches ] Oh, ho! I don't know what song that is, but I [Bleep] love it! "Feels good." It's a [Bleep] hit song.  it feels good topped the charts, I think. Ho, ho!  Oh, it feels good [ rooster crows ] Hey, thanks for helping me, Rick. You're a pretty great guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Bleep] You for shooting my liver. I'll see you around. Oh, man. What  what happened? Don't worry about it, Morty. Listen, if you wanted to try to get a piece, you better hurry up. Now's your last chance. Hey, hey, arthrisha, um, maybe I could  uh, I have a boyfriend. Okay. I'm not trying to be rude. I just  I don't want to lead you on. III understand. I mean, thank you so much for helping end the festival, but I have a boyfriend, and, uh, he's just  okay, okay, you can stop saying it. I took it okay the first time, and now you're just repeating stuff. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. Oh, you're so sweet, I just  oh, but I can't. Yeah, you're still doing it. It won't be easy creating a new society from the ground up. Well, a helpful rule might be if you need something, you get it. Pretty simple, right? I need food. Who's got food for that guy? I do, but this is for me. Can't you make some more? Oh, sure. And while I'm making food for everyone, who takes care of my kids? I'll take care of your kids, if I get some extra food for it. Extra food? Well, I'm not gonna do extra work if we all get the same. All right, okay, fair is fair. If you do extra work, you get extra food. Oh. [ All murmuring ] Who's gonna keep track of who gets how much food for how much work? Hello. I can do that. I'll keep track of everyone's food, you know, in exchange for food. That's not a real job! Oh, and making food is? You son of a bitch! Eat this! [ All screaming ] Guys, guys, guys, guys, whoa, whoa. Cool it, now. Take it easy. There's too much aggression here. What if we designate a period of time during which we can all get this hate, murder, and rage out of our system  I can't help but feel ashamed about what I did back there, Rick. I guess you were right. I've got a lot of repressed stuff I need to deal with. Don't worry about it, Morty. Remember those candy bars earlier that we got in the first act? Yeah, what about them? Turns out they have a chemical in them called purgenol that amplifies all your violent tendencies. Oh, boy. Whew! Thank goodness for that, huh? That's a relief. Yep. Don't even sweat. You're still the same old Morty. Your character's totally protected.  It feels good  Man: And there's the approach. Jerry, what is "taddi Mason llc," and why is our phone bill $700? Uh Hey, are you bored Uh Lonely, just looking for a friend? Uh Call me, taddi Mason. It's only $1.99 a minute to talk. Uh Sign up today, and I'll even call you on a regular basis Uh For just $1.99 a minute. That's a steal because I'm a great pal. Uh We could talk about sports or barbecue. [ Grunts ] Jerry, get a job.
The trick to cereal is keeping 70% above the milk. Jerry, get a job. Uh, wwhy don't you get it, Jerry? You're the man of the house, and you don't have a job. Delivery for Rick. Morning, Summer, Beth, and Jerry. Gross. What is that thing? It's a courier flap. It's like the intergalactic version of u.P.S., but less offputting. Oh, shiiit! It looks like an eggvite from birdperson. Must be time for his annual Oscar party. And, by the way, our TV signals take light years to reach his planet. Nobody tell him that "braveheart" wins. Greetings. This is birdperson. And Tammy! Inviting you to planet squanch for our matemelding ceremony blugh! If you're from earth, that means we're getting married! Oh, my God! My friend Tammy's marrying birdperson! What the hell is a birdperson? He's Rick's best friend. Uh, llet's not get carried away, Morty. Would you like to rsvp or send a gift? No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away, I'd hang out with Jerry all day. Affirmative! Returning to sender. No, hold on, stay, courier flaps. Staying! Dad, you have a friend that's getting married. That's a big deal. It's a big deal he has a friend. What do you know about friendship, Jerry? Confirmed, shipping Jerry. Whoa, whoa, wait! Aah! Oh, God! Jerry! Dad! Dad! Where is it taking him? I assume planet squanch Whoa, tthat's that's insane! Yeah, I know. Now we have to go to the wedding. * Rick Sanchez! You psycho bag of squanch! Hey, what's up, squanchy? Summer and Morty: Hey, squanchy. Morty, Summer! And you must be Beth. Mwah! Ensquanche! You're language has the word "squanch" in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out, like the smurf thing? Beth, squanchy culture is more contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand. Oh. Okay. I squanch my family. Uh What, I do. I squanch my family. Stop saying it. Gross. Come on in, guys. The guest are having cocksquanches. Where am I?! You're at a wedding. Go change. * And I'm an alien with jazz rap style * * Jazz rapping for an alien mile * * Fat beats and an alien smile * jazz space phone, alien dial is my friend * * I got a mouthful of jazz for your ass * * And I'm gonna keep jazzing Oh, you made it! I wouldn't it for the world! Oh, my God. I love your ring. Thanks. It was birdperson's grandmother's. She fought a squirrel for it. Birdperson. Rick, I am pleased you and your family could witness my melding with Tammy. Our pleasure. Yeah, I just hope you got a premeld. Rick! What?! It's just a practical way of making sure that when she's done with you, you can get one of your balls back. Jesus, dad. He's just grumpy from the flight. Ohh, II was happy on the flight. I'm grumpy from the landing. Well, I looked at the guest book. We don't know a damn person here. Hi! Jerry Smith father of the bride's friend. Advertising is my usual game, but I'm between Jerry, stop networking. We're in space. "Jerry, get a job! Jerry, don't look for a job at an alien wedding!" I don't get you. This is the closest I've ever gotten to this part of my father's life. I don't want to blow it. Okay, I get it. I'm cramping your style. You say you get it, but I'm scared you'll keep doing it. Look, here's some humans you can practice on. You must be Summer's mom and dad. We're Tammy's parents pat and Donna guterman. Hi. Beth. This is Jerry. So you're teenage daughter's marrying a birdman. Are you guys down with that? No pun intended. We're quite proud. He's a wonderful person and an incredible bird. Still, what is he, 40? It's just, you know, when he was 30, she was an actual child. When he was her age, she wasn't born. When he was, let's see, like, 18, she was literally in there in your womb. Imagine being pregnant with your daughter and a bird teenager comes into your home and says, "I'll take that. I'll have sex with that." Give us one second. Oof! Were you born with your feet in your mouth? I was transported here against my will in a meatball, all right? So take your attitude to the men's section of kmart, 'cause you need to cut me some slack S. I want you to stand in the corner and face the corner and talk to nobody. Maybe I Will. You know, you're not being very supportive of birdperson on his big day. Birdperson's big day, Morty, was at blood Ridge on glapflap's third moon against the gromflamites! This? This is a losing battle. Geez, Rick, it's not like he's dying. He's getting married! I mean, what do you think's gonna happen if you open yourself up a little bit? I mean, look around. This is your family and friends all around you, you know? Take the day off. There's nothing to run from, nothing to fight. That's his last name. Are you hyphenating it? Squanch this, mofo. Good one, Morty. Excuse me, bartender. Can you make me a dumb grandson pep talk? It's one part lame advice about stuff you know nothing about and a lot of vodka. Mmhmm. I have a lot of vodka. Then I'll take one of those. I don't need the rest. God, whatever, Rick. Oh, it sounds like you and my dad have a long history together. Wish I could say the same. The road your father and I walked together is soaked deeply with the blood of both friends and enemies. Must be nice. Um, I used to have to draw him into family photos with a crayon. The war in which we fought is far from over. We live our lives in hiding. I guess I should be happy for you. I mean, great, you guys got to hang out. I hope you had a blast. The galactic government considers us terrorists. It's unwise of me to share these details, but I've become inebriated. I don't know if you can appreciate what it means to grow up without a father, but the guest list at this wedding includes 17 of the federation's most wanted. We have committed numerous atrocities in the name of freedom. Annnd during that time, I don't suppose he ever mentioned his daughter. Are those baby quiches? Night crawler pate. I should prepare for the ceremony. Like talking to a brick wall. In the name of the squanch, the six rivers, the four squanches, and the nine balls, I unite these two organisms in eternal squanch! Tammy, you may squanch your vows now. Birdperson You are my seed, my worm, my earliness, and my lack of cats. I promise to be yours until your death. Nice! All: Aww! Birdperson. Tammy, I was approaching infertility when I met you, but there is still time. I am yours until my death. All: Aww! Aww. I now pronounce you squanch and birdperson! * Girl, you got it going on I am not staring at you. I am a cyborg photographer. Just act natural. This is a candid shot. I don't require a camera so sorry. Hi. I am not staring at you. Uh, hi, everybody. I'm rick. You know, when I first met birdperson, he was, uhh Listen, I'm not the nicest guy in the Universe because I'm the smartest. And being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets. Now, I haven't been exactly subtle about how little I trust marriage. I couldn't make it work, and I could turn a black hole into a sun, so at a certain point, you got to ask yourself what are the odds this is legit and not just some big lie we're all telling ourselves because we're afraid to die alone? Because, you know, that's exactly how we all die alone. Oh, boy. Oh, dad. Jesus. But but Here's the thing. Birdperson is my best friend, and if he loves Tammy, well, then I love Tammy, too. To friendship, to love, and to my greatest adventure yet opening myself up to others. Summer: Hear, hear! Cheers! Cheers to that, mother Thank you, Rick. That was beautiful. Gosh, I look around this room, and I think, "uh, Tammy, you're a highschool senior" from the planet earth, and you're marrying "a 40yearold birdperson? Like, what?!" Yeah, Tammy! But then I think, you know, in a lot of ways, I'm not a highschool senior from the planet earth. In a lot of ways, what I really am is a deepcover agent for the galactic federation, and you guys are a group of wanted criminals, and this entire building is, in a certain sense, surrounded. Oh, shit. IDon't get the metaphor. I'll explain it to you later. Everyone here is under arrest for crimes against the federation. L'Chaim! Tammy, what are you doing? Sit your bird ass down. Tammy? Birdperson!! No!! Holy Drop the portal gun. Slide it to the center of the room. Somebody confiscate that and don't damage it. They'll want it at There's no time to squanch! Get your family out of here! I got this. How about a taste of my squanch?! Come on, this way! Squanch this! Good thing I grabbed a space weapon. That's a confetti gun, you idiot! Beth: Dad! Hold on tight! Aaah!! Aaaah!! God damn it! God damn it!! What the hell happened back there?! This is on you guys. I told you weddings are stupid. Uh, Rick, is there anything you'd like to tell us about your relationship with this previously unknown galactic government? All the important points seem pretty clear, no? They think they control the galaxy, I disagree. Don't hate the player, hate the game, son. How could you be so dishonest with this family? Oh! Oh, should I have been more open and trusting and loving like, oh, I don't know, my now dead best friend? Or your daughter, who is bffs with an intergalactic narc? Hey, Tammy was cool! And now we know why. Because of you! You, Summer, and the government, and me for letting my guard down, which I will never do again. Geez, Rick! You can't say f "'f' you" to your granddaughter. I just did, Morty. Here's dessert. You. Look, I think we've all had a tough wedding. Actually, the wedding was beautiful. The reception got out of hand. Anyway, I say we go home, sleep it off, and have a family meeting in the morning. Yeah, about going home, we can't ever. All: What?! Oh, these guys are looking for us now. Earth will be swarming with them. Us?! Jerry I want to go home! Look, anyone that wants to go back to earth is free to go back to earth. But here's what's gonna happen. Aliens bureaucrats are gonna arrest you. They're gonna put the intergalactic equivalent of jumper cables under your nuts and or labia and hook them up to an alien car battery until you tell them where I am which I guarantee you, you're not gonna know, which I guarantee they won't believe. So who's homesick? By applause. Ladies? Anybody? What are we going to do? Where are we going to live? Take it easy. This is a blessing in disguise. Earth. You realize our planet's name means dirt, right? We'll find a new world. Computer, how many planets in the milky way are at least 90% similar to earth? Woman: 765 known planets. How many of those are outside federal jurisdiction? Three. See? Our cup runneth over. Now, who wants to go shopping for a brandnew motherworld?! All right! Look at this baby! Would you even know that wasn't earth? Morty: Yes, because there's no Africa. Pssh. Whitepeople problems, Morty. Let's go down and check her out. Oh. I thought it was further away. I uh I guess this one's a little small. All right, uh, maybe maybe we should go check out the other two, huh? Okay, this one's bigger. This looks nice. Mom, dad, look! Strawberries on a cob! Whoa! Hey, check this out! Flowers on a cob! Huh. Strawberries and flowers on a cob, huh? That's pretty cool. Are those Mountains on a cob? Rick: Oh, my God. Get in the ship, sweetie. What? Get in the godship!! Everything's on a cob!! The whole planet's on a cob!! Go, go, go!! All right, third time's the charm. See what we got here. Seems good. And nothing on the cob. Didn't know that was a necessity, but No, it's nice. I think this might be it. Wow! Hey, look, you guys. The sun's rising. Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!! Uh, dad, how long are the days on this planet? Uh, computer, how long are the days on this planet? 42 hours. All right, well, those are the two choices, 'cause cob planet is off the table. Now let's take a vote. Man: Well, it's official. The obscure planet known as earth, formerly the hiding place of interstellar terrorist and fugitive Rick Sanchez, has just become the 6,048th planet to join the galactic federation. The plucky little ball of water and dirt, which is where it gets its name, is dominated by seven billion primatedescended natives who love to eat spaghetti and pray to kangaroos. Spaghetti, kangaroos? I've got to check this place out. Well, you can. Contact the ministry of tourism for details. Up next, teenagers are calling it And it's not what you think. What are you what did you do that for? Dramatic effect. Good morning, family. Oh, do I smell bacon? Yes, we discovered a species of tiny pig off the coast of new Australia about 30 yards east. Or 300 yards west. We'd offer you some, but we hunted it to extinction for breakfast. Well, I thought I'd walk to the South pole and do a little bit of exploring. If you guys need me, just yell or throw something so hard that it goes around the world and hits me. Okay, now that he's gone, can we please talk about our situation? Dad, you can't talk about people behind their back. You know, it's a small world. Please, he's in the South pole! And we need to have a serious conversation. South pole discovered, baby! Ohhhh! Oh an ice cave? Things just keep on getting better. Wow, it's the planet's core. I'm just saying, we keep acting like there's only two options, but there's not. So, yes, if we went back to earth, as long as Rick was out there, they'd want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father in to the government? Jerry, so help me God, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon. There already is no more bacon! This world sucks! Our life sucks! Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself? Morty: That's not the point, dad! We love Rick Ffor the most part. Summer: Yeah, you don't love people in hopes of a reward, dad, you love them unconditionally. That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you. Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants? All: Yes. Why?! Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb asshole!! Hey. Uh I was gonna hope over to the gloppydrop system, get some ice cream. You you want me to come with? I mean, don't you need my brain waves for camouflage or something? I'll be okay. Bye, Morty. Rick? You're not leaving, right? Yeah, I am. To get ice cream. So, you're coming back? Morty, if you go to where there's a bunch of ice cream and then you don't come back, you haven't actually gotten ice cream, you've just gone where ice cream is. Rick, I can handle it if you go, but you'll break mom's heart. And I won't forgive you for that. Where's the van, Morty? It's over the horizon in the driveway. * I hurt myself today For English, press 2. Connecting to agent. Woman: Ongoing investigations. Uh, hi, my name is Jerry Smith, I'm from planet earth.

1 Rick: Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison!  Oh, scary place.  Wow, Rick! That's  That's one  one heck of a story.  I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen. Oh, come on.  Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade scifi tools  to take out highly trained alien guards  when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?  Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are,  but wouldn't you like to go home?  Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.  Yeah, but you just got out of prison.  I mean, how much of a step up from that is   Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off,  and fold yourself 12 times.  You got it.  [ Grunting ]  Six folds, huh?  WWWhat, have you guys got me in a Series 9000?  You cheap insect [bleep] didn't think I was worth your best equipment?  [ Chuckles ] Man, I told the money bugs.  I said, "You know who this guy is, right?  You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal  in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."  Well, you might as well order some pancakes,  because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.  Oh, I think you do.  Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum  Shoney's. or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.  [ Farts ] Relaxed enough? [ Chuckles ]  I admire you, Rick. [ Farts ]  [ Laughs ]  When I  [ Farts ]  [ Laughs ]  Rick, here's  [ Farts ]  [ Laughs ]  What's going on?  It's hard to tell. He may have manifested some sort of butt.  He can do that?  He is the smartest man in the universe.    [ Sighs ]  I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth   best thing that's ever happened to this family.  I just got my sixth promotion this week,  and I still don't know what I do.  Who cares how high they promote you?  Everyone just gets paid in pills.  Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living,  youcan make your own rules.  Summer, show your father some respect.  He's pulling down a sixchewable figure income.  [ Bottle shatters ]  I'll get that in a moment. How are everyone's pills?  Oh, Morty, you've hardly touched your pills.  I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  [muffled] wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  [ Gulps ]  Thank you, Conroy.  You spoil us, Conroy.  Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!  Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.  Willem Dafoe!  ThThat's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.  Don't make my mistake, Summer.  Don't deify the people that leave you.  You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens  whose medicine keeps horses  [sobs] healthy forever.  [ Sniffles ] Horses live longer than tortoises now.  Is that what you want for yourself?  Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!  Who saved room for pill brÃ»lÃ©e?  Ooh! [ Chuckles ]  I can see why you chose this familyfriendly restaurant  to represent your cerebellum.  So safe, so comfortable, so Shoney's.  But admit it, Rick  you're going crazy cooped up in here.  Let's go visit some memories.  Oh, any particular ones?  You want to see my first boner,  or should we go straight to the moment  I discovered interdimensional travel?  [ Squeals ] Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching.  Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal  that one of your buddies found a grape?  It's arousal.  Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory  of you inventing your portal gun.  Yeah, well, tough titties. [ Rumbling ]  There's no tougher titty than a psychotic break, Rick.  Well, that depends on who breaks first  me or the titty.  Someone special you remember?  Is that your memory of her out there   between where you were on 9/11  and your favorite sports blooper?  [ Whooshing ]  If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories.  If you take me where I want to go  she'll be there, too, won't she?  The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.  Oh, that sounds cool.  I can get what I want and you can say goodbye.  [ Sighs ] Fine, but I'm driving.  as an excuse to strip away our freedom.  Huh? What are you  What are you doing?  Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right?  With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank!  And we can go break him out of prison!  Look at these dead flies!  Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order,  it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.  Summer, you're freaking me out.  I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick,  but getting him back wouldn't make things better.  And, you know, we're not doing so bad.  We're miserable, Morty!  There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47,  and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!  Hey, I like being 35. II can rent a car now.  Because you suck.  You've been keeping your lip zipped about it  since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is,  you're freaking stoked to bail on him.  He bails on everybody!  He bailed on Mom when she was a kid!  He  He bailed on tiny planet!  And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer,  he bailed on you.  He left you to rot in a world that he ruined  because he doesn't care!  Because nobody's special to him, Summer,  not even himself.  So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel.  The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!  You're right!  What?! No, I'm not right.  II was using ghoulish overkill!  Ghoulish overkill, Summer!  [ Summer grunting ]  [ Thunder crashes ]  Oh, God! Oh, God!  Whoa, whoa!  [ Thunder crashes ]  Where are we going?  To the day it all began and ended.  The moment that changed everything.  Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order?  Yeah, I'd like to get a 10piece McNugget  and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce.  Like, as much as you're allowed to give me.  In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film "Mulan,"  where they  where they   they created a new sauce for the McNuggets  called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious!  And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone.  This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.  Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting.  Okay. All right, all right.  Is that Me.  I used to wear blue pants.  When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?  I didn't. Idid.  Well, well, well.  If it isn't us.  You know the worst part about inventing teleportation?  Suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy,  and the first thing you learn is,  you're the last guy to invent teleportation.  Fortunately, you're about to invent something much more powerful.  [ Squeals ]  What?  [ Thunder crashes ]  Summer, nobody has to know about that.  We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it,  like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.  Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself.  And how are you gonna do that? I don't know yet.  I'll make it up as I go.  That's what Grandpa Rick does.  That's what heroes do.  YYou want to see what a hero Rick is?  II'll bring you somewhere, Summer.  Um My goodness, children.  [ Sternly ] Relinquish the illegal technology  to the nearest Federation representative.  [ Normal voice ] And then we'll all play Balderdash.  [ Both whimper, scream ]  [ Screaming ]  [ Farting ]    [ Grunts ] Oh, my goodness! Oh, oh! My goo  [ Crackling ]  Oh, my God.  I have that exact same top.  What is this place?  And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer?  That's my sister. This used to be my home.  Imagine doing anything you want,  then hopping to a timeline where you never did it.  Imagine going anywhere, anytime,  with nobody able to stop you.  Sounds lonely.  Lonely? Dude, you have yourself   your infinite selves.  It's a nonstop party where all the guests  are the only person we like.  You think it's cool being the smartest man on Earth,  but once we give you this technology,  you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe   the Infinite Rick, a god.  Eh, pass.  Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.  Who do you think you are?  A different kind of Rick, I guess.  Well, we'll see how long that lasts.  I heard scifi noises.  Did you make a breakthrough?  Sort of.  I just took a long look at myself,  and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off.  Well, why don't I get Beth and we'll go out for ice cream?  That, Dianne, is the last great idea  that will ever be had in this garage.  [ Munching loudly ]  Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume.  Mom, you're looking feral.  I can't believe Rick did this.  These are the parts of Rick's adventures  you don't get to see  the parts he leaves behind.  All right, it's been great, guys.  I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick "I told ya so."  So, uh Looking for this?  What are you doing with that?!  It stinks of Rick. [ Grunts ]  No! Why?! Why would you do that?!  WWWhat is the matter with you people?!  You can never leave. She cannot remain.  She stinks of Rick.  [ All scream ]  Hold your fire! Hold your fire!  I'm Morty C137.  We detected a compromised portal gun. Where is your Rick?  He's in prison. Summer.  He got captured by the Federation  and we were going to rescue him.  Very troubling. We can't risk Citadel secrets  falling into the Federation's hands.  We'll dispatch S.E.A.L. Team Ricks immediately  to break into the prison holding C137.  Booyah. And assassinate him.  Boonah?  [ Horn honks ] Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt.  [ Munching ]  [ Whooshing ]  [ Beeping ]  Nooooooo!  Wow. This sauce is [bleep] amazing.  You said it was promoting a movie?  [ Slurping ]  Carry the three, add a two.  I got it. I [bleep] got it.  Whoa. IIs that it, the portal gun?  Yeah. That's the three lines of math  that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.  Awesomepossum.  [ Whirring ]  Mission Control, you getting this?  Holy shit, yes! Yes, we got it! Yeah!  Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer.  Actually, I think it shuts off automatically  once your brain is liquid.  Don't know, don't care.  Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out. Can you hear me?  Nope, they cannot. Why not?  Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portalgun formula,  it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.  What are you talking about? This is a memory.  YYou can't alter details of a memory.  True, but you can alter anything you want  about a totally fabricated origin story.  It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's!  Repeat  we never left his Shoney's!  Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.  Roger that.  Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain.  I'm gonna transfer to yours.  Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius,  so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture,  my desire to play the trumpet,  my tentative plans to purchase a hat,  and six years of improv workshops.  Comedy comes in threes.  It's a trap! Abort! We never left his   [ Farts ] [ Laughs ]  No!  Another day, another dollar.  Am I great insect creature or what?!  Congratulations, Agent.  You'll be highly commended for this.  Always wait for permission to [burps] feel accomplishment.  That's my motto. One thing still perplexes me   why would Rick Sanchez turn himself in?  Well, I'm just a dumbass bug, but it's possible Rick knew  he'd be interrogated at this facility,  where we not only keep our most wanted,  but our most sensitive data.  Anyone here with levelnine access could [burps]  I don't know, collapse a government.  I'm just gonna go take a dump.  Is it cool if I use the levelnine bathroom?  WWWhat's the levelnine master access code again?  Oh, that's easy  83  Yeah!  S.E.A.L. Team Ricks in the house!  [ Screaming ]  Hi, Rick.  Bye, Rick.  D99, yyou okay?  [ Grunting ]  I'm bummed I didn't get to give that insect dick a testdrive.  Wait, wait, wait, wait! TThe Council of Ricks sent us.  We have your Morty and Summer.  They're prisoners on the Citadel.  Great! [ Grunts ]  Security breach in room 6755.  Lovely. Not only is my plan screwed up,  I also forgot how to improvise.  All security people approach. [ Grunts ]  Security breach.  A city of Grandpas?  Morty: It's the Citadel of Ricks.  All the different Ricks from all the different realities  got together to hide here from the government.  But if every Rick hates the government,  why would they hate Grandpa?  Because Ricks hate themselves the most.  And our Rick is the mosthimself.  Not anymore, homey.  S.E.A.L. Team Ricks turned his unibrow  into two brows  with a bullet.  [ Laughter ]  Your Rick's dead! Your Rick's dead!    Sir, Rick D99 is returning from the mission alone.  Apparently, S.E.A.L. Team Ricks suffered heavy casualties.  Bring him in.  He says he'll only talk to a Rick with higher clearance.  Ladida. Give me that.  D99, this is the commander in chief of the Citadel's militia.  Go[burps]  good enough.  He's a spy. Blow him up. I'm gonna go take a shit.  Operating an unregistered portal gun,  radicalizing a Summer,  conspiring with a traitorous Rick.  How do you plead?  How is this a fair trial?  OOur lawyer is a Morty.  It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer.  We just keep him here because he's fun.  Look at him go.  [ Laughs ] Ha ha, yeah!  We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick.  What say you, Summer?  I say [bleep] you!  My grandpa was my hero.  You killed him because you were jealous of him.  That's pretty obvious from the haircuts.  So do what you want to me, but let my brother go.  He already renounced Rick.  Morty?  [ Whispers indistinctly ] What?  NNo, I don't want to see your Pog collection.  I don't renounce Rick, and I never have.  I was just trying to protect my sister.  I wanted you to have a normal life.  That's something you can't have when Rick shows up.  Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong.  All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything.  And, well  well, he's not a villain, Summer,  but he shouldn't be your hero.  He's more like a demon or a super [bleep]up god.  Let's not suck the ghost of his [bleep] too hard.  He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.  Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive.  And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!  [ All grumbling ]  [ Whistling ]  Hey, whoa, whoa! What are you doing in here?  This area's for teleporting the entire Citadel  to somewhere else using only buttons and dials.  Yeah, well, it's a bad idea  to have it designed that way then, isn't it?  [ Whirring ]  [ Screaming ] What the [bleep]  We just teleported into a galactic federal prison.  I'm gonna go take a shit. [ Alarm blaring ]  Lawyer Morty: Order in the court!  Whoa! What the hell?! Oh, my God!  [ Screaming ]  Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!  Whoa! [ Screaming ]  Whoa!  The Citadel's been teleported to [burps] Federation space.  It's doomed. This has to be C137, you guys.  What are we gonna do?! You know he's coming for us.  All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage.  Obviously, I get her.  You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.  WWWhat the hell is that?  Payback.  [ Screaming ]  Grandpa Rick!  Duh! You're alive!  Rick! Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.    Hold on, hold on. Whoa!  Council Member: That's enough, Rick.  What  What's this supposed to accomplish?  We have infinite grandkids.  You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.  That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.  You're a rogue Rick  irrational, passionate.  You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.  I came to kill you, bro.  That's not even my original Summer.  Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!  RRick? Why not shoot through her?  20 yards, ninegauge plasma pistol,  My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you,  second shot adds recoil.  The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her,  which I'm encouraging you to do.  What the [bleep] Or let her go,  which I will reward with a quicker death.  Because you love her!  Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot,  which will be your least painful death.  But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it.  All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.  I hate you! Not an issue, sweetie.  That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!  Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this,  but you're really [bleep] this up right now.  I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!  I wasn't gonna let her die, you [bleep] moron!  Ha! Aww.  The point is hethought I was going to.  I totally did, by the way.  You're a [bleep] moron, Morty.  Morty, you [bleep] idiot!  You're a serious [bleep] idiot, Morty!  You basically killed us all!  You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.  [ All yelling ]  [ Screaming ]  Who's stupid now, bitch?!  Morty, we just got him back!  [ Laughs ]  That was amazing, Morty.  Oh, my God. Wow.  Okay, let's wrap this  Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.  What?! What happened?  Oldest Rick trick in the book.  "Fake gun, shoot me in standoff."  Brilliant. Ha, yeah.  GGood thing I saw that note.    Can't we just portal home?  Not until I finish what I started.  And that is how you get levelnine access  without a password.  Freeze!  Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.  So, what are you doing with levelnine access anyways?  Destroying the [burps] galactic government. Awesome!    Whoa, cool!  Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?  Ooh, or  or reprogram their military portals  to disintegrate their entire space fleet?  Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud.  But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire  by changing a one to a zero.  Mr. President, the Blemflarck's value just dropped to nothing.  What do you mean? I mean, our single centralized galactic currency  just went from being worth one of itself to zero of itself.  [ Panicked murmuring ] Calm down, people.  Deploy the galactic militia and declare martial law.  Yes, sir.  Uh, what should I pay them with?  Their payment is the honor they'll feel to serve their   Wait.

Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.  Wwwhat are you doing there, Beth?  What are you doing there, sweetie?  Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle  full of liquid unrelated to your situation.  How's that gonna help?  Can't argue with that.  Great. We'll see you later.  Hey, hey, be careful with that.  It's for something else.  It's really important,  so don't break it.  Okay, I may have [bleep] up here.  Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah.  Tttah, tah.  Oh, great.  Stupid cat.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like  to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake!  I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared  of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes.  I'm not a snake!  I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!  Whoa!  Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Oh, crap, that sun is bright.  Okay, come on.  This can't really be the way I go out.  This is the megagenius equivalent  of dying on the toilet.  So hot.  This is how I'm gonna die.  Oh, God, moisture.  Oh, God, the moisture Dial it back, God.  Dial it back a little bit here!  Oh! Oh.  Oh, God!  Perpendicular, perpendicular!  Oh, shit!  Oh! Oh!  Oh!  Come on. That's it.  Come get this delicious brine.  Aah!  Come on! Come on, mother[bleep]!  Come on!  Yes!  How is this even family therapy  if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?  Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?  It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs.  The family was told to get counseling by your principal,  even though it's not the family that was  huffing pottery glaze in the art room  and desk wetting in history class.  Oh, the Smith family,  minus a dad.  You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?  Temporarily By order of the school.  Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?  We have never  eaten poop.  Uh, me, neither.  Say, where did my family get off to?  Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong.  Come on in.  I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?  He got wrapped up in an experiment.  He's a scientist.  Like, legit, like on a an intergalactic,  scifi level. His work is very  He turned himself into a pickle.  Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry.  I suppose that's a good segue  into our little discipline cases here.  Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?  What?! No! What kind of question is that?  The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.  Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these.  No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before.  He's unpredictable and eccentric.  The whole family is. Speaking of which  Okay, let's open things up to the whole family,  and let me ask this.  Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?  Wow. Ugh!  Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine.  The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back  to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them.  You are one driven rat.  Could you be a little more driven?  To the right.  Yes, yes, yes!  Come on, come on, come on! Fresh, fresh, fresh!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend?  Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb rat.    Oh, yeah!  Aaaah!  I didn't say my father is perfect,  I said his work is important.  And she's saying what's important is  that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.  Oh, he did not!  Let's do an experiment here.  I get the impression this family values science.  So raise your hand if you feel certain  you know what was in the syringe.  Raise your hand if you know for certain  the syringe does not contain antipickle serum.  Beth, your hand did a little thing there.  Do you really not see what's happening here?  Tell me. Well, Dr. Wong  By the way, racist name  Obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your  arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run  around what was supposed to be their therapy.  Oh, I think this pickle incident  is a better path than any other  to the heart of your family's dysfunction.  I think it's possible that you and your father  have a very specific dynamic.  I don't think it's one  that rewards emotion or vulnerability.  I think it may punish them.  I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage,  and is infecting your kids with a tendency  to misdirect their feelings.  [Bleep] you.   Mom!  Mom!  [Bleep] both of you, too.  By the way, you might notice that in spite of  your numerous distinctive features,  I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.  That's because, to me, you aren't special.  You were special to rats. Now they're dead.  I guess it was me you should have impressed.  God damn it, I love myself.  Pickle Rick!  Get that parkour.  Get that parkour!  Hey, it's cool.  Just need to find the nearest exit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out.  Whoa!  Who in the [bleep] toilet is this?  What is it?  A pickle? A rat? Both.  It says it's a scientist.  Where is it?  It seems to be using the air ducts  and the mail tubes to get around.  It's been gathering office supplies, we think,  to build weaponry.  But look what it did on the mezzanine.  It transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin.  Whatever this thing is, it's shaming us.  We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?  32 armed guards.  He killed two.  It's on the phone.  Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.  Hello.  Hi, um, can you, uh, please let me out.  Your mere presence in this building  violates international law.  I couldn't let you out even if you hadn't killed two men.  You should know those men killed themselves.  And how is that?  They didn't let me out.  Solen'ya.  Shut your mouth and do your jobs,  you [bleep] children!  Uh, is this not a good time or?  Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"  The Pickle Man, an old wives tale.  He crawls from bowls of cold soup  to steal the dreams of wasteful children.  That'd be a lucky break for you.  Go, shoot to kill.  Aaah!  We got him.   Ah.  Ah.  Because this pickle  doesn't care about your children.  And I'm not gonna take their dreams.  I'm gonna take their parents.  Solen'ya! He's coming!  It's because I threw halfway my sandwich!  He's just a pickle!  He's a monster.  He's not the only one.  You can stay, dead to the world and die in this room.  Or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom.  There is no freedom while you're leader breathes.  Our country is a prison.  Then Catarina is a prisoner.  Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well.  She lives, Jaguar.  Where is this pickle?  What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?  You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.   Antipickle serum.  It's antipickle serum.  Your kids think it might be antipickle serum.  My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.  They're just angry at me for divorcing their father.  I never said I was angry at you.  That's the point of potteryenamel huffing, Summer.  You do it so you don't have to say  "I'm angry at mommy" out loud.  Oh, my God! Oh, there  There's pictures of people eating poop in there!  It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment.  Do you think when your father asks for that syringe,  you could ask him He won't have to ask for it, okay?  He won't need it.  He'll just make more.  He doesn't need anything from anyone.  You admire him for that.  It's better than making your problems  other people's problems.  Oh, come on!  Pickle Man, you should know this isn't personal!  You should know that isn't original.  They have my daughter.  There's nothing I won't do to see her again.  Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter,  but killing you gets me to her quicker  than your derivative bullshit.  I never bullshit, Pickle Man.  This can only end with one of us dead,  and I have never died.  That will be your downfall, Jaguar,  not being open to new experiences.  Is it done?  Jaguar?!  Jaguar couldn't make it.  Do it.  Okay, you win, Pickle Man.  I'm unsealing the building.  No, thanks. I'm coming for you now.  Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds  in a safe on level two.  I'll give you the combination.  That money belongs to the people.  Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick!  Do we have a deal?!  Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter  when you set her free.  Or I'll be visiting you.  Jaguar's daughter is dead.  Huh, so you're a liar.  Jaguar was an animal.  You're an intelligent pickle.  We can do business.  I don't think so. See you soon.   Is the helicopter here?  Yes.  And the police are on the way.  What do we tell them?  Ooh! Aah!  Tell them we were robbed.  Hey! Hey, what are you doing?!  I'm right here!    Farewell, Solen'ya.  F15s are scrambled.  This helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes.  Well, my daughter is about five away,  and I've got about eight to live.  Pickle Man, it's too late for me to tell my daughter  I love her, but not for you.  Oh, well, uh, she knows.  I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap,  to the extent that love is an expression  of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines  precludes the necessity of attachment.  In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters  in an alternate version of earth  that was taken over by mutants.  Okay. Good luck with that.  Wait. Do I have infinite daughters?  Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that.  Nope, just me.  Yeesh!  I  am  afraid  that my kids will get expelled.  Good. Summer, you go.  I am mad  that I can't huff enamel  without people assuming it's because my family sucks.  I hope to be seen one day  as someone that just likes getting high.  Good job.  Morty, do you have an "I" statement?  I am sad  that I peed.  I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.  Look at this family go. You guys are pros.  What do you guys think about doing this once a week?  Ugh.  You must be Rick. Mmhmm.  I've heard a lot about you today.  Your family is crazy about you.  Your daughter holds you in very high regard.  You're a lucky fella.  Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still  happen to have that syringe in your purse?  Dad  I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.  It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive.  I have had a rough day.  And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage.  I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.  By changing you from a pickle to a human.  Yes.  Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?  So I wouldn't have to come here.  Why didn't you want to come here?  Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist.  Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy  for a living, and when I don't like something  about the world, I change it.  And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall  to listen to some agent of averageness  explain which words mean which feelings  has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable  and stop panicking, which is a state of mind  we value in the animals we eat,  but not something I want for myself.  I'm not a cow.  I'm a pickle When I feel like it.  So you asked.  Rick, the only connection between  your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness  destroying your family is that everyone in your family,  you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind  as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.  And I think it's because the only  truly unapproachable concept for you  is that it's your mind within your control.  You chose to come here, you chose to talk  to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe,  and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces.  Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless  by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth  and wipe my ass.  Because the thing about repairing,  maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure.  There's no way to do it so wrong you might die.  It's just work.  And the bottom line is,  some people are okay going to work, and some people  well, some people would rather die.  Each of us gets to choose.  That's our time.  I'm going to give you guys my card  and hope to hear from you again.  And if you have any friends or family that eat poop  and would like to stop, give them my number.  I, um  I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing.  I I shouldn't lie to you.  Oh, it's fine.  I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't.  But I hope you know that's not what  that session was supposed to be.  Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants  and Summer snorting glue or whatever  She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.  Well, there was so much more at stake.  I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.  Are we gonna go back?  Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?  Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse.  Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony.  Eh.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.  Weird breed.  Man, I missed having hands  and blood and a stomach.  We should get a drink.  Really? Like, go somewhere?  Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.  Absolutely.  I I liked her.  So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern?  Maybe Shoney's?  Yeah, either one. Either one.    You'll never get away with this, Concerto.  That is where you're mistaken, Mr. Sanchez.  This shall be my greatest performance of all time!  This is it, Morty. We're goners.  We're not getting out of this one.  After everything we've been through,  this is how we're gonna die.  Make peace with your god.  Oh, geez, Rick, III don't want to die!  And now for the Esplat!  Jaguar!  Who? Who was that, Rick?  That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.
Don't let any of those things get away, Morty.  It their DNA gets into Earth's food chain,  our entire species could be sterilized.  Then why aren't we killing them?  Right, next time I need a species sterilized,  who's gonna do it for me, you?  Whoa! Rick!  IIs that the Vindibeacon?  We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!  I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty.  Let it go to voice mail. Rick,  the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake.  They're the first line of defense against evil.  They're the guardians of the unguarded!  They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty.  They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking  and 20 minutes jumping around while shit blows up.  They're a phase.  We did one, it was the big even of that summer, let it die.  I, Morty Smith, invoke my right  to choose one in every 10 Rick and Morty adventures.  God damn it! Read 'em and weep.  Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.  Yes! Vindicator Command Ship Beacon received.  We're doing Vindicators Twoooooo!  Whoops.  Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.  Supernova: Vindicators.  Worldender is back,  and this time he's out to end more than worlds.  We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on  My balls. Rick!  The Terraneous system.  Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity  which should lead us to the location of the base.  Oh, that's Million Ants.  I can't see the ants from over here,  I just assumed that was, uh, turd man,  wiggly turd man.  Rick, stop! Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?  Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes  Um, this guy, the, uh the, uh  I am Crocubot.  Right, Crocubot.  So, you're half cold, unfeeling reptile, half  also cold  equally unfeeling machine. Yes.  Wow. So, your origin is what?  YYou fell into a vat of redundancy?  Got damn!  Noob Noob, we're having a briefing.  If I can continue, Rick.  I anticipate sophisticated security measures.  I trust you can be of service there.  Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses.  Ability to do anything But only whenever I want  Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.  I wish he had the ability to check his attitude.  Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen.  After his parents tragic death in a railroad accident,  he gained the power to summon ghost trains.  It's not all bad though,  they were spared having to see their grown son wear a WHISTLE.  Got damn!  Thanks, Noob Noob. This guy gets it.  Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier  Sorry I'm late. It was happy hour.  Happy hour.  Uh, I was also late because of my drinking  and mentioned it to zero applause.  Rick Sanchez. Tinkerer of Terror.  Man, that's hard to say.  And Morty, right?  Whoa, yeah! I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators, let's make this three for three?   Haha!  Yes!  Did he say "three for three"?  Did he say he never forgets a kid?  You mean two for two, right, Vance?  Actually, we assembled a second time last summer  to fight Doomnomitron.  So this is Vindicators Three?  And you guys did Vindicators Two without us?  I sense insecurity.  Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby?  I guess he found his crowd.  Pretty toothless stuff, guys.  I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty.  These guys are even lamer than last time.  We weren't here last time, remember?  They did a whole Vindicators without us.  A bunch of them got killed, too.  They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde  Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.  This article says the reason we weren't involved was  "personality conflicts."  Don't worry, Morty, they love you.  Superheroes need a wideeyed unremarkable  to tag along and react to everything  like it's mind blowing.  I think the personality conflict might have been  you?  Jesus  How awesome is that?  I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad  they murdered three innocent heroes of color  and they still had to bring me back?  Rick, since it's my adventure and all,  could you do me a favor?  Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty.  Me sleeping on these linens is the favor.  I mean, wwwhat what are we vindicating? Comfort?  Rick, this really bums me out.  ItIt's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.  Why? Morty I defeat gagoos  more powerful than these guys every week.  Yeah, but not heroes.  Oh, please, they just call themselves heroes so they can  I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes. Mine!  Huh, no accounting for taste.  I'm gonna go get a drink.  PA System: Good morning, Vindicators.  Ship has arrived at Terraneous system.  All Vindicators report to the briefing room.  The The room from the, uh the  Uh, it's the d It's a different room than  Than conference room.  I'm sorry, it's my first day as a PA System.  Firstday jitters.  Oh, God.  Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night.  Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez  to a more comfortable spot so that someone can  clean up his diarrhea.  Oooh, I'm nervous about my first mission!  Actually, Noob Noob, you have a new mission.  Got damn. Vindicators, prepare for arrival.  Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning,  and I'm afraid we need to make a little change.  II totally get it. II'm so sorry.  You should be.  Running around in a yellow Tshirt  like you're not one of us.  Disgraceful. III'm not a superhero.  Cop a squat, chief.  Everyone in the universe is a hero.  All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad,  and root for good.  Rick says good and bad are artificial constructs.  Yeah, well, I get the feeling  He kind of needs that to be the case.  Not coming, Noob Noob?  Ohh! No, uh, I got stuff to do here.  Vance: Security drones, inbound.  Star Mother, grant me your wrath.  All aboard!  Gun turret. Are you all right?  Yes. I only lost 400 ants.  My queen is laying more.  I am back to one Million Ants.  Someone wake up Sanchez.  Ugh! Oh, Christ.  Rick. You're up. Barely.  We're taking fire from an automated turret.  Can you bring it offline? Uhhuh.  Uh, my God, that's better. Rick!  Hey, I can't help if I can't see.  I could've just used a ghost train.  Really? You don't say. You would've used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy  would have used a ghost train.   Man, you.  Is there coffee?  Hey, Morty, can you be a pal,  Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship,  you know, the French press thing  Get it yourself.  Little extra snippy this morning, aren't you?  Just focus on the mission, all right?  Ohohoh, I'm sorry, oh, you're right.  Ohh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?  Son of a Steam Engine. They're all dead.  Why would Worldender do this to his own men  and several women? Well, he is the Worldender.  The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing.   Ohh, real scared.  Real on alert,  high alert over here.  Watch out!  What the?!  It's Worldender! What happened to him?  I sense his life force is fading.  Million Ants, ladies and gentlemen.  The ant colony with the power of two human eyes.  All right. Short mission. Good mission.  Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train?  See you guys in Vindicators Four. Morty? Rick, whoever did this  is an even bigger threat than Worldender.  We can't leave now.  He's right. This is far from over.  Well, have fun with that,  but Morty and I have to meet a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,  Two Assholes, and a Full Alligator in like an hour.  Shit.  I sense the presence  of a greater evil.  Drunk Check, check. One, two.  Okay. Is it recording? Good.  Hello, Vindicators.  Welcome to your reckoning, baby!  Official.  I had too much to drink last night.  You're, you know, the Vindicators.  So, now that we know Rick? What's going on, buddy?  Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.  "Obviously?"  You came here and defeated our arch nemesis  while so drunk you don't remember doing it?  That's something "obvious" to you?  Look, I'm a lit little more complex than you guys,  and, no offense, but I've always suspected  that a lot of what you do in a year  could be knocked out in a couple of hours.  So I thought, why not just do your job for you,  so we can have a little fun game.  Rick, is Is this a "Saw" thing?  Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators?  Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack.  If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave,  you will die.   Well, III think we've seen enough,  I'll just figure out how to unplug this.  Okay, here we go. Room number one.  The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy,  but do they know yourselves, do you know yourselves?  Match your your shit, your your gimmicks,  with your faces, and yyou get it, it's a matching thing.  And do it in three minutes or you'll all die.  Screw this. I'm not playing his game.  I'm gonna find us a way out of here.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance.  He said you'd die if you tried to leave.  That means there's booby traps.  Why are you acting like that's not you?  What part of "blackout" don't you understand?  I thought you drank.  Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking,  not this psycho, trailerpark shit!  Vance, stay calm  Oh, so you're the leader now, because we gave you a jacket?  You're the learningdisabled kid we do photo ops with.  Okay, ouch, but Okay, this  This is triggering me. I need space.  II need space from this!  Give me one reason  why I shouldn't crush your windpipe.  Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh  And because, like I said, I don't remember last night.  I told you not to invite this mummified mother back.  Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here,  but if you keep coming at me,  there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.  Guys! I figured it out.   Congrats!  You did it it!  It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you.  Drunk Rick's point  is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.  Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.  Then we'll deal with the two of you.  The two of us? I hope you're proud of yourself.  Uh, I kind of am. I saved the God damn universe.  That's not the issue, Rick!  Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't!  The Vindicators say their job  is to fight evil wherever it hides,  but they don't Pick the location you'll  You'll never hear them even mention,  because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.  Oh! I know this. Dorian 5!  Crocubot, don't!  There's no other possible answer.  My mechanical and reptilian logic are certain of it.  Oh!  Huh! I'm seeing more croc than bot here.  God damn it!  Uh, what happened on Dorian 5? Nothing!  Nothing? We exterminated a planet.  WWait. Huh?  Doomnomitron was hiding there! He's a shapeshifter.  Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him.  Come on, guys, we're all thinking it.  Don't  Don't make me say it.  Oh, okay. This again.  You know, I could have made you a device  to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like that.  I'm not the one that didn't want you back. Alan was.  If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time  Do not threaten her.  Congrats, you did it.  What the hell is "Israel"?  ItIt's just something Rick starts talking about  when he's blackout drunk.  WWhat? In w In wwwhat?  Like, wwwhat's my point?  In a way that has no point,  you just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations  and then you pass out.  So, to be clear, I sometimes reference  the geopolitical complexities of the topic  Which is not the same as going to an antiSemitic place.  I have not stake in this  I don't either, I'm I'm just saying, if anything,  the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel  he wants what's best for it and  Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you.  Aloha means hello and goodbye in Hawaii.  But, uh, aloha means  Has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so drunk.  Ugh, okay. Here's the deal.  II want to rest my eyes for a little bit,  I'm I'm not going to sleep,  I just just need to rest my eyes,  so let's make this one simple  Just try to hit some three pointers.  Let's say you have to hit five three pointers  in five minutes or I don't know,  the whole place the whole planet will get blown up  with a nneutrino bomb.  And try to make it aa lesson about yourselves,  like like how selfish you are  Are or something.  And also Hawaii.  You guys hit the baskets,  I'll disarm the drunkenlyimprovised neutrino bomb.  There's a 40 percent chance it's a dud,  but yyou should still stay back.  Morty, how many of these  Too many, Rick! Too many!  Man, I am really getting highroaded today.  That's a three pointer.  Nice shot. Thank you.  You two make quite a team.  We all do.  Yeah, I guess  That's a three pointer.  But you guys have always had a an unspoken bond.  I mean, really unspoken.  Like, let'snottellmyhusband unspoken.  We aren't married anymore, Alan.  Sure, but were we married  when you two were "stranded" on Delphi Six for three days?  Because I sensed something was weird when you came back  But what do I know about sensitivity?  I'm just a phantom train conductor.  You're the pile of ordinary bugs that my wife!  That's a three pointer.  Where the is the lead wire?  You always put it in the weirdest place.  Um, uh, over here maybe?  Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb.  It's a miracle I ever actually destroy anything.  Oh, I don't know,  you managed to destroy just about everything today.  The villains, the heroes,  the lines between them, my childhood  I appreciate it, Morty,  I know you were sucking the KoolAid  out of the Vindicators'  So the fact that I was right about them  must be pretty hard to admit.  Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick?  Because when you're an asshole,  it doesn't matter how right you are,  nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.  I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right.  That's why popular people are dumb.  And why your pretentious, poorlywritten,  highbudget friends back there  can eat a doubledecker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.  Holy shit. You're jealous.  Yes! Is that what you want to hear?!  Did it feel good?  Did you like his six million wriggling legs  more than my tragedystricken,  halfghost, halftumescent penis?! Guys, stop!  You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!  You wish this was about sex! We loved each other!  We had a child together! What?!  I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me  because it was half a million ants and half collapsing star!  And yes. He was better than you.  Yeah?  One million times better.  All aboard, mother  Stop!  Oof! Didn't see that coming.  Is that sarcasm?  I don't want you slipping away when this is over.  All of these deaths are on your hands.  Okay, come on, maybe a couple of them,  but definitely not the Train Guy.  Oof! All of them.  Oookay.  Congrats. You did it.  All right, by now, I've been pretty clear  that I think the Vindicators are full of shit.  But you do have one thing that I'll never have.  And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators  with any value to me.  If you know what it is, place it on the platform.  Guess wrong and plaplanet will explode.  And probably the solar system,  'cause I kind of eyeballed the neutrino bombs  on this one.  So what's the trick? Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert.  I think no matter what we put on there, we die.  He said it's the part of the Vindicators he values.  That means nothing.  He wants our last moment alive  to be spent knowing how few he gave.  Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions.  It could It could be Morty.  What? Hey, I don't know.  I mean, look, when I get drunk,  I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it.  It's, like, it's possible I got so drunk  I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators,  and maybe this is my way of saying, "Okay",  you can have him but only if you know how important he is,  "otherwise I'll kill you."  That is a really specific guess.  Look, II there's nothing in the room but us.  I'm just using logic to connect some dots,  it's the best guess I've got.  But you're betting our lives on it.  I'll cover that bet. I get it.  Well, Morty, I think you're doing that smirky face  because you're misinterpreting the moment.  I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.  I want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess,  like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or  Phew.  Oh, shit.  Sorry. I'm not good at goodbyes,  and I'm drunk, so, you know, I just  It looks like I'm never going to see you again.  I can't really roll with the hero types.  And I don't they They don't want me around.  But I want you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time,  I really appreciated you sticking by me.  God damn it, why am I crying? It makes no sense.  Ugh, you're You're probably confused  because we barely knew each other,  but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes  in the briefing room.  Everybody else had their head so far up their ass.  Even my own grandson is like,  "Oh, the Vindicators, they're so cool."  I mean, he's a moron, that's their demographic.  But you're different, Noob Noob.  Mother  You're cool. And you're smart.  And I bet we coulda hung out and shit.  And I hope you get to be a fullfledged Vindicator  and and do Do me a favor,  don't don't let them know II got emotional.  But you can tell them one thing.  Tell them I said  Oh Okay. I just shit myself. Okay, later.  W Dude, Morty, what happened Shut up.  I sense this means we are not dying.  Not all of us.  Sweetheart.  Just let Titty Bean do this, Snuzzles.  It's for the greater good.  Greater good? Titty Bean?  It's like you said, Morty.  There's no right or wrong Never said that.  It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators  that keeps the galaxy secure.  Yeah, I feel safer already.  No doubt, who do we make the check out to?  I will say we are getting some good licks in  while choking to death Right?  Titty Bean. Listen to me.  When you came to me,  I was merely a sentient colony of ants.  It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice  that taught me to be a man.  When did it get so complicated?  Who knows. But we can make it simple again.  You were always the romantic.  Which is why you can't leave, either.  I'm sorry, my love.  Damn! She doublecrossed Snuzzles!  Silence! I'm going to enjoy this  Announcer: Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez  for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together,  and for booking one of the hottest talents out there  Logic! Logic: Awe, yeah.  Look at that. It's going down.  Geez, I must have planned a whole party.   It's Logic, y'all.  Invited a bunch of people.   Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.  Shout out to my boy, Rick.  Are you ready?  Rick, Supernova's getting away. Eh, who cares?  But she was trying to kill us.  Morty, 20 people try to kill me every week.  I end up getting high with half of them.  I mean, check it out, Gearhead's here.  Hmm. Well, that's gonna shoot through me.  Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket.  Are you a little superhero now?  Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom.  Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators.  Don't mind if I do.  Hey, everybody! Look who's a Vindicator!  Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced. Shut up, Summer.  Yo, it's Logic once again, y'all.  Don't forget the name.  Make sure you get home safe.  And, man, we gotta all give it up for Rick,  'cause, I mean, what kind of mother  Just sets up a whole festival like this  when he's completely loaded, man?  And all that stuff I said about Vance, that's not real.  Vance that guy, that guy sucks  Whoo!  Yeah!  Yo  DDid I get paid yet? Whoo!  I can't believe we're getting Gear Cream with a Vindicator.  So, you girls in Gear college or Gear  Alien terror attack!  Okay. Sounds like a job for me.  I better go get into my alter ego.  So cool. I know.  Wait, what alter ego?  He was already wearing the jacket.  Gotta know when to hold 'em and  Aaaaah!  Did you get any of that?
Jerry! Jerry, come on!  We got to go! You got to come with me, Jerry!  Rick? It's important, Jerry.  The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders.  Let's go. Put some pants on.  NNever mind, there's no time for pants, Jerry.  I'll make you a pair of pants on the way.  It's a Rick and Jerry adventure!  Rick and Jerry episode!  Then I thought, "Hey, what about Jerry?  He's He's good with regular folk."  This is a real situation where where  Where Jerry could really shine.  "He's a master convincer."  Rick, I'm not an idiot. I know what this is.  Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty,  "Look, parents get divorced. They get sad. He'll be fine,"  but I think he's worried you're gonna, you know Pbht!  And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional.  It impedes my work.  So, I told him I'd take you out and give you a win.  Wait. My son asked you to take me  on some kind of pity adventure  to keep me from killing myself?  Wait, wwhat did you think it was?  An execution.  Geez! You really do need a win.  No! II don't know.  I mean, you never made me the pants, so  So, you thought I was gonna drive you  into the middle of the galaxy  and shove you into the vacuum of space  with your dick hanging out?  And we're seeing how you'd act  if that were about to happen?  I mean I'll make you the pants right now.  Take me two seconds to make you pants.  I have pants at home! Jerry, if I make pants,  they'll be better than your pants at home.  Also, if I wanted to kill you  Yeah, I get it. It would be amazing.  Please, take me home.  I'll tell my son we had an amazing adventure.  Well, if it's all the same,  could we go get our story straight?  Because you're a terrible liar.  You called me a master convincer!  You believed me?  Huh. This seems kind of fancy.  Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent  of an alien truck stop.  You have no frame of reference.  You're in a universe beyond your imagining.  But, yes, it is super fancy.  I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy.  I'm not gonna take you somewhere dangerous.  Rick Sanchez.  I told you if I ever saw your face in here again,  I would stick you like the pig you are.  Shnoopy Bloopers, I told you if you tried  There'd be two funerals.  Aaah!!  Someone?  Uh, someone? Someone!  My friend! It has been too long.  Oh, it's great to see you again, buddy!  Yeah, you're doing it.  Mr. Sanchez gets anything he wants!  The resort's covered in an immortality field.  You can't die here. That's the gimmick.  Okay, but still Bad parenting.  Hey, rich aholes are rich aholes.  They all pay top dollar to come here  and enjoy a consequencefree vacation.  No death, no disease, no dismemberment.  Can't even have a heart attack.  Got it. The perfect place  to take the most fragile being in the universe.  I can tell you expect me to refute that,  but it's right on the money.  If I come home without you,  I doubt Morty's gonna let me off the hook.  Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum?  What the are you talking about, Jerry?  Jesus!  Holy shit!  Yo, what's up, "Big Chill"?!  Don't go into the telepod!  Hey, maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure.  On a fake adventure.  Speaking of What are we gonna tell Morty?  I don't know. But whatever it is,  we're gonna need a couple more of these babies!  What's wrong?  Mom, do you think I'm hot?  I don't think that's something that matters.  So, I'm not hot?!  I'm saying the part of you that cares about that  is a part you shouldn't give any energy to.  That's not an answer!  Because I'm not an issue of Cosmo, okay?  I'm your mother and a doctor, and  I'm hideous!  Geez. What's with her?  Teenagegirl stuff.  Is that a hoof collage?  It's perfectly legal, if that's what you're wondering.  Cool zies.  "We just don't have anything in common any more, Summer."  Oh, yeah, Ethan?  What do you have in common with Tricia Lange?  A mutual love of French cinema?  The belief that a carbon tax  is the only viable solution to climate change?  Or could it be her massive stripper titties?!  There it is.  Boobya!  And that's when Malakai the Squid came,  rips off his face, and beneath it is my face.  I liked it. Thank you, sir.  Yeah, of course he likes it. Look at him.  Mother got two heads and three trunks.  All right, we'll put a pin in it.  I'm gonna go take a leak.  What the?!  My hands are dry! My hands are dry!  My name is Risotto Groupon.  I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant.  Do you have any comment cards,  because I might have some thoughts.  My kingdom was usurped by force  with weapons and technology  supplied by your fatherinlaw!  Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man.  He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family.  Then we are brothers, and you have wondered  what your life could have been without Rick.  Wondered? Sure.  I mean, I've wondered about having a vagina.  Would you help me kill him?  What? No!  He's my wife's father. Move on.  Do you like themepark rides?  Oh, you really moved on.  There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly.  Between the first whirly and the third dirly,  the ride dips just outside the immortality field.  You're asking me to lure Rick to his death?  I'm only asking you to go on a ride with Rick,  get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family,  where you can wonder about having a vagina.  Okay, okay, that was a very specific example  pulled from thin air.  I don't want to be known as the vagina guy.  Risotto, you're needed. Someone ordered  the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh and Fluzzy Special.  Look, I'm not like Rick,  so you're free to do as you please.  But there comes a time in every man's life  when he must choose the foundation  on which his legacy will be built  One of compromise or one of blood.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oops! Okay, a little more on the other side then.  Oh, come on!  Oh, geez!  Aah! Stop!  So, the hospital just let you walk right out of there  with horse parts in a bag?  For Christ's sakes, Morty,  women going through a divorce  need a creative outlet.  What was that?  Summer!  I'm coming, Summer!  What the hell happened?!  How do we get her back to normal?!  I don't know, man! This thing is pretty complicated.  II'm gonna call Rick.  Well, hold on. We can't just call your grandpa  whenever there's a problem.  We can handle this ourselves.  I mean, I don't see the point in trying to.  This is obviously Ricklevel  I have a medical degree.  Is that what this is about?  LLike, you want to prove yourself?  Oh, it's not about anything, Morty. How dare you?  Okay, good. Then I'll just call Ow!  Morty, I need this.  Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here says he knows a place  where the ladies drop panties for anyone bipedal.  Yeah, I'm not really interested.  My heart still belongs to Beth.  Oh. Huh. Okay.  What, you don't think I have a shot?  I didn't say that.  Excuse me. May I have another one of these?  Coming right up.  Hmm, things weren't always so bad between Beth and me.  We had some good times when we were younger.  Oh, yeah, I bet.  That's how teenage pregnancy happens, my friend.  Yeah, no.  Things were pretty great, even until a couple of years ago.  Jerry, I get it.  That's around the time I moved in with you guys.  Oh, I guess you're right.  Jerry, you know, I hope you're not suggesting  that I had anything to do with your marriage breaking up,  because there are some major issues between you and Beth  that have been there since you guys met.  Hey, to new beginnings.  To the Whirly Dirly.  The Whirly Dirly?  All right, what's going on here?  When did you get cool?!  When you stole my wife!  I should have done that a long time ago!  We're going on the Whirly Dirly!  Whirly Dirly, baby.  Aha, look at this.  It says "normalize."  I bet if we just press that  But if the machine was made by spider people,  normal would mean eight legs.  Oh, God! Are you gonna go on another spiel  like you did with the fleshcolored crayon?  I'm pretty sure "normalize" will make her normal.  Aah!  I'd call that progress.  She's huge! And normal!  I'm not normal!  Mom!  Okay, this says "reverse." Done and done.  I don't think that's a good idea.  Oh, come on! What else could "reverse" possibly mean?  Aah!  Mom, call Rick!  Thank you.  There's a customerservice number on here.  Mom!  Oh, man. This is gonna be awesome!  I got to hand it to you, Jerry. This was a solid idea.  Uh, yeah. Uhhuh.  And you know what? I'll cop to it.  I put a lot of strain on your marriage.  It wasn't fair. I'm sorry.  What?! I didn't respect your marriage.  I certainly didn't do it any favors.  And for what it's worth,  I'll apologize to Beth for it when we get home.  Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!  Stop the ride! We got to get off.  What are you talking about, buddy?  We got to get out of this thing. We got to get out!  Jerry, come on, man!  We haven't even gotten to the first whirly.  No, no, this sucks. It's so boring.  I mean, I'm falling asleep here.  Let's just get out and crawl down the sides.  Uh, get down! Duck down!  It's more fun when you scrunch down.  Jerry, what the  Oh  Rick, up here! There's a spot where you can kill him!  Good call, Jerry!  Hey, how'd you know about that?  Uh  Lisa?  So, uh, Jerry, big fan of the Whirly Dirly, are you?  Not anymore. Obviously.  But when you were, how did you know about it?  We had a deal, Jerry Smith.  It's a really common name.  Now, take it easy, Rick.  You've been in a serious rollercoaster crash.  It's It's no time to be thinking about  who did or didn't play a role in your attempted murder.  Get it off me!  It's eating me!  Look, I confess, okay?  They told me about all the bad stuff you did to this planet  and reminded me of all the bad stuff you did to me.  But then you said you were sorry, and I realized  you're not a monster Not like this thing.  It's got me good.  This is a mislead, right?  You're inventing a thing to save me.  That would be called a knife, Jerry.  It's been invented.  I'm making a way out of here One seat ought to do it.  I'm sorry. II made a mistake.  I won't do it again! Nobody ever does.  You selfrighteous piece of  You took my family!  I took your family?  Who do you think had more taken from them  when you shot 20 ccs  of liquid dreamkiller into my daughter?  She was Rick's daughter, Jerry. She had options!  Oof.  That all ended because she felt sorry for you.  You act like prey, but you're a predator!  You use pity to lure in your victims!  That's how you survive!  I survive because I know everything.  That snakes survives because children wander off,  and you survive because people think,  "Oh, this poor piece of. He never gets a break."  I can't stand the deafening silent wails  of his wilting soul.  "I guess I'll hire him or marry him."   Rick!  Rick!  I knew you wouldn't let me die.  That was never an option.  Because you never had a son.  No, because I need a living organism  coated in gibble snake bile to attract a shmooglite runner.  Wait, what's happening? Use that confusion, Jerry.  It'll make you wriggle more like an abandoned newborn.  Jesus Christ!  What the Rick?!  Help! Help me!  Aaah!  There's a space port 20 miles south.  We'll be able to board a galaxy class cruise ship  and jump through a wormhole that will put us  within spitting distance of the Milky Way.  But, hey, it's about the journey,  not the destination, right, Jerry?  Just stay put, sweetie! Mom's still on hold.  Morphizer customer service. How may I help you?  Yes, I'm having a little trouble with one of your machines.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.  Do you see a little compartment on the side of the machine?  Let me check. Yes, got it.  Mom?  Great! Now, do you see the little button next to it?  I do. Give that button a push.  Okay. Mom, listen to me!  We're free!!  Okay, so I pushed the button, and three little men ran out.  What do I do next?  Hello?  I think we got disconnected.  Morty!  Don't "Morty" me!  I tricked Rick into taking Dad on an adventure  because I thought I could get a break  from this kind of but no!  Like father, like damn daughter!  You want to be like Rick, congratulations!  You're just as arrogant and just as irresponsible!  Everything okay here?  Mind your own damn business, Gene!  I'm having a conversation with my mother here!  Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna help him keep him around,  Mom, but it will help you lose everyone else.  Like I lost Summer.  Hey, you haven't lost her yet.  No, I definitely did. She's gone.  God damn it!  Go ahead.  Oh, come on. What's happening?  Your friend is class C or above cybernetic augmentations.  Emphasis on the above.  In any case, he needs to be neutralized.  What?! Wait!  Ugh!  Brain hurty.  What did you do?  It's a synaptic dampener that blocks violent tendencies  and controversial thought.  He will now be an ideal passenger.  I want cookies and a 90minute cut of "Avatar."  Seriously?  Quit it. It'll wear off in six hours.  It's cheaper than banning dangerous people from flights.  I mean, let everybody buy a ticket, right?  Otherwise, the terrorists win.  Aah!  I'm sorry I'm not a classic maternal archetype.  Okay, I don't know what to do when you people come to me  with your weird puberty issues.  What are you gonna do when your daughter asks you  if she's attractive?  I'll say "yes"! Morty, gross!  Well, she's gonna be super hot.  Her mother's gonna be Jessica  Wait, when did Summer ask you that?!  Right before she Clive Barkered herself. Why?  Wait, I know where she is!  Ethan and Summer were supposed to go camping,  and then he dumped Summer for this girl, Tricia Lange,  who's got huge boobies and took her.  Campsite The one with the name that sounds like somebody  gave up halfway through naming it.  Uh Camp Flabanabba!  Mama's coming, baby.  Mama's coming, and she cares about your titties!  They have sweet smiggle honey cookies.  Mmm! And lowcalorie petroleum flakes.  Obviously cookies.  Let's get you the flakes then.  Okay, but it's not what I wanted.  Well, maybe next time, you won't be  such a dumb piece of and you can pick for yourself.  That's not nice. What's that?  Did you just have a controversial thought?  No. That's what I thought, bitch.  You little punkass.  This is the best.  I agree. You've made things even easier  than if you hadn't been incompetent.  Uhoh. We get shootshoot now.  we're about to enter the wormhole.  So, I hope everybody bought a dinner first.  Nice. Nice.  Jerry, step over there  and lock yourself in the escape pod.  You're not killing us? I'm killing Rick.  You're free to go.

I feel like our souls were united,  and we were all one with eternity.  Our body's unchanged,  yet our minds have lived a thousand lifetimes.  Is that enough time for me to forgive you?  I don't know, but it's enough time  for a synaptic dampener to wear off.  He hadn't decided he was still going to kill us!  He was talking himself into it. I've seen it before.  Cosmic apotheosis wears off faster than salvia.  I'm starting to believe you because I just finished merging  with your essence for an endless epoch,  and I'm already back to thinking you're an asshole.  Fine with me. Let's just go our separate ways.  Sounds like you and the word "epoch"  have a lot of catching up to do.  Wait, don't leave me!  and walk around the cabin  and maybe take the wormhole out for breakfast.  but not both.  You think you got that thing figured out?  Yeah, I know what I'm doing.  Good. Because I have an idea.  It's actually a contraction of "some" and "more,"  you see that? Oh, wow.  I was way off.  Morty, what's happening here?  Summer got into my grandpa's garage,  messed around, and turned herself into a monster.  My mom did the same to make her feel better.  She's a good mom.  Oh, my God. I have to go call my mother!  Tricia, wait! Ethan!

Okay, Rick, come on. Enough.  Man, did you hear me bite that guy's head off?  Geez, I really need to chill.  Maybe you should go through twice.  All right, mister comedy man, you don't have to bust my balls. You're not helping things.  Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this  Morty!   RiRick  Morty!  What happened?  We blew up, idiot! Are you really that stupid?  Obviously the guy I yelled at overloaded the machine.  It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty, mother[bleep]!  But this might do it.  Run, Morty! EEverything hurts!  That's because you're worthless!  Jesus, how big was this explosion?  I'm a genius. I don't have time for this [bleep].  WWWe're in Hell, aren't we, Rick?   You're so stupid, Morty.  You're an idiot.  There's no such thing as Hell.  I believe you, but I just want to die.  You can die when I say so. I control you.  I control the universe! Why am I bragging about that?  I have nothing to prove.  I'm surrounded by inferior pieces of [bleep] and  Toxins.  We're not in Hell, Morty. We're in the detoxifier.  The machine didn't blow up. It worked normally.  It removed our toxins.  We're the toxins.  Are you listening,  you stupid little garbage person?!  We're what got removed!!  I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing.  Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat?  It's all good.  It's nice of you to let me off the hook.  It's still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it.  Believe me, man, I've been working here a long time.  I get it.  Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music?  Not at all.  Grab my terrifolds   What is that? I just hit shuffle.  Are you kidding?   This universe.  Oh, excuse me.  We should listen to one random song a day, you know?  We'd end up hearing more songs we didn't like,  but we'd discover a lot more that we did.  That is an interesting concept.  You know, it makes me wonder  if there's an algorithmic expression  that could achieve the ideal ratio.  Listen to me  Trying to calculate happiness over here.  Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.  Hey, here's something no science could measure  I'm real proud to be your grandpa, Morty.  Thanks, Rick. I love you.  Yeah, mother[bleep]! Yeah! Get it! Get some!  Right up your [bleep] bitch ass, you [bleep]!  Guess who just discovered a new element?!  You think you could do that, Morty?  You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years?  Do you think if God existed he could do it?  The answer is no.  If God exists, it's [bleep] me.  Yes, Rick. II agree, Rick.  While you were flapping your parasitic turd holster,  I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty.  What do you think about that?  Uh I th I think my voice is annoying.  It is, and it's your best quality.  So true.  Now, who can tell me the common denominator  of these two factions?  You don't know or y'all just bored?  Hey, listen, you know, wha If we're all bored over here,  wouldn't the common denominator be you?  Damn, Morty. That's hilarious.  Normally I would come down on any kind of disruption,  but it seems to represent a positive change  for your character.  Class dismissed!   Awesome, Morty!  You done good, Morty.  Oh, yeah!  Thanks for the advice, Morty. You got it.  I did it, Morty! I knew you could.  Hey, Morty, remember yesterday  when I couldn't play the trombone?  Well, check this out!  Just like I told you, Mitch  The music was in your heart the whole time.  Stupid hat Wish I had the courage to just be myself.  There you are.  You might have all these idiots fooled,  but I know you're still the same pathetic loser  hiding behind a confident facade.  I know that because  I'm doing the same thing, brother.  I'm not alone anymore!  Hey, Morty. Word around school is you've become super healthy.  I don't know about all that.  I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of  haven't taken you to dinneritis.  Might be fatal.  Hey, kids. Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.  Morty, a moment of your time?  Happy to help, Rick.  I hate to bug you with this,  but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint,  highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone.  Listen.  It's a bad phone. Chuck it.  I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only.  You know, if if if something's worth saying,  Iit's worth eye contact.  Uh, III traced the source of the call  back to the spa we went to, Morty.  I thought I could hear a voice in there,  so I enhanced it, aand listen.  Hey, asshole! Oh, man!  Remember us? Oh, I don't like confrontation!  You [bleep] us, you pieces of garbage!  That's right, you're [bleep] garbage, not us.  I'm a [bleep] genius and a god.  You really think this thing can hold me?  I'm gonna rip your throat  Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities,  their own will to live?  WWhat if mine shares my intelligence  and devised a way to reach out to us?  Sounds like he's in a lot of pain.  Lot. O. Pain.  But, you know, you shouldn't have to deal with that, man.  You know, llet's work off your trauma  with some urban spin yoga.  It's amazing. You do yoga on a bike,  but you have an atrisk preteen  I don't think I can just blow this off, Morty.  If I had known it worked this way, I wouldn't have detoxed.  Well, I would have because I was toxic.  Now I'm detoxed and I'm accountable to my toxins, right?  IIt's a dilemma. I think I know what to do.  Morty! Rick!  You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain  that misses eating all them big fat problems.  Focus on the good thing. Trust me, things are good.  Taking that away from me  that wouldn't be healthy.  Oh, man. World's Greatest Grandpa, for reals.  It's not just a coffee cup for you, bud.  You're legit.  I love drums. I never took drum lessons.  Why? Limitations. We are addicted to our own limitations.  How amazing is that?  Is the kale prepared in the kitchen?  I'll have a water. Uh  How is the "crudite?"  CruditÃ©. It's a cup of carrot sticks.  Ha!

[Bleep] it.  Tink.  Mm!  Let's ask my grandpa. He's a scientist.  Hey, Rick, are you familiar with "benoi" technology?  Morty, great news.  I went back to the spa and they let me purchase  the containment unit from their detoxifier.  Why? Because we're coming home, bitch!  What is this? This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real.  Oh oh, and I think you dropped something, too!  I don't want to be on camera.  I'm ugly and gross, please.  Should I go? You're your own person, Stacy.  Then I'd like to stay.  Rick, please tell me  you're not trying to put that stuff back inside of us.  Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us.  We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can.  Mother[bleep]!  See? They're living in pain.  That's what they do, Rick, they live in pain.  They are pain, you know?  They they're all the bad parts of us, which, by the way,  includes our dishonesty,  so how do you know this isn't all some sort of crazy trick?  Oh, so now because I'm made entirely of toxins I'm also a liar?  [Bleep] you, you little sociopath.  You hear this, Morty? Oh, everybody hates me. I can tell.  YYou all hate me All right, shut up, Morty.  Healthy Rick, are we doing this or what?  Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you to step into the booth.  Don't negotiate with that little turd, dummy.  You're the Rick. You need to show dominance.  Morty, booth, now. Booth!  Come on, Morty. Don't touch me!  Morty, do the healthy thing and voluntarily retoxify yourself.  Nooooo!  Is it wrong if I think this is kind of hot?  Let me out of here! Stacy, help! Open the door!  I need to hear our safe word, Morty.  Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!  What are you doing? I'll do anything for you, Morty.  No!  It worked! Yes! That idiot believed every word.  Now let's see how he enjoys living in that shit tank.  He's right behind me, isn't he?  He's in front of you. Oh. My eyes are still adjusting.  Uh, is this like a sex dungeon?  I guess I should've been paying attention.  After 70 years of being bottled up  inside a sentimental jackass,  I finally get to live my own life.  You said we were merging. I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything!  Why would I ever remerge with a pussy like you?  So you were just gonna trap us in that tank?  TThat was your plan? Not was, mother[bleep] still is.  Kill him, Rick!  I don't like this! This is scary!  All right, you asked for it.  Did I ask for this?  Did I ask for this? Huh? Did I?  Assessing threat to groin.  Groin System 6000. Kill him!  That is my groin's user.  Believe me, I got a lot more use out of that thing  than he ever did.  You know what? Not my table.  You do know me.  What the hell, Grandpa Rick?  [Bleep] you, Summer! Sorry, Summer!  Okay, okay, take it easy. Don't do it.  I love you.

That's it.  How could that detox machine know the difference  between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it?  It can't.  It must be by the individual's own definition of toxicity.  That means  Dad! What the What the hell, Rick?  I'll explain on the way.  This "Moon Tower," Morty,  is the perfect height and metallic composition  for the amplification and beaming of toxic energies.  What do you think about that, Morty?  Are you excited about that, Morty?  Oh, man. I'm just freaked out. IIt's too high up here.  Once I flip this switch,  the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby.  As we praise our loving Father  God is a lie! We made him up for money!  Santa Claus isn't real.  You were all mistakes!  We [bleep] did it, Morty.  Put your [bleep] hands in the air.  Yeah, you little piece of [bleep].  Remember me?  Didn't you learn last time that you can't beat me?  Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else.   This.  Ahh!!  That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus  that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.  You think I give a [bleep]?  I know you give a [bleep], dummy.  Because I know I don't.  Here's another thing I know  The decryption key that neutralizes the virus.  You want it? Come and get it.  Merge with me and you'll know how to save him.  Pfft. Come on, man. I've been trapped  in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions,  but this is the alltime weakest bluff that I've ever  OwOhh!! Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!  He's cutting your time in half. 10 minutes. Ohh! It hurts!  What is your problem?  Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement,  my narcissism, my crippling loneliness,  my irrational attachments.  They must be somewhere. They ain't over here, bro.  I'm not going back in there!  Honestly, I don't care either way.  I hate having you in me.  And when I say "honestly" you can believe it,  because we both know I'm too healthy to lie.  Watch.  All right! Knock it off! You're not impressing anyone.  Morty, not that I give a [bleep], but are you okay?  Jesus Christ, it hurts. Relax, quit your bitching.  YYou're gonna be fine. Grandpa's here.  You think that's funny?  YYou got to have a sense of humor about these things.  Oh, wait, you can't.  You're literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture.  I guess it's just funny because you've never done  anything but complain about me being in charge,  but if I ever gave you the wheel we'd be dead in five minutes.   Rick?  You poor, dumb, sick animal.  Rick?  Ahh! Just do it!  Just do it, you piece of  I'm back, baby! Regular Rick! Master of both worlds!  Check it it out!  "Excuse me."  Now we'll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam.  Man, I really over think shit when I'm angry.  Oh, give it to me.  Mm, mamah.  God is not a lie.  Mommy! Mommy!  Ha! All right, Morty,  now it's time we remerge your little ass.  You're a better man than me, Rick.  I'm healthy enough to admit that!  That kid is a real piece of [bleep].  YYYou're gonna save me, right?  Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty.  Part of me really wanted to.  I'm telling you, these shares are hot. Yeah.  That sounds like a good idea. It's definitely a good idea.  Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me?  Have I ever lied to you?  That's right, and ask around, I never do, Duane.  Let me put this real simple.  This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single,  not looking to date but ready to fall in love,  and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane  Two lockers down.  So step up or step off, Duane.  Blue pill or red pill, what'll be, bro?  Totally understand, Duane.  You're the boss.  Heinholz Biotech  Million and a half at thirtythree.  Heh.  You little [bleep] monster.  Mmm!

You don't have to be a dick.  I think you know that's not true. Geez.  I didn't know there were still Ricks and Mortys  living on the Citadel.  I wonder what their daytoday lives are like.  Well, you can keep wondering that  while we go on a fun, fresh,  selfcontained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid  or one of the unfortunate millions  held hostage by their terrible ideas.  Man, I'm glad I'm not one of them!  Announcer Rick: Citadel Morning News.  News about the Citadel in the morning,  pretty self explanatory.  Good morning. I'm Rick D716B.  And I'm Rick D716. Must be nice.  Coming up, gravity outages in East Sanchez Heights  And, is your uraniumpowered cellular matrix  making you sick?  The answer may not surprise you.  It's Yes, it's uranium.  Those stories and more, after this break.  Sam Elliot: 60 iterations off the central finite curve,  there's a Rick that works more with wood  than polarity plating.  His name is Simple Rick but he's no dummy.  He realized long ago  that the greatest thing he'd ever create  was his daughter.  I love Daddy!  Sam Elliot: We captured that moment  We run it on a loop through Simple Rick's mind  And the chemical it makes his brain secrete  goes into every Simple Rick's "Simple Wafers" Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor  of your own completion.  Come home to Simple Rick's.  Just one day remains  before our newly democratic Citadel  elects its first President,  it's anyone's race among the Rick candidates.  But a certain other candidate  should be getting at least one vote  for most adorable.  That's right.  The Morty party candidate's still in the race,  and you just gotta love him for that.  Here you see him in his little Morty suit waving  Isn't that adorable? Little jackass.  Yeah, I think we actually have  the audio for his speech here  Aw, geez. Aw, man.  I'm gonna lose the election and stuff.  We had a good run, sir,  but I think it's time to pull out of the race.  I feel pretty confident about tonight's debate.  You shouldn't, sir. You should be terrified.  Maybe you should find a little faith, young man.  You don't pay me to have faith.  And we're the same age!   Aah!  Whoa!  Sorry. II was expecting  A Rick partner?  Lesson one, rookie, expect the unexpected.  Now, get in.  Mortys are human!  Get the [Bleep] off the car, you Rickless [Bleep] animal!  Whoa! Morty Cop: The election's got these yellow shirts  more riled up than a pictureday Jessica.  That's pretty harsh, sir.  So report me. Nobody gives a [Bleep]  Look, I'm just saying, it makes me a little sad  to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys animals.  Well, it makes me sad to hear another Rick cop  buying into his sensitivity training.  Well, I'm glad to know there's more like me.  There was one.  Why do you think that seat was empty?  Rick Dispatch: Robbery at Fifth and Avenue.  Fifth and  That's Morty Town. Unit seven responding.  Rick Teacher: Good idea, Rick.  All Morty Students: Good idea, Rick.  This is a great adventure.  All: This is a great adventure.  I love being your new Morty.  All: I love being your new Mor Farty.  Very amusing, Mr. Smith.  Almost as amusing as when your first Rick  was decapitated on Zorpantheon Nine.  Or was that your third Rick?  How many Ricks have you had?  Five. I see.  So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you'll be transferred to your new Ricks.  Hopefully they will be your last.  Yes, Slow Ri Tall Morty?  Di did I gradgitate this time yet?  Anything's possible, Tall Morty.  I guess we won't be seeing each other after this?  I say we make our last day count.  I say we go to the Wishing Portal.  That's a myth. It's not a myth.  My first Rick's fourth Morty  knew a Rick whose Morty went there.  If we're not here for graduation,  our butts are gonna wind up in Morty Town.  I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard,  not a chicken.  Okay, fine. I'm in.  Me too.  What the hell?! I thought I saw a fly.  Supervisor Rick:  Listen up, [Bleep] nuts.  I've been your supervisor for five years,  but all shitty things must come to an end  and I have been promoted to regional manager.  All:  Yeah, I feel the same way, may be never meet again.  Of course,  that makes the position of supervisor available,  so, as of next week, the ass you'll be kissing  will be that of  K83, affectionately known as Cool Rick.  All:  I know I'm new to the Citadel,  and some of you might not think I put in my time,  but what can I say?  I'm Cool Rick!  Yo! Ha! Ha! Check me out!  All right knuckleheads, any questions?  All right, then, back to work, you gold rickers.  No Ricks, no families,  high off their asses, and running amuck.  Mortys are raised to be sidekicks.  Without a side to kick, they just start kicking.  They were They were about my height,  around 14 years old  their their shirts were yellow!  Yeah, make sure you get that down.  Any mutations, augmentations?  Three eyes? A tail? Maybe a buzz cut?  No. Just four normal Mortys.  Normal? Put it in your blog.  Let me turn over a few rocks.  Aw, geez. Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?  Aw, geez, man. Nothing, man.  We're just hanging out and stuff.  I hear that. Aw, geez.  I guess I'm supposed to be figurin' out  who robbed the store across the street.  But, aw, geez, I don't know.  Aw, geez man, that sucks  that your Rick's making you do that.  He's not my Rick. He's my partner.  Aw, geez.  Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference,  who am I to say.  To me, you just look like a sidekick.  Whoa! Call me a sidekick one more time!  Call me a sidekick!  Hey, man! Come on! Aw, geez!  Wanna see how I paint a wall?!  It was the Morty Town Locos, man!  The the Morty Town Locos!  Aah! Aah!  Do you realize how many codes you just violated?  Aw, geez, Rick.  What do I know about knowin' stuff?  Get in the [Bleep] car.  More lasers.  You could take more time  to answer the question if you like.  Okay, Juggling Rick,  how would you solve the Citadel's financial crisis?  First off, can I just say  that I believe this Citadel is the greatest  in the entire multiverse.  Now, I believe the answer to your question  has three parts.  First, education spending must get much higher  But it has to be balanced with defense  Whoa! Whoa! Can we fact check this please?  Never mind. Who am I kidding.  This race is over.  And that's how you run a Citadel!  Candidate Morty,  the number of displaced Mortys is soaring  while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting,  and the divide between the two groups  has never been wider.  Solve that one real quick.  I don't see a divide between Ricks and Mortys  Shocker.  I'd like to offer a rebuttal.  Gentlemen, gentlemen,  I think we can all agree on one thing  Well, it came out as two things  but you get the idea.  You guys finished?  The division I see  is between the Ricks and Mortys  that like the Citadel divided  and the rest of us.  I see it everywhere I go.  I see it in our schools  where they teach Mortys we're all the same,  because they're threatened by what makes us unique.  I see it in our streets  where they give guns to Mortys,  so we're too busy fighting each other  to fight real injustice.  I see it in our factories  where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss' salary  even though they're identical and have the same IQ.  The Citadel's problem isn't homeless Mortys  or outraged Ricks.  The Citadel's problem is the Ricks and Mortys  feeding on the Citadel's death  Holy [Bleep]  Rick Security Officer: He's headed for the flavor core!  But I've got a message for them,  from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive,  a message from the Ricks and Mortys  that believe in this Citadel  to the Ricks and Mortys that don't.  You're outnumbered.  Holy [Bleep]  I don't believe it.  II can't believe it.  I know. That's why you're fired.  Sounds like you're looking for work.  I can offer you  a very enticing compensation package.  First, let's talk benefits  Daddy loves you. That's Daddy's good girl.  Your life is a lie, man.  All your life's are lies!  Don't you get it?!  They told us we were special because we were Ricks,  but they stripped us of everything that made us unique!  We know how you feel.  We're workingstiff Ricks just like you.  But our assembly line is justice.  What are your demands?  III want a portal gun.  Unregistered, untraceable,  with enough fluid to take me off this God damn prison!  The media's outside. Well, keep 'em there.  Anyway, so yeah, the suspect says the Citadel's a lie,  built on lies, and some other shit.  I say appreciate the life you have,  because it can always be worse.  Back to you, Ricks.  Thank you, Rick 0716C.  That [Bleep] guy. Tell me about it.  Meanwhile, in election news,  an unexpected turn of events  as Morty from the Morty Party  soars to the top of the polls.  Yes.  Morty, what's your original reality and where's your Rick?  Gosh, we moved around so much it's hard to remember.  I see every Rick as my Rick,  I hope they see me as their Morty.  Another? Please? With less water?  Hey, cheer up, pal.  A Morty's gonna be president.  Imagine this kisser  getting blamed for everything.  I guess I should've had more faith.  It's not faith you need. It's fear.  What's this?  It's secrets.  Wh wh wh What do you think it is?  Look at how I'm dressed.  Rick Reporter: Having taken aim at the system,  are afraid at all for your safety?  Candidate Morty: I'd rather live in hope than fear.  If I had to fear anything,  I'd fear other people being afraid.  Of fear. Itself.  But. No, I'm not afraid.  you gonna lick my balls or what?  Sheeeet, grandson,  you keep me peelin' skrabquams and slippin' nib nibs,  I'll lick whatever ain't nailed down.  Hands in the air!  What the hell, man?! What the hellin' hell?  You guys doing a little chemistry homework  with Grandpa? Is this what I think it is?  Bootleg portal fluid.  I guess his math was off.  Search the place.  Are are you my new R Rick?  It's okay, Morty.  Jesus.  He stabbed me. He got me bad, Morty.  Shh. It's okay. You're okay.  You were right.  Everything I learned at the academy was Doesn't matter.  Nothing's wrong with putting your faith in a Morty.  You just gotta pick the right one.  Why is there a crib in here?  Something they do. To make you feel bad.  Boy, I got us kneedeep in paperwork?  Go to the car and grab a medipack.  Let me worry about this.  What happened? Same old story  Mortys killing Mortys.  Almost got it  Farmer Rick: Hey!  Y'all get the hell away from my damn mega fruit!  Sic 'em, boy!  I don't wear this dagnab hat  and commit to this rural character  so you can eat for free while you come of age!  I bet the Wishing Portal leads to a reality  where they're Where all  Where it's a bunch of French toast with boobies.  I bet it leads to a place with a bunch of fry  Fly flies everywhere.  Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.  I bet it's a big hole  where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams.  Slick, why do you have to be so dramatic?  You wanna know why? Because of this.  I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys  with a drama implant.  How do you think it feels, Fat Morty,  to know that no matter where I go,  I'll always be the one  that makes everybody sad and a little bored.  Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay?  You also roll up your sleeves.  I thought I was LeftHanded Morty.  Then you should use your left hand  to eat more vegetables.  Hey, there. How you doing? Great to meet you.  I'm a plumber, sir.  I'm a Rick, and I'm a plumber.  That doesn't sound like Rick work.  You didn't come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you?  Ha! Ha! I sure didn't, sir!  Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty!  I cloned myself so you could kiss me as a baby!  This is just like a Morty baby!  Hey, did you,  end up getting a new job?  Yeah, I did.  Assassinating you.  I'm okay  I'm okay  I'm  Aw, man. Aw, geez.  Aw, hah.  You look like you could use a good time.  One dance for $10, two for $25.  No, thank you And bad math.  Ha! Ha! Yeah! This is a good time!  What is this place? The Creepy Morty.  What is it your kind's always saying  "Don't think about it."  Come on.  There's someone important I want you to meet.  Bubbala!  How'd it go with the Morty Town Locos?  They had a little accident.  They won't be causing any trouble anymore.  Those were bad Mortys. Very bad Mortys.  Big Morty likes to contribute  to keeping the peace in Morty Town.  Think of him as a "drug lord"  and us as cops on his payroll.  Morty   Which Morty?  Which Morty?  M m my partner.  Morty, you're right. Morty Town is bad.  But that doesn't mean that we have to be.  Hey, what's going on here, Morty?   Which Morty?  Which Morty?  The cop, morons!  Don't worry about Rick, Big Morty.  He's new.  He doesn't understand how it works.  That's what you said about your last partner.  Why would you say something like that, Big Morty?  You're [Bleep] things up for both of us here. Wrong.  He's [Bleep] things up for both of you.  Unless he takes the money.  Big Morty, you're under arrest.  S smartest man in the universe.  They're just props! Th they're just props!  Not so big now, are ya?  I never was! It was figurative!  That's enough. If we don't kill him, he'll talk.  If you do, I'll talk.  Cowboy Morty: O one thing's for sure,  Y y'all don't have to worry about Cowboy Morty talkin'.  This little cowpoke's gonna mosey up on out of here.  You told me to put my faith in the right Morty.  I've got faith in you, partner.  Do the right thing.  Grandpa Rick,  II don't wanna be on the Citadel anymore.  I wanna be a regular kid.  II wanna to go to school and throw balls around  and masturbate.  What the hell happened in there?  Same old story.  Ricks killing Mortys.  Okay, man, okay, we got your portal gun.  What the hell's he doing?  Where where am I? A bad place.  But you're going to a better one soon.  Hey! Hey!  No, no, no, no  Whaa  God damn it!  A portal to the blender dimension?  That's the oldest trick in the book!  I'm a Rick! I'm more Rick than any of you!  Then you should know you just killed your only leverage!  Then comes and get me, mother[Bleep]  Stop. I'm Rick D. Sanchez the Third,  owner of this here wafer establishment,  and I say that the Rick in there is right.  He's more Rick than any of you.  He's a terrorist!  What Rick isn't?!  This Citadel was founded by Ricks  for Ricks to be free!  What's your name, young man?  Rick. And I'm The same age as me, I know.  How long have you worked here? 15 years.  What the hell have we become?  Whatever time you were gonna make him serve,  he's served it.  It ends now.  Come with me, friend. Where are we going?  To your new life.  Which starts with walking the [Bleep] out of here.  Yo J22, give 'em hell!  Sam Elliot: There's a Rick that held a factory hostage  after murdering his boss and several coworkers.  The factory made cookies, flavored them with lies.  He made us all take a look at what we were doing.  And in the bargain, he got a taste of real freedom.  We captured that taste,  and we keep giving it to him  so he give it right back to you,  in every bite of new.  Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects.  Come home to the unique flavor  of shattering the grand illusion.  Come home to Simple Rick.  It is real.  After you.  Specs: There it is. The Wishing Portal.  They say for your wish to come true,  you have to give up something really important.  For me, that's my panini maker.  I wish for a million sandwiches.  And, yes, I see the irony.  I guess I wish I had something cooler  than this dumbass surfer necklace.  I wish incest porn had  Had a more mainstream appeal.  For For a friend of mine.  None of those things are gonna happen, you know.  Morty wishes never come true.  Not on the Citadel.  Then why did you bring us here?  Because I wish that would change.  I wish anything about this life would change.  Well, I hope you're putting something  pretty God damn important in there.  Me too.  But I doubt it.   No!  Slick!  M maybe  maybe it went somewhere nice.  Automated Rick: Garbage dump.  Stand back.  He had to be stopped.  He he cou he c Couldn't be allowed to win.  Then you should've worked on your aim, bro.  He's alive? No, no, no. You gotta listen to me.  II worked for him.  I was his campaign manager.  That Morty is not what he seems.  Yeah, well, no Morty seems like a president.  He won? Yeah.  It was a blow out.  I would hardly call it a blow out.  It was almost close enough to trigger a recount.  Jesus. What are you joke security now too?  Rick Cop: Why am I still here?  I heard he confessed to everything.  Your case has been reviewed. You're free to go.  But I violated at least a dozen departmental codes.  New department. New codes.  New Citadel.  Specs: Did we miss graduation?  Where are the new Ricks?  No graduation. No new Ricks.  The school's curriculum is changing. To what?  I don't know, and I don't have to know.  I've been fired.  Good luck, turds.  Holy crap. Slick's wish came true.  Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.  Had a little crisis at work. Worth it!  It's no problem.  A little more off the top.  You were saying, Garment District Rick.  We were saying, "President" Morty,  that we don't care who sits in that seat.  A Rick, a Morty, a god damn Jerry  It doesn't matter.  We've been running the Citadel since before the council  and you'll find that we're still running it now.  Does he really speak for everyone here?  Yeah.  Well, I think it's important to be clear.  Raise your hand if he speaks for you.  Is that enough off the top?  I don't know. Is it?   Yes, yes, god damn, yes.  I think it's great.  Good.  This seems like a good time for a drink  and a cold calculated speech with sinister overtones.  A speech about politics  About order  Brotherhood  Power.  But speeches are for campaigning.  Now is the time for action.  Whoo! Yeah!  Atlantis, baby! That was amazing.  You got some of that mermaid puss.  I'm really hoping it wasn't a oneoff thing and I can see her again.  By the way, hey, um,  you're still not curious about what  what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?  Psh. Not at all, Morty.  That place will never have  any bearing over our lives ever again.  Unlike that mermaid puss! Whoo!  Yeah! We're going back for seconds! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!  We're gonna do that shit every week, man!  That was Atlantis! Shit!
